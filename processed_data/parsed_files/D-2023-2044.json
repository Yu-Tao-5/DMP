To significantly reduce the costs, 3D cell cultures can be used in the nonclinical  \nin-vitro experiments. These cultures model the human body in a more accurate way than  \ntheir 2D counterparts, so clinical studies become more successful afterward. However, there are no  \nscalable multielectrode arrays (MEAs) that can interface 3D cultures and electronic circuits to achieve  \ncell resolution multimodal sensing. Therefore, the goal of the project is to enable high scalability of  \nIMEC’s perforated 3D MEAs, which today suffer from a limited number of electrodes, degraded signal  \nquality, limited functionality, and low yield. However, the small bridges between the sensing nodes of  \nthe 3D MEA make it very challenging to resolve those limitations. By using novel CMOS techniques  \nand circuits, the goal is to increase the electrode number, the recording performance, and integrate  \ndiverse functionalities: recording, stimulation, impedance monitoring and spectroscopy,  \nelectrochemical, and op tical detection. The outcome of the research will be the first demonstration of  \na fully -scalable active perforated 3D MEA for organoid monitoring and cell identification.  \n \nThe project will generate circuit schematics,  testbenches , and layouts during the design phas e; a Chip after \nfabrication; and experimental results during experimentation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   4 \n 2.

To significantly reduce the costs, 3D cell cultures can be used in the nonclinical in-vitro experiments. These cultures model the human body in a more accurate way than their 2D counterparts, so clinical studies become more successful afterward. However, there are no scalable multielectrode arrays (MEAs) that can interface 3D cultures and electronic circuits to achieve cell resolution multimodal sensing. Therefore, the goal of the project is to enable high scalability of IMEC’s perforated 3D MEAs, which today suffer from a limited number of electrodes, degraded signal quality, limited functionality, and low yield. However, the small bridges between the sensing nodes of the 3D MEA make it very challenging to resolve those limitations. By using novel CMOS techniques and circuits, the goal is to increase the electrode number, the recording performance, and integrate diverse functionalities: recording, stimulation, impedance monitoring and spectroscopy, electrochemical, and op tical detection. The outcome of the research will be the first demonstration of a fully -scalable active perforated 3D MEA for organoid monitoring and cell identification. The project will generate circuit schematics, testbenches , and layouts during the design phas e; a Chip after fabrication; and experimental results during experimentation.
