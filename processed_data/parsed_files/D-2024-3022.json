The viruses in\nthe gut are collectively referred as the gut virome and seem to play an important role in regulating our health and wellbeing. Current evidence suggests\nthat in humans, the composition of the gut virome is highly individual-specific and stays relatively stable over time, but the factors driving these\npatterns of composition are still poorly understood. Progress is hindered by a lack of standardized methods in virome research, and ethical and practical\nconsiderations that accompany experimental work and longitudinal sampling in humans. Animal studies, and especially in primates, offer a unique\npotential for larger experimental control and provide insight into the evolutionary processes that shaped the human gut virome. In this project, I will\nstudy the factors driving gut virome composition and stability in zoo-housed and wild bonobos (Pan paniscus). I will investigate to what extent virome\nprofiles are shaped by host-specific factors like sex, age or genetics, or rather by external factors like geography, diet and sociality using both a cross-\nsectional and a longitudinal sampling approach. I will also study the effects of antibiotic-use on the ability of the virome to increase the emergence of\nantibiotic-resistance genes through interaction with the gut bacteria, which could have major implications for human treatment protocols. \nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n07-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

All KU Leuven and CRC personnel has access to 2TB and 1TB of data storage on OneDrive, respectively. We do not plan to generate massive amounts of data, so these online storages should provide sufficient storage. If not, additional physical hard drives (5TB) can be bought for 150 euros. Costs will be covered by the research groups. The physical samples will be stored within available freezers in our laboratory. The costs of their storage is covered by the lab of Prof. Matthijnssens.
