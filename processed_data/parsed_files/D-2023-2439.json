For published papers, the subset of the raw and processed data discussed in that manuscript will be copied and organized according the paper structure. Likely, this is the data subset that will be most frequently revisited and shared afterwards. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 94.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data.☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☐ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☒ Other: The data will be stored via a cloud storage solution that allows sharing with the PIs and researchers involved in the larger scope of this project. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? ☐ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back-ups I make (specify) ☒ Other (specify) The data on the cloud storage server are automatically backed up. Unlimited versioning is included in the selected plan so that accidental erasing or modifying does not pose a risk. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes: The total amount of data generated during the project should not exceed a few TB and is therefore compatible with the selected cloud storage solution. ☐ No If no, please specify: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data The data generated during the project will be systematically transferred to the cloud storage server. Only the PIs will have access to the shared folders where the data, reports and presentations will be stored. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?The costs for saving the data to the cloud storage server (including regular backup) should not exceed a few hundred euros. These costs will be covered by the project. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): after the end of the project, one of the following options will be picked (1) continuation of storing the data on the cloud storage server or (2) transferring the data to the KU Leuven central servers for archiving. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?The annual cost for long-term storage of the data, either through a cloud storage service or the university's central servers, is estimated at a few hundred euro. Since the budget of the current project will no longer be available, creative solutions will have to be found. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☐ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☒ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: The data will remain accessible among the PI’s and the researchers involved in the broader scope of this project. Access to the data can be granted to other persons, upon request and agreement among the PIs. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Access to the data can be granted to other persons whom will contribute to the success or further success of this project, upon request and agreement among the PIs. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☒ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Other data repository (specify) ☐ Other (specify) When will the data be made available? ☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☒ Other (specify): termination of project funding FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. Check the RDR guidance on licences for data and software sources code or consult the License selector tool to help you choose. ☐ CC-BY 4.0 (data) ☒ Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) ☐ MIT licence (code) ☐ GNU GPL-3.0 (code) ☐ Other (specify) Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☒ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☐ No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Because of the choice for a cloud storage solution for the data, no additional costs will be booked for data sharing. 7. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project?Myself (grant holder) and my PI’s will be jointly responsible. Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project?Myself (grant holder) and my PI’s will be jointly responsible.
