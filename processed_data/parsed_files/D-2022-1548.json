Institutional \ninvestors, such as BlackRock and Vanguard, have rapidly increased in importance in recent years. Their \ngrowing diversified portfolios have led to a steep increase in common ownership, which in turn has raised \nconcerns worldwide about the potential distortion this creates into firms' decision making. Dubbed “the \nmajor new antitrust challenge of our time, ” common ownership is an important, new topic in competition \neconomics. But –although rapidly growing – research on the topic is still in its infancy. This project aims to \nassess in detail in US pharmaceutical industries the impact of common ownership on market entry \nstrategies, and to investigate the resulting welfare consequences. The aimed contribution of the project is \nto give new and detailed insights in large investors ’ influence in product markets, how this exactly affects \nfirms’ entry strategies, and the resulting market outcomes in an important and well-suited industry for the \nresearch questions at hand, i.e. pharma.  \n1. GENERAL INFORMATION\nName applicant\nJo Seldeslachts\nFWO Project Number & Title\nG0D1522N - CO in Pharma\nAffiliation\nKU Leuven\n2. DATA DESCRIPTION\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?  \nYes to both\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. \nThis may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and per WP or objective of the \n2project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of these data.  Distinguish data types (the \nkind of content) from data formats (the technical format).\nThe project is data-driven and seeks to answer how investors steer pharma companies' strategic \ndecisions.   The project will manage databases, based mainly secondary sources: the Thomson Reuters \n(TR) Global Ownership Database, the FDA Orange Book website, the The Par. IV Report and IMS \nHealth. The raw data format depends on the database. TR data can be downloaded in Excel, the FDA \nand Par IV data contain data in html format, whereas we don't know yet in which format IMS Health \ntransfers data. The TR data will be further cleaned with ultimate ownership data from NIC, which is in .txt \nformat. These quantitive data will be cleaned, organised and compiled together into one, using several \nprogramming tools (Python, Matlab, SQL, Stata). The analysis will be done in Matlab and Stata.  \n3. LEGAL AND ETHICAL ISSUES\nWill you use personal data?  If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add the \nreference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for Research and Public Service  \nPurposes (PRET application).   Be aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is  \na legal obligation.\nNo\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on \nhumans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant \nethical review committee(s)\nNo\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? \nWill IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions \nwill be asserted? \nNo\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If \nso, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nYes, some of the data used are based on commercial databases that restrict the use to 3rd parties.\n4. DOCUMENTATION AND METADATA\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this \nproject?\nThe target journals ask for a detailed database plan + replication script. We will, therefore, prepare these \nfor this project as well.\n3Will a metadata standard be used? If so,  describe in detail which standard will be used.  If no, \nstate in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse.\nSee the answer to the above question.\n5. DATA STORAGE AND BACKUP DURING THE FWO PROJECT\nWhere will the data be stored?  \nThe data will be stored on the KU Leuven cloud (+ a backup on the department server).  \nHow is backup of the data provided?\nSee above\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will  \nbe taken care of.\nYes, there should be enough capacity available on the KU Leuven cloud\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these \ncosts be covered? \nThe capacity is provided for free to KU Leuven researchers.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified \nby unauthorized persons?\nThe capacity is protected by the usual KU Leuven passwords.\n6. DATA PRESERVATION AFTER THE FWO PROJECT\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case \nonly a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or \ncontractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll data will be retained as publishing takes often longer than 5 years in economics.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nWe still have to decide this.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will  \nthe costs be covered?  \nThe capacity is provided for free to KU Leuven researchers.\n47. DATA SHARING AND REUSE\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in \nan agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nYes, most of it will be covered by legal restrictions.\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nThe meta-data and scripts to reproduce the data.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nMostly together with the journal publications.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nMostly together with the journal publications.\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nParties who have commercial agreements with the same databases, will be able to have access.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?  \nSee above.\n8. RESPONSIBILITIES\nWho will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?\nDr. Melissa Newham and the PI (Jo Seldeslachts) will be responsible.  \nWho will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nDr. Melissa Newham and the PI (Jo Seldeslachts) will be responsible.  \nWho will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ?\nDr. Melissa Newham and the PI (Jo Seldeslachts) will be responsible.  \nWho bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nThe PI (Jo Seldeslachts) ."
