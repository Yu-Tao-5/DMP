HOW WILL NEW DATA BE COLLECTED OR PRODUCED AND/OR HOW WILL EXISTING DATA BE  \nRE-USED?\nThe data generated in this project will include the following types:\nnumeric (databases of cell expression profiles, spreadsheets of histological and flow cytometric  \nevaluations, biomarkers, and of in vitro cell interaction results...  \nimages and video (cardiac structure and function analyses by echocardiography and histology)\ntextual (documents reporting on the results and conclusions (.doc, .pdf).\nOur project will entail data collection from in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro experiments, and ex vivo data from \nclinical samples. Historical data, produced in the period 2021-2024, will be re-used where necessary to  \nkeep in line with the 3Rs guiding experimental animal use notably for the HFpEF mouse models. No  \nconstraints are envisaged on such internal reuse of laboratory-generated data.\nData provenance will be documented in the file name such as:  Aquisitiondate-Echo-4wks-mDIVA.xls;  \nAquisitiondate-IHC-CD68 -20x-mDIVA.xls ; Aquisitiondate-ELISA-4wks-mDIVA.xls\nClinical data will be handled by each PI according to national legislation on handling and sharing of  \nprotected data (see section 4A).\n1B. WHAT DATA (FOR EXAMPLE THE KIND, FORMATS, AND VOLUMES), WILL BE COLLECTED OR  \nPRODUCED?\nThe in vivo data will include: echocardiography, exercise tolerance, blood pressure, body weight gain, blood  \nflow cytometry, plasma dosage by ELISA or Multiplex arrays of cytokines or antibodies, and morphometry,  \nas well as bulk RNAseq. The file format used for data compilation and statistical analysis is principally excel \nspreadsheets (.xls) and prism (.pzfx). For expression analyses, we will commit to standards accepted by  \ndata repositories (fq.gz.) to facilitate sharing and long-term re-use of data.\nThe ex vivo data will include cardiac flow cytometry, cardiac single cell RNAseq or bulk RNAseq, tissue  \nqPCR, tissue homogenate ELISAs, histology (light microscopy), immunohistochemistry (fluorescence  \nmicroscopy, confocal imaging, and lightsheet imaging), western blot, and biochemical assays. The file  \nformat used for data compilation and statistical analysis is principally excel spreadsheets (.xls) and prism \n(.pzfx)  for  numerical  data.  For  imaging  data  we  will  use  ImageJ/Imaris  compatible  formats  \n(.ims; .tif , .jpeg, .zvi  or .avi), for echocardiography we will use software specific dataoutput which is  \nsummarized in excel spreadsheets (DICOM; (.xls). and for flow cytometric evaluations we will use excel \nspreadsheets and FlowJo formats (.xls and wsp.). Transcriptomic data from scRNAseq, will be analyzed in  \nSeurat (.R) and visualized in Cerebro (.crb; .rds), Files will also be generated for data analysis  using excel  \nspreadsheets (.xls) and prism (.prism; .pzfx) for processed data outputs. For expression analyses, outputs  \ninclude cvs.gz and .txt; .rds and cbs. We will commit to standards accepted by data repositories to facilitate  \nsharing and long-term re-use of data. \nThe in vitro data will include read-outs from cell culture or co-culture experiments including flow cytometry,  \ncell proliferation assay, migration assay, and cell activation assays, immunocytochemistry (fluorescence  \nmicroscopy, confocal imaging), as well as secretome analysis by ELISAs and cell analysis by luminometry  \nassays or western blot assays or qPCR.

DOCUMENTATION AND DATA QUALITY\n2A. WHAT METADATA AND DOCUMENTATION (FOR EXAMPLE THE METHODOLOGY OF DATA  \nCOLLECTION AND WAY OF ORGANISING DATA) WILL ACCOMPANY THE DATA?\nThe metadata that will be provided include word file listing the conditions of the experiment, coupled to excel  \nfiles listing the unique sample identifiers in each group. We will use the metadata standards developed by  \nRDA MIBBI (Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations) Metadata Standards  \nhttps://rdamsc.bath.ac.uk/msc/m23\nThe data will be organized in project folders, containing subfolders for different types of experiments, such  \nas in vivo study 1 / 4 weeks timepoint / Immunohistochemistry analysis / Macrophage levels. Version control \nwill be ensured by listing v1.; v2. etc in the filename, with the final version annotated FINAL.\nThe raw data analysis excel sheet will refer to the protocol used for data collection (noted initially in lab  \nnotebooks, and later transcribed to readme files), collected in a separate folder ‘protocols’. Units of measure  \nwill be standardized, such as cells/mm²; cells/mg, or conc pg/mL except for gene expression analyses that  \nare reported as fpkm for Bulk Rnaseq or as ‘ normalized expression level’  for scRNAseq.\n2B. WHAT DATA QUALITY CONTROL MEASURES WILL BE USED?\nNew collected data will be compared to historical laboratory-generated data to ensure that no technical  \ndeviation in sensitivity of techniques or changes in operating procedures will affect the readout. For most of  \nthe variables analysed, the laboratory has established SOPs that define machine settings (exposure times \non microscopes, laser settings on flow cytometers, thresholds on echocardiographs,..) and normalization  \nprocedures for the data collection (timeline for echocardiography or organ collection, plasma sample  \nhandling, cell incubation times, ..). Data reproducibility is monitored by inclusion of sample duplicates or  \ntriplicates, depending on the technique, and repetition of the experiments for independent validation and  \ninclusion of necessary n for in vivo experiments. Data entry validation in excel sheets is performed by an  \nindependent actor verifying individual data points for each animal and each group, notably to identify outliers  \nthat may indicate data entry or technical errors. Peer review of data is performed at the stage of data  \npublication, with access to individual data points in all measurements.\n3. STORAGE AND BACKUP DURING THE RESEARCH PROCESS\n3A. HOW WILL DATA AND METADATA BE STORED AND BACKED UP DURING THE RESEARCH?\nAll research data generated in our laboratories will be recorded in personal laboratory protocol books and  \nupdated by each lab member on a daily basis. An electronic copy of all collected data is produced at least  \nonce per week on a joint secure server, or on OneDrive several times per day. Additional in-house backups  \nare generated on individual external hard-drives dedicated to each operator. The raw data on institutional  \n3servers is backed up for long-term storage (>10 years) on secure space hard-drives (managed by  \nuniversity).\n3B. HOW WILL DATA SECURITY AND PROTECTION OF SENSITIVE DATA BE TAKEN CARE DURING  \nTHE RESEARCH\nRemote access to data servers ensures access to raw data in case of onsite incident excluding access to  \nlaboratory computers. The raw data and analysed data will be freely shared within the laboratory on a daily  \nbasis, whereas exchanges with collaborators with exchanges of analysed data, or raw data as needed, will  \nbe performed either by email (Outlook) or by secure server filesharing. For sharing of sensitive data  \nbetween Partners only transfer through adapted secure applications including Microsoft Teams/Sharepoint  \nand Inserm Renater FileSender 2.0 will be used.\n4. LEGAL AND ETHICAL REQUIREMENTS, CODE OF CONDUCT\n4A. IF PERSONAL DATA ARE PROCESSED, HOW WILL COMPLIANCE WITH LEGISLATION ON  \nPERSONAL DATA AND ON SECURITY BE ENSURED?\nAny clinical data will be handled in agreement with national regulations and international legislation and  \napplicable codes of conduct including: the Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the EU; the Declaration of  \nHelsinki (2008); the Convention of the Council of Europe on Human Rights and Biomedicine; the European  \nParliament and Council Directive 2016/679; and the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and  \nHuman Rights adopted by UNESCO. Participants will comply with all national legislation and regulations  \nregarding Biomedical Research and Protection of Patient data (GDPR). Approval of the Institutional Ethics  \nCommittees will be obtained prior to starting any research and all data will be pseudo-anonymized and  \ncoded.\nSpain: Spanish legislation regarding biomedical research and the protection of patient data is also complied  \nwith; Law 14/2007 on biomedical research; Law 3/2018 on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee  \nof Digital Rights (LOPD); Law 41/2002 on rights and obligations in relation to clinical data; RD 1716/2011  \nthat regulates biobanks and the use of samples for research.\nStorage & Archiving : Only authorized personnel will have access to the patient’s personal data and the  \nunblinding code will be kept in a password-protected file on a secure server. Clinical data will be uploaded  \nthough a secure website, and all databases will be password-protected and encrypted. To comply with FAIR  \nprinciples, data generated in the project will be made accessible for verification and re-use for subsequent  \nresearch in due time. Curation of datasets pertaining to the results of this proposal will be standardized to  \noptimize the benefits for future studies of data acquired in our project. This standardized curation must also  \nensure the privacy of all participants and confidentiality of individual data (only pseudo-anonymized  \nanalysed data to be shared between Partners, and, following publication, with the scientific community).\nOnly pseudo-anonymized data will be shared with the partners of the consortium.\n4B.  HOW  WILL  OTHER  LEGAL  ISSUES,  SUCH  AS  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY  RIGHTS  AND  \nOWNERSHIP, BE MANAGED? WHAT LEGISLATION IS APPLICABLE?\nConcerning the  Intellectual Property Rights  (IPR) regulations related to handling and exploitation of IP  \nemanating from our project, we will share newly created foreground IP by directly involved participants as  \ndefined and protected by the legal departments (TTOs) of each participant. The Partners will mutually agree  \nto grant each other access to foreground or background IP, as long as this is necessary for the partner to  \ncarry out the project. In this sense, the data will be curated and will be available for re-use in publicly  \navailable data sets (if possible from IP protection perspective). The Partners respective TTOs will be  \nresponsible for the protection of any exploitable result prior to publication. If patentable results are achieved,  \nworldwide patent search will be made to identify any prior disclosures, to assess novelty and patentability.  \nConfidentiality agreements will be signed before discussing sensitive results with interested third parties  \n4and  potential  end-users  (e.g.  pharmaceutical  companies,  bio-technological  SMEs).  M olecular  tools \ngenerated in the project will be freely distributed upon reasonable request to academic investigators for  \nnon-commercial use . Should IP arise that requires patent protection, we pledge to ensure that the  \ntechnology or material remains widely available to the research community\n4C. WHAT ETHICAL ISSUES AND CODES OF CONDUCT ARE THERE, AND HOW WILL THEY BE  \nTAKEN INTO ACCOUNT?\nNational codes of conducts and institutional ethical guidelines will be followed in the project to ensure RRI.\n5. DATA SHARING AND LONG-TERM PRESERVATION\n5A. HOW AND WHEN WILL DATA BE SHARED? ARE THERE POSSIBLE RESTRICTIONS TO DATA  \nSHARING OR EMBARGO REASONS?\nData sharing between Partners will be performed using adapted secure applications including  Inserm \nRenater FileSender. Processed and analyzed data will be made freely available, following IP protection and  \npeer-reviewed publication of our findings, on dedicated open access servers. These data collections will be  \nrendered freely Accessible, Reusable, and Searchable, if it is not IP or GDPR protected . In addition, both \nanalysed data and interpretations will be made freely available by deposition of manuscripts on open access  \nforums, such as bioRxiv, when appropriate. In parallel, experimental transcriptomic data, and metadata, will  \nbe deposited on dedicated specific portals, such as Differential Expression Atlas  maintained by the EMBL-\nEBI, following the principles of open science practice and EU RRI guidelines to maximize their potential to  \nbe Reused and Interoperable (RRI), when not covered by IP protection or GDPR.\nNo personal data of patients will be shared at any point. Any clinical data will be shared only if allowed by  \nGDPR.\nResults of the proposed research program will be submitted for publication in peer reviewed journals, and  \ndisseminated through active participation in national and international meetings. In addition, results will be  \nconveyed to the lay public through the press pages of both Institutions. To target more specifically  \ncommunities of HF patients, members of our consortium will participate in outreach activities such as Pint-\nof-Science and local public hospital information days.\n5B.  HOW  WILL  DATA  FOR  PRESERVATION  BE  SELECTED,  AND  WHERE  DATA  WILL  BE  \nPRESERVED LONG-TERM (FOR EXAMPLE A DATA REPOSITORY OR ARCHIVE)?\nThe French partner will use the Entrepot database ( https://recherche.data.gouv.fr/  ) to generate closed  \nDataverse collections for each study prior to publication, which will be freely accessible, according to FAIR  \nprinciples, after publication and IP protection.\nThe Spanish partner (FIMA) will use the REPISALUD repository.\nThe Belgium partner will use different international repositories. We will upload flow cytometery data to \nFlowRepository using the miFLowCyt standard.   We will upload the sequencing data (that is not IP \nprotected or GDPR protected) to the GEO repository using the MIAME standard.  \n5C. WHAT METHODS OR SOFTWARE TOOLS ARE NEEDED TO ACCESS AND USE DATA?\nPrior to publication and/or IP protection, raw data, processed (analyzed) data, and metadata will be  \ndeposited as  closed Dataverse collections , e.g. using Inserm data archiving (Entrepot de Données  \nl’Inserm: https://entrepot.recherche.data.gouv.fr/dataverse/inserm;jsessionid=29d1d6f563da69d1c2d57b696a88  \n55D. HOW WILL THE APPLICATION OF A UNIQUE AND PERSISTENT IDENTIFIER (SUCH AS A  \nDIGITAL OBJECT IDENTIFIER (DOI)) TO EACH DATA SET BE ENSURED?\nPersistent identifiers will be applied at data deposition as closed Dataverse collections , e.g. using \nInserm data archiving (Entrepot de Données l’Inserm: \nhttps://entrepot.recherche.data.gouv.fr/dataverse/inserm;jsessionid=29d1d6f563da69d1c2d57b696a88  \n6. DATA MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES AND RESOURCES\n6A. WHO (FOR EXAMPLE ROLE, POSITION, AND INSTITUTION) WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DATA  \nMANAGEMENT (I.E. THE DATA STEWARD)?\nData management activities will be shared between the local PI and local project members in regard to data  \ncapture, metadata production, data quality, storage and backup, data archiving, and data sharing. E  \nBrakenhielm will manage the long-term backup on shared data from the project on institutional servers, and  \nhandle the dataverse collections, as well as requests for raw data sharing from individuals interested in the  \nproject. She is responsible for updating the DMP on an annual basis.\n6B. WHAT RESOURCES (FOR EXAMPLE FINANCIAL AND TIME) WILL BE DEDICATED TO DATA  \nMANAGEMENT  AND  ENSURING  THAT  DATA  WILL  BE  FAIR  (FINDABLE,  ACCESSIBLE,  \nINTEROPERABLE, RE-USABLE)?\nThe data storage is covered by the overhead costs for our institutes (Rouen University and Inserm) and no  \nextra costs have been identified. The time allocated to data handling is estimated at 2-15h per month, to be  \nshared between the local PI and local project members."
