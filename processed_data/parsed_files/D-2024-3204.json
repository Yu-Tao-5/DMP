Physical data are all materials that need proper \nmanagement because they are valuable, difficult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated.  Materials that are  not considered data  in an RDM context \ninclude your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under \ndocumentation/metadata.  \nRDM Guidance on data  \nIf you reuse existing data, please specify the \nsource, preferably by using a persistent \nidentifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per \ndataset or data type.  Recruitment for adolescents (14-17 years old) will rely on a secondary dataset of adolescent MDA users \npreviously collected by the Media Psychology Lab. Parents of adolescents who participated in the prior \nresearch will be asked to provide consent for their children’s participation. These parents will not be \ninformed if their child was identified as a mobile dater in the previous research.

In this approval application, we \nthoroughly explain how we will pseudonymise the data and which particular safety measures will be \ntaken. \nFocus group interviews: The in-depth interviews will be recorded in order to make transcription and data \nanalysis possible. Whilst transcribing these recordings, we will anonymize them right away (only fictive \nname, gender, and age will be kept). To create the fictional name, we will store participants' names in a \nseparate, password protected file. This file can only be accessed by the researchers working on this project  \nand will not be distributed to third parties. When the interviews are transcribed, this file will be deleted.  \nCross-sectional survey: we will provide each participant with a unique identification code. The \nidentification codes will only be used by the researchers. All information that allows identification of the \nparticipants (e.g., email address) will be kept in a separate data file that will be encrypted and can only be \naccessed by a password known by the primary researcher. Furthermore, this file will be deleted as soon as \nthe research project is completed.\nESM study: We will provide each participant with a unique identification code to link the background \nquestionnaire to the daily dairy checklists.

After data collection, data will be downloaded from the Avicenna app and analysed using R. GUIDANCE: The data description forms the basis of your entire DMP, so make sure it is detailed and complete. It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all materials that need proper management because they are valuable, difficult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentation/metadata. RDM Guidance on data If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type. Recruitment for adolescents (14-17 years old) will rely on a secondary dataset of adolescent MDA users previously collected by the Media Psychology Lab. Parents of adolescents who participated in the prior research will be asked to provide consent for their children’s participation. These parents will not be informed if their child was identified as a mobile dater in the previous research. After obtaining consent, adolescents who self-identified as mobile daters will be invited to join the new study to explore their mobile dating experiences. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 8Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number.☒ Yes, human subject data; provide SMEC or EC approval number: currently being processed ☐ Yes, animal data; provide ECD reference number: ☐ Yes, dual use; provide approval number: ☐ No Additional information: Data will be collected among young individuals aged 12 to 25. No special categories of personal data will be collected and special attention will be paid to the privacy/anonymity of participants. Ethical approval has been obtained. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9Will you process personal data4? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number).☒ Yes (provide PRET G-number or EC S-number below) ☐ No Additional information: We will work with pseudonymised/anonymized data and have received ethical approval for this via the PRET platform ( currently being processed ). In this approval application, we thoroughly explain how we will pseudonymise the data and which particular safety measures will be taken. Focus group interviews: The in-depth interviews will be recorded in order to make transcription and data analysis possible. Whilst transcribing these recordings, we will anonymize them right away (only fictive name, gender, and age will be kept). To create the fictional name, we will store participants' names in a separate, password protected file. This file can only be accessed by the researchers working on this project and will not be distributed to third parties. When the interviews are transcribed, this file will be deleted. Cross-sectional survey: we will provide each participant with a unique identification code. The identification codes will only be used by the researchers. All information that allows identification of the participants (e.g., email address) will be kept in a separate data file that will be encrypted and can only be accessed by a password known by the primary researcher. Furthermore, this file will be deleted as soon as the research project is completed. ESM study: We will provide each participant with a unique identification code to link the background questionnaire to the daily dairy checklists. The identification codes will only be used by the researchers and solely for the purpose of linking participants’ data over different data collection points. All information that allows identification of the participants (e.g., email address) will be kept in a separate data file that will be encrypted and can only be accessed by a password known by the primary researcher. Furthermore, this file will be deleted as soon as the research project is completed.
