The input-files used for the simulation will\nbe kept insight the same folder. The name of the folder will contain the composition, temperature and a reference to the loading\nconditions of the considered material. A .txt file explaining the naming will be maintained and kept together with the data sets.\nReduced key datasets underlying a publication (up to 50 GB) will be made available through Mendeley with a mentioning that the\nfull data set can be accessed upon request. DOIs will be appointed to these key datasets.\n2) The \nscripts implementing the calculation of the tensor TWIN models\nscripts implementing the calculation of the tensor TWIN models\n will get unique names referring to the procedure they\nimplement. An extensive explanation of the input and output variables and the outline of the program will be given at the top of\nthe file. The new procedures will be documented in the reports (data set 4) and a clear reference to the report name and version\nwill be given in the description in the matlab file (and vice versa, the supporting documents will be clearly mentioned in the\nscripts).  The procedures to calculate the tensor models will initially not be made publicly available until a decision has been made\nabout the patentability of the approach. In a later stage they may still be made publicly available through Mendeley with a manual\ndescribing the approaches and how to apply them on output from phase-field simulations (possibly, after negotiation with the\ndevelopers of the TensorLab toolbox (http://www.tensorlab.net/), they may also be added as part of the TensorLab toolbox and\ndescribed in the on-line manual). When the procedures are publicly published,  an associated journal paper will also be published\nrefering to the data set on Mendeley (and or the function in the TensorLab toolbox). When published on Mendeley, a doi will be\nappointed to the whole set of scripts. \n3) \nThe digital TWIN models \nThe digital TWIN models \nof microstructure evolution consist of numerical data represented in the form of matrices ('the factor\nmatrices of the tensor decomposition'). \nThey will be saved in folders per simulation test following the same structure as those used for the raw simulation data 1) and\nusing file names consistent with those used for the raw simulation data.   The tensor descriptions will be proceded by metadata\ncontaining information on the elements included, the temperature and composition range and the name of the procedure used to\nobtain them. A procedure to automatically generate these metadata will be implemented. The models that can be published will\nbe published together with the key data set of raw materials  (on Mendeley and hence recieve a unique doi)\n4) When possible, reports will be published in the form of journal papers. They will be open access true the gold or green route (by\nuploading the postprint in LIRIAS, the open access repository of KU Leuven).  For presentations, a pdf will be uploaded in LIRIAS. \nIn all cases, the METADATA will also contain links to relevant publications and manuals, as well as a relevant contacting address\n(nele.moelans@kuleuven.be).\n2. Making data openly accessible\n2. Making data openly accessible\n1) The simulation data themselves will be saved on archive space at the VSC-KU Leuven\n(https://icts.kuleuven.be/sc/onderzoeksgegevens/HPC-storage). Because of their huge size, it is difficult to find an appropriate\nplace to make them publicly available. We will give people access upon request. When needed, we can put the data temporarily\non a place with fast access. We will make them available under a CC-BY license. Reduced key datasets underlying a publication\n(up to 50 GB) will be made available through Mendely under CC-BY license (or in a repository advised by the journal if possible).\n2) Depending on the interest of companies, the patentability of the approach and possible further use of the scripts in follow-\nprojects, these data may not or only be made publicly available after a certain embargo time. the scripts will be saved in a joint \nfolder (on the KU Leuven institutional drives) to which a limited number of people have access. The scripts can be used within\nMatlab and using the TensorLab toolbox (open source toolbox: \nhttp://www.tensorlab.net/license.txt\n)   \n3) Depending on the interest of companies, the patentability of the approach and possible further use  in follow-projects, of the\ndata representing the tensor models may not or only be made publicly available after a certain embargo time. The data will be\nsaved in a joint folder to which a limited number of people have access. They will be saved in different format and hence can be\nused in various codes.  \n4) Also the reports and presentations will be stored in the joint folder on a KU Leuven drive with limited access, until they can be\npublished. \nWhen 2) ,3),4) can be made publicly available, this will be done through Mendeley, most likely under CC-BY license. \n3. Making data interoperable\n3. Making data interoperable\n1) The raw data will be saved using csv format, which can be loaded by most simulation and visualization software. \n2) The scripts for calculating the tensor TWIN models are generally applicable to microstructure data sets. The scripts use\nMATLAB in combination with the open source Matlab toolbox TensorLab (\nhttp://www.tensorlab.net/license.txt)\n.\n3) The datasets representing the tensor TWIN models are limited in size and will be stored using different file formats. They can\nbe used within any software. Example scripts (matlab, c++) will be provided showing how to use the data. \n4) Reports and presentations will be made using word, powerpoint and LaTeX, but a .pdf of all files will be stored as well. \n4. Increase data re-use\n4. Increase data re-use\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 20 February 2025\n4 of 5\n1) The large raw data sets will be available until at least 10 years after the end of the project under CC-BY license. The selected\ndata sets stored in a Mendeley repository will be permanently available under CC-BY. A csv file format is used which can be\nloaded by most simulation and visualization software.\n2)+3)+4) Depending on the interest of companies, the patentability of the approach and possible further use of the scripts in\nfollow-projects, these data may not or only be made publicly available after a certain embargo time or under restricted licensing.\nWhen publication of the data is allowed, they will be published through Mendeley and remain permanently available. The\ncomputed TWIN models are system specific, but the scripts to compute the models are generally applicable to microstructure\nevolution data for any type of material. \nPublications will as much as possible refer to the open data and their locations. We will make sure that a possible embargo time\nfor the publications is not longer than 6 months. We will advertise the publications and data locations on the group website and\nat conference presentations\n5. Allocation of resources and data security\n5. Allocation of resources and data security\nMost of the material, except for the raw simulation data, can be saved and made publicly available at now cost (through the\nMendeley repository).\nThe raw simulation data (as well as a copy of all the other data generated within the project) will be archived on the VSC-KU\nLeuven (https://icts.kuleuven.be/sc/onderzoeksgegevens/HPC-storage) at a price of 20 euro per Terrabyte per year. The price\nalso includes 'staging' space, to where the data can be copied (relatively fast) temporarily to use it in computations. It is possible\nto give external researchers a temporary vsc account so that they can access and use these data on the VSC, avoiding the time\nand difficulties associated with copying a large data set to external infrastructure. We expect that by the end of the project, we\nwill need approx. 2-3 Terrabyte, i.e. a cost of 60 euro per year. During the project, this cost will be booked on the project. Since this\nproject will most probably feed into future related projects, we will foresee budget allocation in these projects for long-term\nstorage of the data.\nThe data 2)+3)+4) will also be stored on the local institutional drive (Storage facilities of the research unit) which is backed up.\nThe foreseen disk space will be connected to the research group and the personnel number of prof. Nele Moelans and is at no\ncost. A copy of all the data will also be kept at the VSC-KU Leuven archive/staging space, which is backed-up daily.\nThe PI, Nele Moelans, will be responsible for implementing the DMP and assures that all data will be saved until at least 10 years\nafter the end date of the project according to KU Leuven data management rules. She will update the DMP anytime conditions\nchange. A  final reviewed DMP will be sent along with the final report.\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 20 February 2025\n5 of 5"
