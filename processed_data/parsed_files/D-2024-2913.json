Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). Each researcher keeps a digital lab notebook with a description of all performed experiments. The lab notebook contains information on how data were generated: the composition, method, temperature, incubation conditions, and a reference to the loading conditions of the considered material. In addition, modifications to protocols are written down in the lab notebook and the place where the material is being stored is also mentioned in the lab notebook. The digital lab notebook is stored on the J-drive and, once the research project has ended, will be stored on the K-drive for long-term storage. Raw data files of read-outs, analyzed data and statistical analyses are being stored on the J-drive and will be transferred to the K-drive at the end of the research project. The name of the folder of the saved data refers to the date, project, specifications and version of the data. All folders are organized on the j-drive according to the project, results, proposal, papers, presentation, administration, … Each researcher has access to his/her folder on the j-drive and a common folder of the lab containing protocols, list of plasmids, list of antibodies, list of cell lines. Only the PI and the lab manager have access to all folders. Furthermore, data will be made available to the broad audience as publications in peer reviewed journals. All data, constructs, cell and animal models will be made available upon reasonable request. Created using DMPonline.be.

Where will the data be stored? Each researcher will store his/her data in their personal folder on the j-drive. This is our data repository for short term storage which is expandable, fast and the data can be modified by the researcher itself. Only the PI and the lab manager have access to all the folders of the j- drive. When a paper is published, the data will be moved to our k-drive. This is our repository for data archiving, for long term storage. Only the PI and the lab manager can move the data to this drive, but data on this drive cannot be modified or deleted. Only the ICT service can do this. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? An automatic back-up service is provided by our ICT service.

How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Data are not saved locally on laptop/desktop but are stored in the KU Leuven secure data center. Only two people have access to all folders: the PI and the lab manager.
