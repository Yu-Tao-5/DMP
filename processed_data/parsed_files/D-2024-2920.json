The F WO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official  start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO \nbut to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel.  Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.  \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation  Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives  of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions.  This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary  of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.  \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   2 \n 1.

So far, sociolinguistics has focused \nprimarily on the language of working class migrants,  paying particular attention  to non standard \nphenomena. Hardly any research has been conducted on the evolution of the standard language \nof highly educated speakers who leave the homeland.  \n \nThis project addresses these research gaps by using a crowdsourcing application (SPEAK -IT!, \ndevelo ped by Daniel Wanitsch ) to investigate how standard language norms acquired in the home \ncountry evolve in the repertoires of highly educated Italians living abroad. These 'elite'  migrants \nrepresent an ideal test case, since they are assumed to master the two standard norms that \ncharacterize contemporary Italian: a literary  standard and a so -called neostandard Italian. The \nemergence of the latter variety is to be understood against the background of de - and \nrestandardization  dynamics attested in many European standard languages. This project examines \nstandard language change outside of Italy by  comparing language production and language \nperception in terms of the duration of migration of the speakers. Data collected in Switzerland and  \nBelgium will be combined with control data collecte d in Italy.  \n \nThere will be an App developed by Daniel Wanitsch that facilitates data collection  \nimmensely. We will therefore rely on(a) questionnaire data and (b) more or less 180 75min interviews  \nfrom our speakers, which amounts to 225 hours of recordings in total.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   4 \n 2.

For each data type (self -\nrecordings, interviews, and tasks), the project team will produce detailed documentation consisting of \nmetadata. This  thorough documentation covers aspects like questionnaire design, stimuli used, \ndemographics of the respondent pop ulation, and summaries of  findings. The data will be incorporated \ninto project outputs accessible to the public and disseminated upon depositing in a public repository  \n(LaRS  / SwissUBase and RDR Leuven) after project conclusion. These repositories assign m etadata \nstandardized according to Dublin Core, thus  enable findability of the data.  \n \nIn the aforementioned repositories a meticulous tree structure will serve as a navigational guide, leading \nusers to the desired information in a  self-explanatory manner.

If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities  are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.  ☒ Yes \n☐ No \nIf yes, please specify concisely:  Yes \n \nDuring the first 5 years, including the years of the project, the data will be stored on a Unix server at KU \nLeuven (cfr. supra:   https://icts.kuleuven.be/sc/storage/server -file-storage); automatic server backups are \nguaranteed at least once every 2 4h. \n \nIf no, please specify :  \n \n \n6 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric:  https://osf.io/2z5g3/  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   15 \n How will you ensure that the data are securely \nstored and not accessed or modified by \nunauthorized persons?  \n \nCLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , \nNETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND \nFILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT ST ORED AND \nTRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 6 \n  \nAll PCs purchased through the Faculty have Bitlocker pre -installed ; servers and databases can only be \naccessed with personal login data that is provided by the KU Leuven to the researchers involved in the  \nproject.  \n \nSAFE STORAGE OF PSEUDONIMISED SPOKEN DATA  \nSpoken data:  \n- A list of names (boys and girls) is created. Each name on the list is assigned a random number between 1 \nand 90.  \n- The names of the respondents are assigned a random sequence number.  \n- The sequence numbers are linked, and thus a random (girl or boy)  name is assigned to each respondent.  \n \nStorage mode: the PI keeps the key in a separate folder created specifically for this document. The keys \nare stored in a password -protected Word document. The key and the data are not in the same place.  \n \nThe online q uestionnaires are anonymous and thus don’t have to be pseudonomised or stored with a key . \n \n \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?   \nThe costs for storage and back up of the data, during the project, has been calculated to amount to 808.15  \neuros (this includes: KU Leuven's  ICTS container hosting platform for the SPEAK -IT app, the 'Small Volume \nServer: Type 1' and the Linux MySQL database hosting service).  \n \n \n \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   16 \n 5.

In case some data cannot be \npreserved , clearly state the reasons for this  \n(e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, insti tutional policies.. .).  \nIt is intended that all data will be preserved for longitudinal research, that is, kept for more than 10 years. \nThis approach is taken because the project marks the beginning of long -term research aimed at studying \nlanguage change t hroughout the life span of speakers.  \n \n \nWhere will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long -term)?   \nStorage capacity up to 5 years after the end of the project is already budgeted, and the data will be stored \non a Large Volume Storag e/L-drive  (capacity: 5 TB) at the KU Leuven (cost: 2.378,50 euros).  \n \nAfter the fifth year, we will reconsider how the s torage will be budgeted . However, the questionnaire and  \ntranscriptions occupy significantly less space than original recordings, and can therefore be kept on e xternal \nharddrives property of the  principal investigators of the project . \n \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during the expected retention \nperiod? How will these costs be covered?  \n \n \n  \n€ 3,186.65; these costs are covered by the FWO -Weave grant that funds the project.  \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   17 \n 6.

    "clean_full_text": "FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 1 FWO DMP Template - Flemish Standard Data Management Plan Project supervisors (from application round 2018 onwards) and fellows (from application round 2020 onwards) will, upon being awarded their project or fellowship, be invited to develop their answers to the data management related questions into a DMP. The F WO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning .

So far, sociolinguistics has focused primarily on the language of working class migrants, paying particular attention to non standard phenomena. Hardly any research has been conducted on the evolution of the standard language of highly educated speakers who leave the homeland. This project addresses these research gaps by using a crowdsourcing application (SPEAK -IT!, develo ped by Daniel Wanitsch ) to investigate how standard language norms acquired in the home country evolve in the repertoires of highly educated Italians living abroad. These 'elite' migrants represent an ideal test case, since they are assumed to master the two standard norms that characterize contemporary Italian: a literary standard and a so -called neostandard Italian. The emergence of the latter variety is to be understood against the background of de - and restandardization dynamics attested in many European standard languages. This project examines standard language change outside of Italy by comparing language production and language perception in terms of the duration of migration of the speakers. Data collected in Switzerland and Belgium will be combined with control data collecte d in Italy. There will be an App developed by Daniel Wanitsch that facilitates data collection immensely. We will therefore rely on(a) questionnaire data and (b) more or less 180 75min interviews from our speakers, which amounts to 225 hours of recordings in total.

Documentation and Metadata FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12 Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). A comprehensive codebook is currently under development, which will be a detailed explanation of each socio -demographic parameter, linguistic variable, and linguistic annotation . For each data type (self - recordings, interviews, and tasks), the project team will produce detailed documentation consisting of metadata. This thorough documentation covers aspects like questionnaire design, stimuli used, demographics of the respondent pop ulation, and summaries of findings. The data will be incorporated into project outputs accessible to the public and disseminated upon depositing in a public repository (LaRS / SwissUBase and RDR Leuven) after project conclusion. These repositories assign m etadata standardized according to Dublin Core, thus enable findability of the data. In the aforementioned repositories a meticulous tree structure will serve as a navigational guide, leading users to the desired information in a self-explanatory manner. Th is structure will facilitating an intuitive understanding of the various components of the data. The metadata associated with each file will include essential details such as a unique identifier (unique I D), the name of the person responsible for collecting or contrib uting the data, the name of the survey and the conditions for accessing the relevant data – while being completely anonymised. The process for the production dataset is slightly more complex, as each ID is also pseudonymized; this metad ata set is keyed securely. In addition, the data collection protocol, analysis methods, and decisions made are documented in a readme file. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metada ta standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: Metadata that is relevant for thi s project (mainly about sociodemographic information of the participants) will be kept in a separate csv -file that is generated from the MySQL database that is the initial storage for the collected metadata. We will use pseudoanonymization in order to prov ide unique codes to each participant and his/her metadata . 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? - for the metadata and the questionnaire data: a MySQL -database hosted by the KU Leuven (https://icts.kuleuven.be/sc/hosting/hostinglinuxmysql); capacity: < 1 GB - for the recordings: a Unix server hosted by the KU Leuven (https://icts.kuleuve n.be/sc/storage/server -file-storage); capacity: 1 TB - We will use the desktop file storage offered at KU Leuven, including central network folders KU Leuven OneDrive (this storage space is safe and automatically backed up). - We will also use two external hard drives for local storage . FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14 How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS , STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON -DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH .6 REFER TO INSTITUTION -SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE . - during the first 5 years, including the years of the project, the data will be stored on the Unix server (cfr. supra: https://icts.kuleuven.be/sc/storage/server -file-storage); automatic server backups ar e guaranteed at least once every 24h.; capacity: 1 TB - after the first 5 years (up to a total 10 years) the data will be stored on a large volume storage server at the KU Leuven: https://icts.kuleuven.be/sc/storage/grotevolumestorage; capacity: min. 5 TB - after 10 years the storage options will be re -evaluated. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: Yes During the first 5 years, including the years of the project, the data will be stored on a Unix server at KU Leuven (cfr. supra: https://icts.kuleuven.be/sc/storage/server -file-storage); automatic server backups are guaranteed at least once every 2 4h. If no, please specify : 6 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 15 How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT ST ORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 6 All PCs purchased through the Faculty have Bitlocker pre -installed ; servers and databases can only be accessed with personal login data that is provided by the KU Leuven to the researchers involved in the project. SAFE STORAGE OF PSEUDONIMISED SPOKEN DATA Spoken data: - A list of names (boys and girls) is created. Each name on the list is assigned a random number between 1 and 90. - The names of the respondents are assigned a random sequence number. - The sequence numbers are linked, and thus a random (girl or boy) name is assigned to each respondent. Storage mode: the PI keeps the key in a separate folder created specifically for this document. The keys are stored in a password -protected Word document. The key and the data are not in the same place. The online q uestionnaires are anonymous and thus don’t have to be pseudonomised or stored with a key . What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The costs for storage and back up of the data, during the project, has been calculated to amount to 808.15 euros (this includes: KU Leuven's ICTS container hosting platform for the SPEAK -IT app, the 'Small Volume Server: Type 1' and the Linux MySQL database hosting service). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 16 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, insti tutional policies.. .). It is intended that all data will be preserved for longitudinal research, that is, kept for more than 10 years. This approach is taken because the project marks the beginning of long -term research aimed at studying language change t hroughout the life span of speakers. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? Storage capacity up to 5 years after the end of the project is already budgeted, and the data will be stored on a Large Volume Storag e/L-drive (capacity: 5 TB) at the KU Leuven (cost: 2.378,50 euros). After the fifth year, we will reconsider how the s torage will be budgeted . However, the questionnaire and transcriptions occupy significantly less space than original recordings, and can therefore be kept on e xternal harddrives property of the principal investigators of the project . What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? € 3,186.65; these costs are covered by the FWO -Weave grant that funds the project. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 17 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available.
