Exemplar-driven and index-driven\nlectal contamination.\nA Data Management Plan created using DMPonline.be\nCreator: \nDirk Pijpops\nAffiliation: \nKU Leuven (KUL)\nFunder: \nFonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)\nTemplate: \nFWO DMP (Flemish Standard DMP)\nGrant number / URL: \n1212623N\nID: \n198432\nStart date: \n15-09-2024\nProject abstract:\nMechanisms of language variation and change often take as starting point lexical biases in grammatical variation, i.e. the finding that\nparticular words engender speakers to prefer one construction over another while forming utterances. For example, a frequent word that\nis biased towards a construction may attract similar words through analogy, creating a new conjugation class. What is unclear, however,\nis how such lexical biases develop in the first place.\nTo understand this, the project introduces two mechanisms that can create such lexical biases, viz. exemplar-driven and index-driven\nlectal contamination. Both mechanisms start from language contact between two varieties of the same language, but differ in how such\ncontact leads to lexical biases within the varieties. Exemplar-driven contamination relies on the cognitive storage of exemplars, while\nindex-driven contamination assumes that the words and constructions act as social indices.\nA pilot study focusing on nominal morphological variation has already been completed, with positive results. The project will conduct four\nmore corpus-based case studies that test the effect of both mechanisms among other types of variation. Next, I will build an agent-based\nsimulation of each mechanism. This will allow me to validate both mechanisms in-silico and derive exact theoretical predictions for each\nmechanism. Finally, these predictions will be put to the test through corpus research and a forced-choice and receptive experiment.\nLast modified: \n06-04-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project. For each dataset or data type (observational,\nexperimental etc.), provide a short name & description (sufficient for yourself to know what data it is about), indicate whether the data are newly generated/collected or reused,\ndigital or physical, also indicate the type of the data (the kind of content), its technical format (file extension), and an estimate of the upper limit of the volume of the data.\nDataset case study 1: observational.
