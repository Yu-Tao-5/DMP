Last modiﬁed 10 February 2025 4 of 9 KUL-IP&P: digital data: KUL-sharepoint for the specific research project, physical data: insect pilot plant and research labs, P- building, Campus Geel KUL-CABG: extracted DNA will be stored in the freezers (-20°C) of the CABG Bio Sample Database, if possible in different aliquots, stored over different freezers on different electric circuits. All data generated in the project will be stored on KU Leuven internal servers (J: (Shared) , K: (Archive) and L: (Large Volume Storage) drives). How will the data be How will the data be backed up backed up ? ? TM-EC SBC:Data will be backed up using cloud service offered by Thomas More (Microsoft 365: SharePoint/OneDrive/Teams). These cloud services take automatic backups. KUL-CABG: Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS. DNA samples: if possible, all samples will be aliquoted (2 or more aliquots) and divided over different freezers, all with temperature alarm signals. KUL-IP&P: Data will be backed up using cloud service offered by KU Leuven ICTS (Microsoft 365: SharePoint/OneDrive/Teams). These cloud services take automatic backups.

If no or insufficient storage during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes TM-EC SBC: Cloud service offered by Thomas More has 5 TB storage and backup capacity through the corporate Office 365 licence. This is sufficient for the data created during the project KUL-CABG: In the project budget, a part of the consumables is allocated to computing and data storage. The estimated volume we expect to generate in this project is within lines of the available space on the KU Leuven storage servers. If insufficient, additional server space will be acquired (funds from research group). KUL-IP&P: Cloud service offered by KU Leuven has 1 TB storage and backup capacity per team through the corporate Office 365 licence. This is sufficient for the data created during the project How will you ensure that the data are How will you ensure that the data are securely stored securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? TM EC SBC: Access to the data stored in the cloud service offered by Thomas More (corporate Office365 storage) is arranged via the Azure Active Directory and Multi Factor Authentication KUL-CABG: Access to the digital data is restricted to the team members of the research group CABG. DNA samples are stored in a locked (freezer) room with restricted access only to authorized members of the research group CABG. KUL-IP&P: Electronic data will be stored using a combination of Sharepoint and Teams-sites. Both of these methods are recommended as suitable for confidential data by the KU Leuven storage guide (https://icts.kuleuven.be/storagewijzer/en). Teams allows granting of individual access to users both inside and outside of KU Leuven, thus facilitating easy collaboration between the research consortium while maintaining security of data access. What are the What are the expected costs expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? TM-EC SBC: No extra costs are to be expected since the cloud service offered by Thomas More will be used. KUL-CABG:Server storage: for LVS € 95.14 / TB / year. Expected total (1TB): 100€/year. This was foreseen in the project budget. KUL-IP&P: No extra costs are to be expected since the cloud service offered by KU Leuven will be used. 4.
