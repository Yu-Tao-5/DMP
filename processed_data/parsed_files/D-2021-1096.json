Reassessing the History of the Senses, 1250 -1750  \n \nGrant Number    12ZY922N  \n \nHosting Institution   KU Leuven  \n \nProject Data Contact   Dr. Mattia Mantovani   \n \nSupervisor    Prof. Jan Papy  \n \nProject  Description  This project investigates the paradigm shift from truth to ecology that \noccurred in perception theories from 1250 to 1750 – in the period, \nnamely, from the adoption of an Aristotelian curriculum by European \nuniversities to the Encyclopédie . In the course o f the Early Modern age, I \nargue, the time -honoured Aristotelian claim that the senses provide \ninsight into the real properties of bodies was replaced by a quite \ndifferent understanding of sense -perception, as primarily aimed to \nsecure and foster the percei vers’ survival and well -being. Doing away \nwith the idea that the senses portray the world as it is, a growing number \nof early -modern thinkers tried to explain how the world of physics is \nadjusted and distorted in sense -perception so as to present perceiver s \nbelonging to different species with different habitats, according to their \ndifferent vital needs. The project investigates the manifold and \ncompeting reasons behind this shift in the understanding of sense -\nperception, locating its sources in late Scholas tic commentators and \nnovatores , in the newly -rediscovered ancient sceptical arguments and in \nDescartes’ philosophy. The projects further investigates the resistance \nthis shift of the senses from truth to ecology encountered, and the \nreasons for its final s uccess and diffusion well beyond philosophical \ncircles, as well as its far -reaching epistemological, metaphysical and \neven theological implications.  \n \n \n \n \n2 \n 2. Data Description  \n \nThe project deals with historical texts and images, in manuscript or printed  form, by consulting \nversions on paper, or accessible online via libraries websites and databases, and will result  in the \nproducing of journal articles (some of which with images reproductions), and of a final monograph. \nThe project is not aimed at the pr oduction o f new database(s).  \nThe project does not involve living beings, but only text and image material.  \n \nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make us e of existing data?  \n \n• Generate new data ; \n• Reuse existing data . \n \nDescribe the data types  the research will collect, generate and/or (re)use.  \n \n• Content : textual, visual (images, mostly etchings; no videos);  \n• Format : printed material, manuscripts, images, libraries  catalogues;  \n• Mode of data collection : no experiment, no observation, no simulation required;  \n• Digital  or non -digital : printed material, manuscripts, images, libraries catalogues;  \n• Raw  or processed : already -existing, processed catalogues.  \n \n \nDescribe in detail  the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume.  \n \nType of data Format  Volume  How created  \nImages and scans of \nprints  and manuscripts  pdf. max. 10GB Scanning from paper -based documents , \nretrieved through Google Books or  other \npublicly -accessible online libraries and  \narchives, or own reproductions of the \nmaterial.  \nTranscriptions and \ntranslations from the \nabove -mentioned data  docx.  max 1GB  Manuall y  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n 3. Legal and Ethical Issues  \n \nWill you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you  will use. Add the \nreference to your file in KU  Leuven's Register of Data  Processing for Research and Public Service \nPurposes (PRET application). Be  aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a \nlegal  obligation.  \nNo. \n \nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.  experiments on \nhumans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the  formal approval by the relevant \nethical review committee(s)  \nNo. \n \nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer  and valorisation ? \nWill IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so,  for what data and which restrictions \nwill be asserted?  \nNo. \n \nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the  data you (re)use? If \nso, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in  place?  \nSuch restriction s relate to  images , which I migh t – but not necessarily will  – want to reproduce in my \narticle. These images are normally subject to copyright.   \n \n \n4. Documentation and Metadata  \n \nWhat documentation will be provided to e nable reuse of the data collected/generated in this \nproject?  \nAll transcriptions and translations will be clearly labelled and potential use of images will be carried \nout only upon authorisation on the part of parties (libraries, archives, museums) that own the relevant \ncopyrights.  \n \nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used.  If no, state \nin detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse.  \nNo. \n \n5.

In case only \na selection of the data can/will  be preserved, clearly state  the reasons for this (legal or contractual \nrestrictions, physical preservation  issues, ...).  \nAll produced and collected data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after  the end of the \nproject in a safe, secure, and sustainable way.
