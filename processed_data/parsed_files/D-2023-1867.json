The F WO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official  start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO \nbut to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel.  Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.  \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation  Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives  of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions.  This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary  of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.  \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   2 \n 1.

Antibiotic therapy failure and the chronic nature of UTIs can be attributed to a \nsmall fraction of transiently non -growing, antib iotic -tolerant cells called persisters. An innovative method \nto cure chronic UTIs would be to induce growth resumption in UPEC persisters, thereby re -sensitizing \nthem to conventional antibiotics. However, our current understanding of persister recovery  is far from \ncomplete, hampering the development of anti -persister drugs. The aim of this project is to gain \nmechanistic insight in persister recovery  in UPEC. First, we will identify genetic factors contributing to \npersister recovery  in a high -throughput way by screening of pooled CRISPRi libraries containing thousands \nof cells that are each silencing a specific gene. Identified awakening determinants will be subjected to \nextensive functional and biochemical examination, which will contribute immensely to our understanding \nof persister recovery . Finally, we will develop  and implement cellular model systems for persistence to \nvalidate our findings in vivo. This project will lead to novel insights in persister recovery  and will pave the \nway for the developmen t of diagnostic tests for persistence as well as anti -persister drugs to effectively \nclear UTIs.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   4 \n 2.

    "clean_full_text": "FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 1 FWO DMP Template - Flemish Standard Data Management Plan Project supervisors (from application round 2018 onwards) and fellows (from application round 2020 onwards) will, upon being awarded their project or fellowship, be invited to develop their answers to the data management related questions into a DMP. The F WO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.

Antibiotic therapy failure and the chronic nature of UTIs can be attributed to a small fraction of transiently non -growing, antib iotic -tolerant cells called persisters. An innovative method to cure chronic UTIs would be to induce growth resumption in UPEC persisters, thereby re -sensitizing them to conventional antibiotics. However, our current understanding of persister recovery is far from complete, hampering the development of anti -persister drugs. The aim of this project is to gain mechanistic insight in persister recovery in UPEC. First, we will identify genetic factors contributing to persister recovery in a high -throughput way by screening of pooled CRISPRi libraries containing thousands of cells that are each silencing a specific gene. Identified awakening determinants will be subjected to extensive functional and biochemical examination, which will contribute immensely to our understanding of persister recovery . Finally, we will develop and implement cellular model systems for persistence to validate our findings in vivo. This project will lead to novel insights in persister recovery and will pave the way for the developmen t of diagnostic tests for persistence as well as anti -persister drugs to effectively clear UTIs.
