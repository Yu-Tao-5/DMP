Extension of the soft switching\nregions, reduction in the effective currents under wide voltage operation, and quasi-fixed frequency operation have been accomplished. Nevertheless,\npower density is still one of the main pitfalls to overcome in order to take the technology to valorisation. It was already proven that Controllable\nTransformers could increase the efficiency of isolated power converters for battery charging, which has big potential for the industry. The CONTRA\nproject aims to increase the power density of transformers in onboard chargers by employing planar controllable magnetic components and proving\nthem effective in power converters. The project proposes using DAB and LLC converters with a planar Controllable Transformer implementation,\npossibly nanocrystalline materials, to reduce stray inductance and increase voltage gain power levels. In this way, CONTRA can take this technology\nto the level of valorisation and exploitation.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n31-05-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
