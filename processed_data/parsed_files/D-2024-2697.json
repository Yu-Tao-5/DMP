Accordingly,\nAristotle argues that all natural bodies have certain natural changes. The proposed project studies Aristotle’s discussions on the primary natural change\nof simple bodies – the natural locomotion of the elements – in \nPhysics\n, \nDe Caelo\n, and other relevant passages. The project will answer what common\nand special characteristics these motions have, how Aristotle explains them in different contexts, and whether his discussions in different works\nconstitute a coherent theory of natural elemental motion. While certain problems involved in this issue have been long-discussed by scholars, the\nexisting studies are insufficient in offering a comprehensive picture of the theory. The project mainly consists of three parts. The first part constructs\nAristotle’s general theory of natural motion by analyzing a set of central principles and clarifying the key notions he uses for the discussion. The\nsecond and third parts study the natural motions of the terrestrial and celestial elements. The project will examine the interpretations from ancient\ncommentators (such as Simplicius and Philoponus) and will take the new developments in this field in the last decades into account.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n27-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
