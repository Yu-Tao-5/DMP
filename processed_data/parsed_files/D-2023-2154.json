The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning.

The sole disease-modifying drug  \nis the vasopressin (AVP) receptor 2 antagonist tolvaptan, but its limited therapeutic effect and significant  \nside effects warrant novel drugs. The antidiuretic effect of AVP is counteracted by apelin. Together with  \napela and the apelin receptor (APLNR), it forms the apelinergic system (AS). Although the AVP system has  \nbeen extensively studied in ADPKD, and despite its potential as a new treatment target in kidney and  \ncardiovascular diseases, the AS remains to be explored in ADPKD. Our preliminary research shows that the  \nAS is altered in ADPKD. Although apelin expression is reduced in the hypothalamus, apelin and APLNR  \nexpression is enhanced locally in kidney cells of ADPKD research models. Moreover, we found that patients  \nwith normal kidney function have increased circulating apelin. We therefore hypothesize that altered AS  \nfunction influences the cellular and molecular ADPKD phenotype. Therefore, we will investigate in depth the  \ndynamics, mechanisms and contribution of the AS in cyst formation and its interaction with the AVP system  \nin patients and in several ADPKD models (unique patient-derived kidney cell and mouse model). We aim to  \ngain crucial knowledge on kidney AS physiology, the role of the AS in ADPKD pathophysiology and its  \ntherapeutic potential in ADPKD.\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3.Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .Experimental (meta)data is described in electronic lab notebook of the PKD Research group (eLabFTW). Anonymized information on biobank samples are currently stored in a database in a shared password-protected folder. Cell line information will be stored in the registry for the KU Leuven central cryofacility (currently this information is still in a private database in a shared password-protected folder of the PKD Research group (incl. large volume storage)). Anonymized data will also be submitted to the KU Leuven Research Data Repository (RDR). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.

STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: -Leuven ADPKD biobank: gender, age, age at diagnosis, methods of diagnosis (imaging, genetics, etc.), reason of diagnosis (screening, symptoms, incidental finding) and clinical and therapeutic characteristics of ADPKD children (hypertension, proteinuria, etc.), genotype -Cell lines: age and gender of patient at time of sample collection, genotype 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data.☒ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☒ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☐ Other: Electronic notebook, Registry of central cryofacility, registry of central biobank, Research data repository of KU Leuven, External hard drive of PKD Research Group FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10How will the data be backed up?

If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data Password-protected folders, only accessible to designated members of the PKD Research group. These folders are maintained by the central ICT team of KU Leuven. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Research data repository allows 50GB/year storage per user. Additional storage requires a cost. Large volume storage (5TB) of KU Leuven involves a cost of 569.2 euro per year. Costs will be covered by other grant budgets that also make use of these data storage. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☒ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☒ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): External hard disk of PKD Research group What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period?
