Therefore, there will be restrictions for data disclosure as it may contain IP-sensitive information. All data will be subjected for their patentability prior to any publication. If applicable, patent applications will be filled. IP management will be conducted as described in the collaboration agreement SWOK: Patent applications will be made for relevant innovative procedures/products and the costs will be shared according to ownership percentage that shall be subject to negotiation on a pro rata basis. The IP can be filled by one partner on exclusive project results or by multiple partners to protect common project results (joined IP). Following the SWOK, the intention to file a patent application should be reported to the consortium at least two weeks prior to the filing date. Furthermore, to avoid publication of IPR sensitive results, all partners will be responsible for transfer of anticipated publications.

If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. Yes For this FWO project a research collaboration agreement is drawn up (i.e. SWOK). Furthermore, material product samples will be transferred between partners. Common project results and data will be shared in (bilateral) technical meetings (.pdf). Future (joined) anticipated publications or patent applications will be discussed in consortium meetings. The agreements concerning IPR are, briefly, reported in the previous question and described in the SWOK. In addition, dissemination of data and related experiments with material obtained from industrial partners, are subjected to the agreements that are made bilaterally between project partners and the industrial partners. These are defined in the SWOK and additional documents (e.g., MTA or NDA) signed by both parties. Examples of these are, but not limited to, enzymes provided by Metgen and catalysts provided by Johnson Matthey. For all base strains used in this project, Verstrepen lab will check, together with René Custers (Regulatory & Responsible Research Manager at VIB) whether we need to comply with the Nagoya protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization. In case we need to comply, we will meet certain diligence obligations under EU Regulation (EU) No 511/2014 (apply for ‘Prior Informed Consent’ document and negotiate ‘Mutually Agreed Terms” with Competent National Authority of the provider country).

The project coordinator (CSCE) has established a shared folder in the Teams application. This folder contains an overview table that needs to be completed for each sample shared among partners to maintain clarity, along with a brief description. Specific numbers will be assigned to each sample shared, which will be used as references in future discussions. At the Verstrepen lab (KU Leuven - VIB), data (digital files) generated in this project will be stored in a Dropbox Business Advanced account for processing and analyses; following secure data transfer, modern data encryption standards, and encrypted block storage (256-bit AES and SSL/TLS encryption). For more details see: https://www.dropbox.com/business/trust. Additionally, project data and sequencing data will be backed up to KU Leuven servers. Digital data files will be accompanied with a read me text file that contains relevant metadata for understanding and re-use of data. All the relevant scripts driving the project will be stored on a secure Dropbox account. Scripts used for analysis will also be stored in Jupyter notebook (jupyter.org - an open source web application to store and share scripts), in github or in the GitLab service of KU Leuven. At BBEPP, batch records with standardized outline and formatting will be prepared and completed with description of novel process technologies and optimized conditions, including a sample plan, analytical procedures and non-conformities during trials. Analytical data of obtained product streams from HPLC analysis will be stored as data files obtained directly from the Chemstation software (version C.01.05). SusMat (KU Leuven): all experimental notes are stored in an on-site electronic lab notebook server. Data is linked through a serial number to the appropriate experimental notes. Additional metadata is extracted from data files on a per technique basis and added to the ManGO (storage platform) metadata catalogue to increase findability. The technique and project identifier are also added to all data during upload in order to increase findability. At the Voet LAb (KUL LBMD) all data is double backed up in sinology NAS storage with 132TB capacity during the duration of the project and linked to benchling notebooks. All folders have README files to link files to the digital labbook. CSV files link the physical sample locations with the digital information.

Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. The experimental and analytical data will be stored in a restricted access repository. This data and insights will be, later, made available via publications or patents, which are accessible via LIMO (KU Leuven) and search engines like patentscope. More detailed information and data can be shared upon request by mail (corresponding author). For KU Leuven, data related to published manuscripts will be published in RDR (subject to restriction due to IP). As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org). Sharing policies for specific research outputs are detailed below: Biological data: Bacteria and yeast strains will be shared upon simple request following publication, unless we identify valuable IP. In this case, we will first protect commercial exploitation, either through patenting or via an MTA that restricts the material from commercial use. Plasmids will be made available via Addgene (non- profit plasmid repository), unless we identify valuable IP. Datasets will be deposited in open access repositories. Research documentation: All protocols used to generate published data will be described in the corresponding manuscript(s), and the related documentation will be included as supplementary information. These data and all other documents deposited in lab notebook are accessible to the PI and the research staff involved in the project, and will be made available upon request. Manuscripts: We opt for open access publications where possible. Publications will be automatically listed in our institutional repository, Lirias 2.0, based on the authors name and ORCID ID. Nucleic acid and protein sequences: Upon publication, all sequences supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via repositories such as the GenBank database or the European Nucleotide Archive (nucleotide sequences from primers / new genes / new genomes), NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (microarray data / RNA-seq data / CHIPseq data), the Protein Database (for protein sequences). The PDB database will be used to deposit the experimental crystal structures. Designed models with substrates will be deposited online in a Github account to gether with the scripts which yielded the structures. When will the data be made available?
