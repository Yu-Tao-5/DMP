Where will the data be stored? During the project, I will use the range of storage solutions provided by KU Leuven for the digital data gathered: a KUL-managed computer (password protected), laptop file storage, secure KUL network drives (I-/J-drive). How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution.

If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.

How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? 2 factor authentification S1A and S1B: Storage at the One drive cloud service provided by the Faculty of Arts (2 TB storage free of charge). This storage space is safe and automatically backed-up, and allows for extra protection of sensitive data, such as Multi Factor Authentication and Conditional Access functions, so that the historical researcher alone can access the data before anonymisation. The data will be anonymised with Cubase, distorting the voice and bleeping any identifiable information. As soon after collecting the data on the laptop file storage, the data will be stored on secure KU Leuven drives (I-/J-drive), which are incorporated within the secured KU Leuven environment, password-protected (including smartphone-based multi-factor identification) and only accessible by registered collaborating researchers. Only the PI can request access to the network drive for study personnel. The audio-files will be pseudonymized during transcription, the audio recording with identifiable information (voice, names) will be destroyed after transcript validation.The transcriptions of the interviews will be pseudonymised by giving the research participants and their organizations fictive names and, if necessary, by not stating their precise professional titles or other information that could make them recognizable. This personal information will be removed from the data set and the 'key' will be stored separately in a password-protected file. No identifying information is accessible to third parties. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? No additional costs are expected, as the data size will not exceed what has been provided through KU Leuven's data storage services which are free to its employees. 4.
