Several of the main players leading this industrial revolution and exporting their know-how to other parts of the world are\nheadquartered close to Flanders: Innovafeed (Nesle, France), Agronutris (Rethel, France), Ynsect (Amiens, France), Protix (Bergen op\nZoom, The Netherlands). To date, these four companies have attracted an estimated €1.1 billion of investment capital, and their\nproduction capacity is growing rapidly. Flanders is strategically positioned to harness this emerging source of regionally produced\nbiomass, aligning with the objectives outlined in its \"Protein Strategy 2030\" aimed at enhancing the sustainability of its protein\nproduction system. To do this responsibly, a number of key societal concerns on insect well-being during industrial production and the\nsafety and added value of the end-products have to be addressed. This research initiative has three primary objectives: i) Explore if and\nhow stress in insects can be measured by monitoring insect metabolome and behavior to contribute to the development of science-\nbased guidelines to score insect welfare, ii) Fill research gaps on safety of pre-consumer organic waste streams containing microplastics\nand/or spore-forming food pathogens to enable safe use of insect feed substrates that do not compete with food or feed production, and\niii) Identify which bio-active insect fractions drive observed beneficial effects on gut health in farm animals and define how these effects\ncan be better conserved during processing. This proposal will be carried out by a consortium of the leading Flemish research groups in\nthe field of edible insects working together to resolve several urgent challenges for insect production and usage with direct relevance for\nmultiple potential users.\nID: \nID: \n211474\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-10-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n30-09-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n17-01-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Several of the main players leading this industrial revolution and exporting their know-how to other parts of the world are headquartered close to Flanders: Innovafeed (Nesle, France), Agronutris (Rethel, France), Ynsect (Amiens, France), Protix (Bergen op Zoom, The Netherlands). To date, these four companies have attracted an estimated €1.1 billion of investment capital, and their production capacity is growing rapidly. Flanders is strategically positioned to harness this emerging source of regionally produced biomass, aligning with the objectives outlined in its \"Protein Strategy 2030\" aimed at enhancing the sustainability of its protein production system. To do this responsibly, a number of key societal concerns on insect well-being during industrial production and the safety and added value of the end-products have to be addressed. This research initiative has three primary objectives: i) Explore if and how stress in insects can be measured by monitoring insect metabolome and behavior to contribute to the development of science- based guidelines to score insect welfare, ii) Fill research gaps on safety of pre-consumer organic waste streams containing microplastics and/or spore-forming food pathogens to enable safe use of insect feed substrates that do not compete with food or feed production, and iii) Identify which bio-active insect fractions drive observed beneficial effects on gut health in farm animals and define how these effects can be better conserved during processing. This proposal will be carried out by a consortium of the leading Flemish research groups in the field of edible insects working together to resolve several urgent challenges for insect production and usage with direct relevance for multiple potential users.
