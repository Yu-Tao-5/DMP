Yes When depositing data in a local or public repository, the final dataset will be accompanied with a README.txt file containing all the relevant information, following the Dublin Core Metadata standard. This file will be located in the top-level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used. This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3.

Experimental raw data (e.g. fluorescence read-outs, NMR data) are typically automatically saved to the local network by the software. All data will be stored on OneDrive for business (KU Leuven) and Syncthing will be used for additional back-ups and long-term storage. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Through OneDrive-client, automatic back-ups are made of local files to OneDrive. Syncthing is being used to create an automated backup service of local files (linked to OneDrive or additional local files when necessary) both onsite and offsite, relying on personal machines from Prof. Pinheiro. This creates redundancy with data stored in multiple secure locations. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.

If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes The expected data volume falls within the free data storage allocation. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? OneDrive for business is secured using the KU Leuven data security systems and authentication. Syncthing creates a peer-to-peer encrypted network that must be authorized by both machines via a randomly-generated 128-bit key. Both ends must authorize the sharing of a folder before syncthing will allow data transfer. The network itself was set up in the Pinheiro lab as a spoke and hub model, with the spoke (individual researchers) only able to deposit data into the hub (onsite). The hub is backed up to an offsite secure server. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?
