Preformed crystals of the desired\nchemical compound (seeds) are commonly added to a crystallizer. This drastically speeds up crystallization and ensures required critical product\nqualities. In seeded crystallizers, the two processes creating new crystalline material are (1) secondary nucleation and (2) crystal growth. Although\nboth occur simultaneously in real-life, research studies typically focus on only one of both.\nThis way, the role of crystal growth in the process of secondary nucleation is highly overlooked. In this project, we hypothesize that crystal growth\nplays a non-negligible role in the process of nuclei breeding, a mechanism significantly affecting the outcome of secondary nucleation. This will lead\nto fundamental insights into secondary nucleation, aiding in better control of industrial crystallization.\nThis project focuses on experimentally showing the hypothesized role of crystal growth in secondary nucleation using a novel flow crystallizer. As both\nprocesses take place in the crystal-solution boundary layer, we propose to investigate the nature of this boundary layer using Raman\nmicrospectroscopy. To provide more theoretical insight into the stability of the boundary layer and a possible nucleation pathway, a 2D-Ising model\nwill be developed.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n29-03-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Subsequently, the sample name (combined with the corresponding conditions and observations) is added and saved into an electronic list (.docx, .xlsx), which also contains a more detailed description of the followed experimental procedure. Raman spectroscopy: Raman spectroscopy: Spectra are received in .csv or .txt format and named “name_time_conditions”. Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) are followed to analyze the Raman spectra before plotting. The followed procedures and observations are written in a lab notebook and subsequently saved digitally (electronic list in .docx, .xlsx). Scanning electron microscopy: Scanning electron microscopy: Pictures are captured according SOPs and saved as .tiff files with the name “name_time_conditions”. The device settings are also automatically displayed in the saved pictures. Afterwards, samples cannot be stored. Light microscopy: Light microscopy: Pictures are taken and saved according to SOPs and saved as .tiff files with the name “name_time_conditions”. The pictures are saved together with their metadata following OME standard. Photos: Photos: Relevant photos of the setup, samples, observations etc. taken in the lab are saved in .jpeg, .png or .tiff format. Temperature profiles: Temperature profiles: Temperatures will be recorded using SE374 software. Data will be saved in .dat or .txt format. The name of the experiment is added and saved into an electronic list (.docx, .xlsx), which also contains a more detailed description of the followed experimental procedure. 3D printing: 3D printing: 3D models for setup construction are design in Solid Edge (.par) and saved digitally. After exporting the 3D model into an .stl file, the physical part is made by 3D printing. Both the .stl files as the physical part will be stored (either digitally or inside a setup). Ising model simulations: Ising model simulations: Computer simulations are conducted in Python. README.txt files will be made to accompany each source code file and will contain the simulations conditions, the followed procedures and observations. The source code files are saved as .py files while the output is provided as .gif or .txt files. All files will be stored on a private GitHub profile. Plots and graphs: Plots and graphs: Data from experiments or simulations are provided as .txt files that can be plotted using Gnuplot software. Both the code for plotting as the output will be saved digitally. The code for plotting is in .gnu format, while the output can be .eps, .png, .pdf, .tikz depending on the final application of the plot/graph. Images: Images: Images will be created using Paint.net and stored as .pdn files. The exported images will have the .eps, .png, .pdf, .tikz format depending on the final application. Notes: Notes: The physical lab notebook is used for setup design (sketches) and writing down of observations. When not used in the lab, the notebook will be stored in a locked drawer in the office. Important notes (samples names, conditions etc.: see above) are compiled into an electronic list (.docx or .xlsx). Manuscripts: Manuscripts: Communication of scientific results is done via manuscripts and saved in .docx, .pdf or .tex. Presentations: Presentations: Presentations containing scientific results are produced using PowerPoint and stored accordingly (.ppt or .pdf).

Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? All data will be stored on the work laptop of the researcher, on an external hard drive and in a shared cloud (OneDrive). After completion of (sub)WPs, the data will be additionally stored on the KUL service servers. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Data are backed up on the cloud (OneDrive) immediately. The software indicates the update status (green, blue or red) and, in case of a non- sync, action can be taken using the online version of the tool. Data are further back up regularly on an external hard drive. After completion of (sub)WPs, data will be additionally backed up on the KUL service servers. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Data storage should not exceed 1.5 TB. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Only authorized researchers have access to the OneDrive account: all users need to use a two-factor authentication to log in (MFA app from KUL). On lab computers, a log-out is always performed to prevent modification by unauthorized people. Hard drives and physical lab notebooks are stored in a closed drawer in the office. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project are around €5000. These costs will be covered by Prof. Simon Kuhn. 4.
