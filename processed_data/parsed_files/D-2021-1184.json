My research focuses on prosthetic memories of WWII in Post-Soviet\nsociety through cinema and proposes a novel theoretical and practical framework for researching\nprosthetic memory through first- person documentaries (films in which the filmmaker's\nparticipation has a significant dramaturgical role). \nThe goals of this project are: (1) To examine\nhow (prosthetic) 'memories' can be or have been formed, transmitted and reflected in non-fiction\ncinema. \n(2) To detect novel methodologies and practices which will be applied when making a\nfirst-person documentary on intergenerational trauma and prosthetic memory of WWII in\ncontemporary society. The film will deal with the legacy of WWII and Stalinism on three\nconsecutive generations of my family. \n(3) To create a theoretical and practical framework for\ncontemporary filmmakers working on intergenerational trauma and prosthetic memory of\nmilitary conflicts and their aftermath. \nThe project will result in a feature-length documentary film\nand in various articles, to be published in international, peer-review journals. These articles will\nform the backbone of my thesis. The film and the thesis will form a unity, as required by the\nregulations for a PhD in the Arts, as stipulated by the host institution.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
