Pascal Sienaert\nDescription\n Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an evidence-based treatment for difficult to\ntreat, severe and sometimes life-threatening depressive episodes. It involves passing an\nelectrical charge through the brain, via electrodes that are placed either on one side of the head\n(right unilateral RUL) or on both sides (bitemporal, BT), to induce a generalized seizure, under\nbrief anesthesia. \nAlthough results are conflicting, RUL ECT has been shown to be less effective\nthan BT ECT, and induces fewer cognitive side-effects, whereas BT ECT is considered to have a\nfaster antidepressant effect, but bears/entails a higher risk of cognitive side-effects. \nIn non-\nresponders, it is common practice to switch from RUL to BT electrode placement. However, no\nrandomized controlled trial (RCT) data are available to support this ubiquitous clinical practice.\nWe designed an RCT to address which treatment strategy (continue RUL ECT of switch to BT)\nspeeds up recovery and has the least impact on memory function. The answerable clinical\nquestion can be structured as follows: - Patient: Patients treated with ECT for depression,\nshowing no â€˜responseâ€™ (<50% decrease in depressive symptom severity compared to\nbaseline) after 4 treatment sessions; - Intervention: Switch to BT ECT; - Comparison: Continue\nwith RUL ECT; - Outcome: Depressive symptom severity and autobiographical memory (co-\nprimary outcomes) after 8 treatment sessions. This project addresses the clinical question ECT-\npractitioners are faced with in daily clinical practice, and for which there is no consistent\nempirical evidence available. Being the first-ever RCT on the switch from RUL ECT to BT ECT, this\nproject will have an important impact on the clinical practice, guiding clinical decision making.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
