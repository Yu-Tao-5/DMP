The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Silke Goubin 0000-0002-6264-6224\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Tine van Regenmortel (supervisor) (0000-0003-0233-6213)\nMarc Hooghe (co-supervisor) (0000-0002-7677-5094)\nAnna Ruelens (co-supervisor) (0000-0003-0539-4398)\nProject number 1 & title  12AZH24N Concerned about inequality?

Despite high and rising inequality, and its pressure on \nredistributive welfare states, there is no systematic evidence that inequality leads to redistributive policies  \nor public demands for such policies. We are confronted with a paradox: Most citizens and politicians \nrealise that inequality exists and is not desirable, yet little is done about it. Further, we lack clear \nknowledge about when and how citizens and politicians react to inequality between countries and over \ntime. In this project, I therefore examine the inequality concerns of citizens and political parties based on \nthree objectives. The project investigates (1) if (changes) in inequality levels shape citizens’ inequality \nperceptions and preferences over time, (2) when and how political parties discuss inequality, and its \nrepercussions for public opinion, and (3) the influence of inequality on citizens’ voting behaviour. To study \nthese objectives, I collect and analyse survey and experimental data on citizens’ inequality perceptions and  \npreferences, and party manifesto and social media data on political parties’ inequality concerns. By \nbuilding on insights from cleavage theory, and by using a variety of cutting-edge methods, this project \nsheds an original light on the interplay between citizens, political parties, and inequality across liberal \ndemocracies and over time.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data We will store the data on the KU Leuven network drive of HIVA. This J-drive is secured and automatically backed up. Onedrive documents will be shared only among the supervisors of the research project. In case documents are shared outside of the research project (e.g. within the research group) this will be done with restricted access (shared via e-mail) and editing rights (view-only).

How will these costs be covered?As we use the KU Leuven platforms and standard procedures, we do not foresee any additional costs 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?As we use the KU Leuven platforms and standard procedures, we do not foresee any additional costs FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 116. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY.

If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available?

If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED.

If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☒ No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? No expected costs 7. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project?Professor dr.
