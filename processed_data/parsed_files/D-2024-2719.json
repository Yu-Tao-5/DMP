Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). Physical data: A descriptive map indicating where each sample or material generated is stored will be maintained as a *.xlsx or *. docx file. Digital data: -Protocols/experimental and evaluation procedures will be clearly written and maintained in *.docx /*.pdf format. -Meaningful and descriptive data file names will be used: for raw data as well as analysed data. -Where in itial raw data is exported into a new format: reference to initial data (location) will be made. -Steps involved in data analysis and relevant analysis will be documented in *.docx file. -For published material, a metadata will be available: with folders s howing the published material, associated processed and raw data files (see below). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 7 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☒ Yes ☐ No For each published article, a metadata will be created to ease data retrieval and reuse. This metadata will be based on the Dublin core metadata standard. The metadata will be named based on the title of article, authors, year of publication. Files ass ociated with the metadata will include: -The accepted version of the article as available in KU Leuven, Lirias: *.pdf file. -The published article as available online in the peer reviewed journal: *.pdf file; wherein doi -number, journal of publication and abstract, etc can be found. -The peer review history of the article; comments from reviewers, rebuttal to the reviewers: *. pdf file/*.docx. -An excel sheet of the data used to generate the graphs and tables presented in the published article: *.xlsx. A folder (only for internal use) with all excel sheets (*.xlsx) related to the final graphs in the article: therein, the raw dat a (including the equipment used, location of the raw/equipment generated data) will be referenced. The metadata and the referenced files will be stored on the Archive/‘K:’ network drive FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 8 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Physical data: Most raw materials and samples generated during experiments do not need long -term storage, with the exception of the dried samples and the refrigerated and frozen samples for use in the third work package . These samples will be stored in the cold room (4 °C) and in freezers (-40°C ). Dried samples will be stored in desiccators until the associated data has been published or until the end of the project (end of the PhD). Digital data: Data will be stored on KU Leuven network drives: - Personal/‘I:’ network drive or OneDrive for Business storage (2 TB available to every PhD researcher – not for strictly confidential or personal data ) for daily personal use and data storage. - Archive/‘K:’ network drive will be used fo r storage of published data. Data which was stored on the I: network drive and OneDrive storage will be transferred to K: network drive when personnel is leaving the research unit. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS , STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON -DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH .6 REFER TO INSTITUTION -SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PRO CEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE . The network drives are automatically backed -up by IT, KU Leuven: https://icts.kuleuven.be/sc/english/storage/desktop -file-storage . OneDrive for Business data is stored in the cloud in which version history (up to 100 versions per file) is enabled: https://icts.kuleuven.be/sc/english/storage/onedrive . 6 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9 Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No - 50 GB of Personal/‘I:’ data storage for every researcher is available in our research unit. In addition, 2 TB of OneDrive for Business storage space is available for free to every PhD researcher. - 1.3 TB of long -term data storage is availab le on the Archive/‘K:’ network drive folders of the research unit. If necessary, more storage space will be acquired from the university, with the cost being covered by the research unit/the project budget. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 6 - Data stored on the Personal/‘I:’ network drive is only accessible to a specific researcher. This data is automatic ally backed up by ICT, KU Leuven. Access to KU Leuven network drives is automatically secured by multifactor authentication . - Data stored on OneDrive for Business is only accessible to a specific researcher. Version history (up to 100 versions per file) i s enabled. Multifactor authentication can be activated as additional security measure. OneDrive for Business will not be used for strictly confidential or personal data. - Final data files can also be stored on the Archive/‘K:’ network drive , which has restricted access (only professors and postdocs of the research group) . - Storage of personal data and corresponding coding will be restricted to the Personal/‘I:’ network drive of the person(s) dedicated to that work package or on the Archive/‘K:’ ne twork drive which has restricted access (only professors and postdocs of the research group). Access to KU Leuven network drives is automatically secured by multifactor authentication. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the re search project? How will these costs be covered? Storage capacity (on the Archive/‘K:’ network drive) can be increased for an annual fee of 100.86 Euro/TB. This data is automatically backed up by ICT, KU Leuven. Buying additional storage capacity can be co vered by the consumables budget of the project. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). - Only physical samples that are difficult to regenerate will be reta ined after the end of the project. - All digital data will be retained for more than the expected 5 -year period, on the Archive/‘K:’ drive. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? The data will be copied to the Archive/‘K:’ network drive (with automatic back -up procedures) and stored for at least 5 years. To date, 1.3 TB storage is available, however if needed, additional data space can be obtained. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Annual fee of 100.86 Euro/TB. The research unit/project consumables budget will be used to cover this cost. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11 6.
