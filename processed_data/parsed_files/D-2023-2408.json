Vanilla is a high value tropical cash crop and a globally very important spice used in a broad spectrum of food products. Future\nvanilla bean supply is, however, at risk due to the combined effect of a genetically eroded crop species with an over-intensified farming system. The\nnegative effects associated with low genetic diversity are expected to exacerbate under climate change. As a consequence, there is an urgent need to\nenhance vanilla production resilience through diversification at both crop and system level. Despite the promising role of the wild relatives of the crop\nspecies \nVanilla planifolia\n, an in-depth evaluation to integrate these so-called crop wild relatives (CWR) into breeding programs with improved plant\nperformance under climate change, is currently lacking. Our project therefore seeks to guide the development of a climate-smart vanilla production\nstrategy that involves novel \nVanilla \ngenetics. We will apply an innovative, interdisciplinary approach that combines state-of-the-art techniques within\nthe field of species distribution modelling and populations genetics, plant phenotyping, and participatory stakeholder assessments. The obtained\ninsights will ultimately lead to the formulation of an action plan in close collaboration with key stakeholders along the chain of custody.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n03-01-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
