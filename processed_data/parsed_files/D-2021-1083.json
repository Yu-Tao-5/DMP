Tissue loading and unloading cycles represent mechanical stimuli\nessential for the cells to maintain cartilage integrity by mechanotransduction. However, in early\nstages of OA this protective effect of physiological loading appears compromised, and\nchondrocytes shift their anabolism-catabolism balance. The mechanisms underlying this impaired\nresponse to loading remain elusive, hampering the development of strategies that delay or\nreverse disease progression. In this FWO project I will address a fundamental knowledge gap:\nwhy is the protective effect of loading compromised in early OA? I hypothesize that the\nprotective response to loading depends on the chondrocytes mechanical memory, which is\ninadequately tuned in the altered mechanical environment of early OA, yet can be retrained\nthrough optimizing mechanotransduction pathways. To test this hypothesis, I will outline the\nmechanisms of mechanical memory in chondrocytes, elucidate the impact of mechanical\nenvironment in the early OA and test the potential of biomechanical modulation of these\nparameters as a therapy to withstand the phenotypic molecular shift of early OA chondrocytes. If\nsuccessful, the mechano-biological optimization of cartilage homeostasis could be a game-\nchanger for treatment of OA.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
