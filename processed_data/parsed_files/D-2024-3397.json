I \npropose to generate a single-cell multi-omics atlas, combining scRNA-seq\nand scATAC-seq, across the f\nruit fly Drosophila melanogaster from embryo to larvae, to pupae, to adult. (1) So far, I covered the \nwhole\nlarval development in chromatin accessibility and continue with the pupal development, both \nin closely set time windows. I annotate the\nscATAC-seq atlas using bridge integration with the \npreviously published Fly Cell Atlas and developmental tissues. (2) My multi-ome atlas\nwill be used to \ninfer gene regulatory networks at the whole-organism level focusing on cell type identity and \nfunction in development.\nAlong inferred trajectories, I will study transcription factor (TF) and \nenhancer pleiotropy; I will determine the optimal combinations of TFs\nper cell type; and I will study \nnetwork motifs (e.g., feedback and feedforward loops) and gene repression. (3) Importantly, I will \ncombine\nthe computational predictions with genetic experiments in an iterative fashion, leading to \nnew biological insight and better computational\nmodels. For the in vivo validations, I will take \nadvantage of the advanced fly genetics toolbox. This will include the generation of\ntransgenic flies for \nsynthetic enhancer design and the use of single-cell high-throughput TF-binding assays adapted for \nDrosophila.\nID: \nID: \n211158\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-11-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n31-10-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n21-11-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
