Data will be stored on GitHub and or KU Leuven OneDrive, which provide back-up procedures. Describe the data security procedures and who has access to the data. Data will be private and only accessible by authorized users added to the project repositories. Reading and editing for OneDrive and GitHub permissions will be granted to the PIs and research of the two participating research groups. 5. Data selection and Preservation after Research What is the long-term preservation plan for these dataset(s)? The data will remain available on GitHub and/or KU Leuven OneDrive for authorized users and when necessary stored on the university's central servers for at least 10 years at the end of the project. Data Selection: Which data will have long time value for the research and will be preserved? Long time valuable and relevant data will likely be reported and summarized in publications and publically available. 6. Data Sharing Are there any restrictions for sharing the data?
