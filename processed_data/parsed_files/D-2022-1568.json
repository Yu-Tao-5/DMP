The project comprises 3 placebo-controlled clinical trials (CT)\nand aims to investigate the potential of intermittent exogenous ketosis (IEK) as a novel strategy\nto improve hypoxic tolerance and adaptation in healthy volunteers. In CT1, we ingestigate the\nacute effects of \nIEK during exercise. In CT2, we study the acute effects of IEK on sleep quality in\nhypoxia following strenuous exercise. In CT3 we scrutinize functional and physiological\nadaptations as well as acute mountain sickness development during 10 days of hypoxic\nresidence. These data are acquired to investigate the intended research questions and to allow\npublication in high-impact journals.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
