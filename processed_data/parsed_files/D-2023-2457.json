GENERAL INFORMATION\nName of the project lead (PI)\nJeffrey Prinzie\nInternal Funds Project number & title\nC3/23/014\n2. DATA DESCRIPTION\n2.1. Will you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?  \nWe will generate/collect new data. We will not make use of existing data.\n2.2. What data will you collect, generate or reuse? Describe the origin, type and format of the data \n(per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a numbered list or table and per \nobjective of the project.\nData type Description Format Volume\nElectronic design \ndatabaseDesign database of \nintegrated circuits: \nschematics, layout, \nsimulation resultsCadence OA proprietary \nformat50-100GB\nElectronic \nmeasurementsMeasurement data acquired \nduring electronic tests in labFormat varies depending  \non equipment.

See data \nstorage on how we 5-10TB\n2manage this\nReports Design/development reports  \nand test repotsPDF <1GB\n3. ETHICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES\n3.1. Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add \nthe reference to the file in KU Leuven's Record of Processing Activities. Be aware that registering \nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNo\n3.2. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments \non humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant \nethical review committee(s).\nNo\n3.3. Does your research possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and \nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and \nwhich restrictions will be asserted?\nYes, restrictions will be asserted for the design database.\n3.4. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you \n(re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions regarding reuse and sharing are in \nplace?\nNo\n4. DOCUMENTATION AND METADATA\n4.1. What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of the data \ncollected/generated in this project?  \nData type Metadata\nElectronic design \ndatabaseDesigns are documented following our own internal data \nmanagement plan: https://iiw.kuleuven.be/onderzoek/advise/dmp\nElectronic \nmeasurementsRaw data is accompagnied with a description file that contains the \nconditions, setup of the acquired results. An exexutable is stored \nalong the data to reproduce the results as well as a manual how to \nreproduce the analysis.\nIrradiation results Same as “Electronic Measurements”\nReports Reports are stored per date and milestone\n4.2. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used. If not, \nstate in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\n35. DATA STORAGE AND BACKUP DURING THE PROJECT\n5.1. Where will the data be stored?  \nData type storage\nElectronic design \ndatabaseLinux storage provided by ESAT (dept. Electrical Engineering). \nDesigns are synced to a github repository.\nElectronic \nmeasurementsSame as Electronic design database\nIrradiation results Same as Electronic design database\nReports Project one-drive\n5.2. How will the data be backed up?  \nData type storage\nElectronic design \ndatabaseLinux storage provided by ESAT (dept.

Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.  \nYes, ESAT provides storage capability in the department datacenter.\n5.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How will these \ncosts be covered? \nCost is included in the “computer infrastructure” of the proposal and is part of an annual user account fee \nto ESAT.\n5.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or \nmodified by unauthorized persons?  \nESAT provides secure access to a by-user storage.\n6. DATA PRESERVATION AFTER THE END OF THE PROJECT\n6.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the project? If only  \na selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is the case (legal or contractual  \nrestrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll data.\n46.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)?  \nBackup provided by ESAT.\n6.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How will the costs \nbe covered? \nCosts are part of the user account fees.\n7. DATA SHARING AND RE-USE\n7.1. Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as \ndefined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions or because of IP potential)?  \nNo data will be made available because of IP potential.\n7.2. Which data will be made available after the end of the project?  \nNone – only upon request and via contractual agreement.\n7.3. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse?  \nNA\n7.4. When will the data be made available?  \nNA\n7.5. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions?  \nNA\n7.6. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?  \nNA\n8. RESPONSIBILITIES\n8.1. Who will be responsible for the data documentation & metadata?  \nJeffrey Prinzie\n8.2. Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?  \nDepartment of Electrical Engineering – Jeffrey Prinzie\n8.3. Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and sharing?  \nJeffrey Prinzie\n8.4. Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?  \n5Jeffrey Prinzie"
