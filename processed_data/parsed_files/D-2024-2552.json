Starting with Gennadius' only complete exegetical  \nwork, a recently discovered Commentary on Hosea, my research will shed light on Gennadius' entire oeuvre. My analysis of  \nthe Commentary on Hosea will put into perspective the preserved fragments of his other texts: I will study Gennadius' skill as  \nan exegete, the doctrinal and theological implications of his Biblical interpretations, his relationship with his predecessors who  \nalso commented on the Book of Hosea, and the posterity of his work in exegetical compilations produced later, known as  \ncatenae. My research will thus restore Gennadius’s status as an important Biblical exegete in the history of the Church and will  \ndefine more precisely the theological positions he adopts. More broadly, my work will enable a greater understanding of  \nBiblical reception in the patristic period and the intellectual milieu in which it was practised during the pivotal period of late  \nantiquity.\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.
