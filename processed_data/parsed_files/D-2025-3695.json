The ‘free hormone hypothesis’ suggests that this free fraction is mainly responsible for biological activity.\nThough experimental and clinical data support this, routinely available methods measure total hormone levels, which could lead to\nincorrect diagnosis and treatment, especially in conditions with altered binding protein production (e.g. obesity, pregnancy). Direct free\nhormone measurements are not available in clinical routine. With CLASH-free, we aim to improve the clinical applicability of free steroid\nhormones by using state-of-the-art methods. We will develop methods for direct free steroid hormone measurements. We will investigate\nhow changes in binding proteins affect total and free hormone levels.
