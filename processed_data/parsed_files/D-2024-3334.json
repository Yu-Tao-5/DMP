Yes, animal data Task 4.2: I will validate the therapeutic L. lactis strain in a preclinical model of BRCA1-mutant TNBC development. To mimic TNBC development, human BRCA1-mutant cells derived from TNBC will be intraductally injected into the mammary glands of immunocompromised female recipient mice (n = 4 injected glands per mouse, 3 replicates with 2 different TNBC lines and 2 control lines). Mutant cells will engraft within the ductal network of the mammary gland and form pre-invasive fields of mutant cells representing pre-invasive lesion development, followed by invasive transformation later. Upon establishment of mutant fields of cells (2-3 months after injection) therapeutic L. lactis bacteria will be injected intraductally and mammary glands will be harvested 1, 2, 4, and 6 months after injection.

Raw data will be collected per test, including a .txt file with a clear description of what the data represents and how they were generated. An inventory of all data and a description will be collected in an Excel file. All work performed in the lab will be saved as an Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN). This notebook will contain all information on methodology, protocols, results and conclusions. The ELN will be ordered chronologically, with a title for every date and a subtitle for every experiment. Every month, a time-stamped pdf copy of the ELN of that month will be made and stored on the KU Leuven servers. General protocols and standard operating procedures will be collected in a dedicated folder on a Shared network drive (J:) at KU Leuven. Raw LC-MS, HPLC and NMR data will be collected alongside a .txt file (README file) with a description of the experimental conditions. All the images with their explanation will be saved in the ELN. Additionally, the images will be saved in separate folders. The name of this folder consists of the date and the title of the experiment. Various tools will be used to process data (e.g. SnapGene for sequencing data ...). The input files (raw data) will be kept in the same folder as the processed files. The name of the folder will contain the date and information about the experiment. Background information will be stored in an Excel file and the Electronic Lab Notebook.

All data will be transcribed into digital format and will be stored in an online lab management system with an integrated Electronic Lab Notebook together with accompanying information. This Electronic Lab Notebook (monthly time-stamped copies) and digital data (e.g. images, spectroscopic data, sequencing data, metadata ...) will be stored in a personal folder on a Shared network drive (J:) which is backed up by the ICTS service of the KU Leuven. Additional copies will be made and kept on personal devices. Once a researcher leaves the lab, their data will be transferred to a large-volume network archive drive. Besides, the LC-MS data will be stored in duplicate on dedicated external hard drives. Bacteria and DNA will be stored in duplicate in -80 and -20°C freezers, respectively. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? The data will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic daily back-up procedures.
