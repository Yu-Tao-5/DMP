Educational\nscientists study attention via post-hoc assessments (self- reports or cognitive tests), yet these are inaccurate and do not\ncapture fluctuations in attention over time. On the other hand, biomedical engineers have recently made progress in\nobjectively tracking attention to auditory stimuli via brain recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG), but these\nmethods are not yet adapted to the complexity of the classroom context. We propose a strong interdisciplinary\ncollaboration between biomedical engineers and educational neuroscientists, to develop novel EEG-based markers of\nauditory attention during learning. This will lead to new data-driven EEG-based algorithmic tools that quantify attention\nover time, both in groups and individuals. These tools will be used to identify student profiles and to investigate the\neffects of (neurofeedback) interventions.\nLast modified: \n18-10-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
