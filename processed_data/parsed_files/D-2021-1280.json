The goal is to study the impact\nof micro and nano structures as textured surfaces on heat transfer enhancement during flow\nboiling. In this regard, studying the basic mechanisms taking place at the small scale would allow\nto define optimized textures for specific applications and thus increasing efficiency and reducing\ncost. The data collected here are visualisations of the flow/bubble growth/detachment frequency\netc on the one hand and visualisations of a new temperature measuring technique (Quantum\nDots) serving as a high resolution, fast response method. The end goal is thus to be able to link\nthe geometric parameters to the heat transfer enhancement and create models that can be used\nin the future.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
