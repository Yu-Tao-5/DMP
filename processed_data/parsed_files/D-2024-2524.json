One of the prominent ways to\nremove antibiotics is through advanced oxidation processes that are primarily performed in batch reactors. Batch reactors suffer from poor mass and\nphoton transfer, which is especially problematic for photocatalytic oxidation processes as this strongly limits the efficacy of the process. Transitioning\nto continuous processes in microreactors will overcome these limitations and provide a fundamental framework for the degradation kinetics of\nantibiotics.\nThis project introduces visible-light active and magnetic geopolymers from industrial waste for degrading antibiotics in a three-phase flow in a\ncontinuous photo-microreactor. The magnetic separability and photocatalytic activity of waste red mud-based geopolymers are first provided by using\ncommercial chemicals. They are then used to identify the optimum reaction conditions and characterize the flow hydrodynamics. Subsequently, their\napplication to different antibiotics and real wastewater is studied, and corresponding kinetic analyses are made. Lastly, their entirely red mud-based\ncounterpart is synthesized to determine its performance for the photodegradation of antibiotics. By combining the merits of microfluidics and the\nphotocatalytic oxidation processes, this project provides a sustainable direction for using waste based materials in multiphase systems for wastewater\ntreatment.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n29-03-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

One of the prominent ways to remove antibiotics is through advanced oxidation processes that are primarily performed in batch reactors. Batch reactors suffer from poor mass and photon transfer, which is especially problematic for photocatalytic oxidation processes as this strongly limits the efficacy of the process.

The magnetic separability and photocatalytic activity of waste red mud-based geopolymers are first provided by using commercial chemicals. They are then used to identify the optimum reaction conditions and characterize the flow hydrodynamics. Subsequently, their application to different antibiotics and real wastewater is studied, and corresponding kinetic analyses are made. Lastly, their entirely red mud-based counterpart is synthesized to determine its performance for the photodegradation of antibiotics. By combining the merits of microfluidics and the photocatalytic oxidation processes, this project provides a sustainable direction for using waste based materials in multiphase systems for wastewater treatment.
