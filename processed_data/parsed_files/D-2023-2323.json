The objective is to identify in the archaeological assemblages what could characterize the regional patterns of two\npharaonic communities. This will be addressed through study of the material culture and funerary practices of these two sites, which functioned during\nthe Old Kingdom, First Intermediate Period, early Middle Kingdom in two different regions of the Nile Valley. A very important source will be\nunpublished archival data of the early excavations. This will be integrated with the results of the excavations of KULeuven at the sites. For the\ninterpretation, an innovative combination of GIS analysis, material network analysis, and radiocarbon dating (exceptional in Egypt) will be deployed. A\nlong-term aim is to establish a research consortium developing this approach across the Nile Valley in the framework of an ERC project. \nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n15-03-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
