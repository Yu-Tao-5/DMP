However,  recent \noutbreaks  in powders  have evidenced  that pathogens  can survive  in powders,  evidencing  the need  for pasteurization  treatments.  Conventional  (thermal) \ntreatments  negatively  affect  product  quality,  forming  an issue  for consumer  acceptance.  Therefore,  nonthermal  and mild heat processing  technologies \nhave  emerged  as an alternative  to conventional  heat treatments.  Radio  Frequency  (RF)  and Nonthermal  Plasma  (NTP)  can improve  powders \npasteurization  while  maintaining  quality.  Nevertheless,  since  both individual  technologies  fail to acquire  the necessary  quality  and safety,  (RF, NTP) \nhurdle  technologies  are a promising  alternative,  although  limited  research  has been  conducted  on this topic.  The aim of this project  is to develop \nefficient  (RF, NTP)  pasteurization  processes,  focusing  on the best safety -quality  relation.  As a case study,  milk and paprika  powders  are selected, \ntogether  with Listeria  monocytogenes , Salmonella  Typhimurium  and Bacillus  cereus  spores  as target  microorganisms.  First,  individual  RF and NTP \ntreatments  will be optimized  for powder  treatment,  with regard  to RF frequency  and NTP gas, respectively.  Then,  inactivation  mechanisms  of the \nindividual  technologies  will be characterized.  Finally,  the knowledge  on the inactivation  mechanisms  will be used to design  optimal  (RF, NTP)  hurdle \ntechnology powder treatment strategies.  \n \nLast modified:  25-04-2024 \nCreated  using  DMPonline.be.

However, recent outbreaks in powders have evidenced that pathogens can survive in powders, evidencing the need for pasteurization treatments. Conventional (thermal) treatments negatively affect product quality, forming an issue for consumer acceptance. Therefore, nonthermal and mild heat processing technologies have emerged as an alternative to conventional heat treatments. Radio Frequency (RF) and Nonthermal Plasma (NTP) can improve powders pasteurization while maintaining quality. Nevertheless, since both individual technologies fail to acquire the necessary quality and safety, (RF, NTP) hurdle technologies are a promising alternative, although limited research has been conducted on this topic. The aim of this project is to develop efficient (RF, NTP) pasteurization processes, focusing on the best safety -quality relation. As a case study, milk and paprika powders are selected, together with Listeria monocytogenes , Salmonella Typhimurium and Bacillus cereus spores as target microorganisms. First, individual RF and NTP treatments will be optimized for powder treatment, with regard to RF frequency and NTP gas, respectively. Then, inactivation mechanisms of the individual technologies will be characterized. Finally, the knowledge on the inactivation mechanisms will be used to design optimal (RF, NTP) hurdle technology powder treatment strategies. Last modified: 25-04-2024 Created using DMPonline.be.
