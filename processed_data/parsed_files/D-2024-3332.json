The reuse of existing data will only happen insofar as this data is found in the archives or collected through contacts with actors. Throughout the project, it is possible that through new collaborations data will be shared with the researcher . If so, this will be added to the data management plan. FWO DMP - 12A0O25N (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 8 Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number. ☐ Yes, human subject data ; provide SMEC or EC a pproval number: ☐ Yes, animal data; provide ECD reference number: ☐ Yes, dual use; provide approval number : ☒ No Additional information : Will you process personal data4? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number). ☒ Yes (provide PRET G -number or EC S -number below) ☐ No Additional information: When conducting interviews personal data such as name, age, gender, profession, home municipality, email address, phone number will be collected. Interviews will be recorded and transcribed. Names of interviewees will be pseudonymised, unless it is relevant/necessary to use the name of the interviewee (e.g. an architect or a politician) and the interviewee consents to using their personal data. The file where the pseudonyms are linked to the personal data and identifiers will be stored separately on the KU Leuven server. Data that might revea l the identity of the respondents will be replaced with less 'revealing' information. Interviewees will include: (former) politicians, members of citizens' associations, architects activists from neighbourhood committees, officials from public institutions , and members of companies that are involved in biodiversity offsetting processes in the three case studies. Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin - offs, commercial exploitation, … )? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes , please comment : 4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP - 12A0O25N (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9 Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements , research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata . Through a clear folder structure located on the One Drive, existing data and developed material will be organised in order to simplify retrieving and consulting the overall documentation. Produced material will adopt meaningful filenaming starting with the date (year/month/day, e.g. 230331_), description of its content and, when applicable, ending with the initials of the creator. README files: data will be described according to category (archival, interviews, images) and structured according to several identifiers: title, year, location, author/creator, fil e type, key words FWO DMP - 12A0O25N (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: We are currently looking into the options regarding the different metadata standards within our research groups P.PUL. Possible options until now are DDI, UNBIS and AAT. 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored?

If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If no, please specify : How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . Guidance on security for research data Onedrive documents will be shared only among the supervisors and PhD researchers of the research project. In case documents are shared outside of the research project (e.g. within the research group) this will be done with restricted acces (shared via e -mail) and editing rights (view -only). What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? KU Leuven provides ample storage space through OneDrive and SharePoint. No additional storage devices will have to be funded. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). Guidance on data preservation ☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be ke pt for 10 years (explain) FWO DMP - 12A0O25N (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12 Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive K U Leuven storage guide . ☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J- drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? KU Leuven provides ample long term storage space through SharePoint. No additional storage devices will be needed . 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE ’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE , CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY .

If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS . IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED , THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED . DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT .

How will these costs be covered? There are no expected costs for data sharing. 7. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project? The data documentation and metadata will be managed by the postdoctoral researcher, Koenraad Danneels. Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project? The data storage and backup will be managed by the postdoctoral researcher, Koenraad Danneels. Who will manage data preservation and sharing? The responsible person will be Koenraad Danneels, senior fellow funded by FWO. As a fallback option, , prof. Bruno Notteboom, supervisor of this project , will be responsible for data preservation and sharing . Who will update and implement this DMP? The data management plan will be updated and implemented by the postdoctoral researcher, Koenraad Danneels."
