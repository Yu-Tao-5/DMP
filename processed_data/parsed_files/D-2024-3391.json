The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.  \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal.

This includes the evolutionary conserved glycoprotein hormones (GPHs) that \nare essential in the regulation of growth, metabolism, and reproduction. Among these hormones, \nthyrostimulin represents the ancestral glycoprotein hormone that ’s present in both vertebrate and \ninvertebrate animals. While GPHs have been investigated for decades,  their extra -hypo physeal \nroles and thyrostimulin’s mode -of-action remain understudie d. In this project, I aim to elucidate \nthe role of  thyrostimulin  signaling in the regulat ion of  enteric system function and it signaling  \nmechanisms . This is feasible using the genetic model organism Caenorhabditis elegans  and its \nwell-defined enteric system. Using a combination of advanced imaging  techniques  and state -of-\nthe-art molecular tools , I will gain insight on the physiological roles and molecular mechanisms of \nthe conserved thyrsotimulin GPH in the enteric system.  \n \n2.

Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contract ual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation ☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)?

How will these costs be covered? Data storage and backup costs at the end of this project are estimated at 3500 EUR. The cost will be covered by research grand budgets. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE ’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE , CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY .

If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. ☒ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Other data repository ( KU Leuven Lirias 2.0 repository ) ☐ Other (specify) When will the data be made available? ☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS . IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED , THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED .

If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA . ☒ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☐ No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Data sharing including journal publication fees are estimated to be around 4000 EUR . This cost will be covered by the research project funds. 7.
