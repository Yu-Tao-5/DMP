Likewise, when seeking access to remedy for violations of their labour and social rights, third country\nnational migrant workers find themselves on the margins of protection due to the fragmented approach to the procedural safeguards\nand protective measures that purport to guarantee access to remedy, particularly complaints mechanisms. This project will contribute to\nthe state of the art adopting an innovative dual theoretical perspective that will first diagnose the root causes of the structural injustices\n(Young 1990) that are created by EU labour migration legal rules (Mantouvalou 2023) and second identify how their undesirable effects\non third country nationals can be mitigated by building on Hastie’s capabilities assessment of migrant workers’ access to remedy\n(2017). The project results will strive for “a more coherent and ambitious rights-based legal migration agenda” (De Lange et al 2022) by\nmaking concrete evidence-based recommendations and proposals of how (new and existing) measures can be (better) implemented\nor developed in practice.\nID: \nID: \n214179\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-11-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n31-10-2027\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n02-04-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
