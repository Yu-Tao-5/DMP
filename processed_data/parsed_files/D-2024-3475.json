For many decades, the bacterial ribosome was successfully targeted by small\nmolecule antibiotics, but many of them lost potential due to the development of antibiotic resistance. This project aims to target the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of bacteria\nusing oligonucleotides (ON). To date, synthetic ON are used to modulate the expression of specific genes by interaction with mRNA in biotechnology and in the clinic. I\nwill focus on the highly conserved 3’-end of the 16S rRNA, essential in translation initiation within the prokaryotic world. A biotechnological approach will be used to\nperform a wet lab selection for ribose-based ONs to inhibit protein synthesis through interaction with rRNA in the bacterial ribosome. In parallel, an in silico approach\nwill be established to design morpholino-based ONs with specific stereochemistry and sequence to target the selected RNA fragment. Phosphorodiamidate\nmorpholino ONs (PMOs) are used in a mixture with millions of stereo-isomers as no stereospecific synthesis is available. Recently my host lab prepare synthons for\nisopure  synthesis of methyl-phosphorodiamidate morpholino ONs (Me-PMOs). Stereopure Me-PMOs allow to determine the effect of backbone stereochemistry on\nbiophysical characterisation and biological activity. Selected ON constructs will be screened for inhibition of ribosomal translation and antibacterial activity on clinical\nrelevant pathogens. \nID: \nID: \n210752\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-11-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n31-10-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n06-04-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Creator: Creator: Sten Reynders Affiliation: Affiliation: KU Leuven (KUL) Funder: Funder: Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) Template: Template: FWO DMP (Flemish Standard DMP) Project abstract: Project abstract: Rapid development of antibiotic-resistance urges the search for new antibiotics. For many decades, the bacterial ribosome was successfully targeted by small molecule antibiotics, but many of them lost potential due to the development of antibiotic resistance. This project aims to target the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of bacteria using oligonucleotides (ON). To date, synthetic ON are used to modulate the expression of specific genes by interaction with mRNA in biotechnology and in the clinic. I will focus on the highly conserved 3’-end of the 16S rRNA, essential in translation initiation within the prokaryotic world. A biotechnological approach will be used to perform a wet lab selection for ribose-based ONs to inhibit protein synthesis through interaction with rRNA in the bacterial ribosome. In parallel, an in silico approach will be established to design morpholino-based ONs with specific stereochemistry and sequence to target the selected RNA fragment. Phosphorodiamidate morpholino ONs (PMOs) are used in a mixture with millions of stereo-isomers as no stereospecific synthesis is available. Recently my host lab prepare synthons for isopure synthesis of methyl-phosphorodiamidate morpholino ONs (Me-PMOs). Stereopure Me-PMOs allow to determine the effect of backbone stereochemistry on biophysical characterisation and biological activity. Selected ON constructs will be screened for inhibition of ribosomal translation and antibacterial activity on clinical relevant pathogens.
