Their importance is directly \nrelated to their facile synthesis, rigid cavity, tunable solubilit y, and ease of functionalization. However, the \nlatter stands in stark contrast to their challenging selective desymmetrization. Additionally, \nfunctionalization of the 3,6 -aryl and lateral positions is significantly underexplored. Larger ring sizes of \npilla r[n]arenes have, moreover, only scarcely been reported due to the low yield and difficult \nreproducibility of their synthesis. Despite these drawbacks, such macrocycles have proven crucial for \ninfluential applications. Therefore, a new class of macrocyclic rings facilitating desymmetrization, \nextensive functionalization, and the synthesis of large rings would be attractive. This project tackles these \nlimitations through the synthesis and functionalization of novel oxygen -containing members of the \npillar[n]ar ene family, the oxapillar[n]arene[m]quinones (OPAQs). These macrocycles, having a robust \nsynthesis, were obtained in preliminary work. As their qualities are promising to counter the mentioned \ndrawbacks, this project will build on these results and focus o n four principal goals. The first goals are \ndeveloping a synthetic method for OPAQs of different substitution patterns and ring sizes, and establishing \nsuitable postfunctionalization routes. Then, extensive structural characterization will be performed. La stly, \nthe host properties will be evaluated.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        4 \n 2.

FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 3 Please provide a short project description Pillar[n]arenes hold a prominent position within supramolecular chemistry. Their importance is directly related to their facile synthesis, rigid cavity, tunable solubilit y, and ease of functionalization. However, the latter stands in stark contrast to their challenging selective desymmetrization. Additionally, functionalization of the 3,6 -aryl and lateral positions is significantly underexplored. Larger ring sizes of pilla r[n]arenes have, moreover, only scarcely been reported due to the low yield and difficult reproducibility of their synthesis. Despite these drawbacks, such macrocycles have proven crucial for influential applications. Therefore, a new class of macrocyclic rings facilitating desymmetrization, extensive functionalization, and the synthesis of large rings would be attractive. This project tackles these limitations through the synthesis and functionalization of novel oxygen -containing members of the pillar[n]ar ene family, the oxapillar[n]arene[m]quinones (OPAQs). These macrocycles, having a robust synthesis, were obtained in preliminary work. As their qualities are promising to counter the mentioned drawbacks, this project will build on these results and focus o n four principal goals. The first goals are developing a synthetic method for OPAQs of different substitution patterns and ring sizes, and establishing suitable postfunctionalization routes. Then, extensive structural characterization will be performed. La stly, the host properties will be evaluated. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 4 2.

It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all mat erials that need proper management because they are valuable, difficult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an in tegral part of your datasets and should described under documentation/metadata. RDM Guidance on data FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10 If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type .

Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures u sed, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata . Two types of data will be gathered during this project. Chemical data from experiments (reaction conditions, experimental sequence, observations, amount of reagents used) will be stored by the researcher in Microsoft OneDrive (2 TB), MBook ELN(Electronic L ab Notebooks) and analog lab notebooks. Corresponding structural identification data for the obtained compounds (raw and processed) will be uploaded in the ELN and linked to the correct experiment making data traceable. Data from binding studies will be preserved digitally . All project data will be shared with the PI and other collaborators via Microsoft OneDrive and via the ELN.

CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYS TEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . Guidance on security for research data OneDrive is not publicly accessible and password protected. Access needs to be granted by the researcher and will be limited to the PI (and his delegate responsible for dat a storage). For co llaborations, accessibility to the re levant files will be granted if described in a non -disclosure agreement. Archival storage at KU Leuven is not publicly accessible and only people with permission (PI and his delegate responsible for data storage) can a ccess the data. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The use of OneDrive is free of charge if the capacity of 2 TB is not exceeded. Archival data storage is centrally offered via KU Leuven at 270 Euro/TB/Year. MBook ELN and the cloud service are offered by Mestrelab at 10 Euro/month for the subscription and a one-time license fee of 120 Euro. These costs are being covered by the general operating b udget of the research group, or by the individual bench fee of researchers. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 14 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). Guidance on data preservation ☐ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☒ Certain data cannot be ke pt for 10 years (explain) Samples will be stored for 10 years in our depository as long as the long -term stability and quantity of the compound allow it. Wher e will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data . Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide . ☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☒ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): KU Leuven Archive drive (K-drive) What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Data archival at KU Leuven is currently offered at 270 Euro/TB/year. Since no large datasets are generated in this project, one TB of storage will be sufficient and the price for storage for 10 years is 2700 Euro. These costs are covered by the general operating budget of the research group or by the individual bench fee of researchers. 6.
