Firstly, limitations in mass transfer and ligand distribution will be\novercome by designing 3- dimensional membrane matrix. Secondly, breakthrough in binding\nkinetics entails the incorporation of stimuli-responsive functionality into the membrane to\nachieve selective separation with reduced consumption of process materials. Lastly,\ncomputational modeling is used to bring mechanistic understanding on mass transport and\nbinding kinetics, facilitating technology scale-up. The obtained results will directly impact efforts\nin bioprocessing, healthcare and broadly product purification.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 5\ntype of data\nFormat\nVolume\n How created\nMicroscopy\nimages\n.tif\n200-\n500GB\nmicroscopic\nimages of the\nstructure of\nmembranes\nFourier-\ntransform\ninfrared\nspectroscopy\nUncompressed\ntiff\n2-5GB\nQualitative\nsurface\nchemistry\nanalysis of\nmembrane\nsamples\nX-ray\nphotoelectron\nspectroscopy\nuncompressed\ntiff\n10-\n20GB\nquantitative\nelemental\nanalysis of\nmembrane\nsamples \nOther\nexperimental\ndata \nlab books,\n.txt. csv\n1-2GB\nThe original data\nmay consist of\nthe\nexperimentally\nacquired values\nduring filtration\ntesting.\ncomputational\ncodes/programs\n.txt, .matlab\n1-5GB\nnumerical\nsimulation of\nchromatographic\nmembrane\nprocesses \n \n \nThe expected types of data generated from this research are publishable research manuscripts\nand patents. The original data may consist of the experimentally acquired values (e.g., lab books,\n.txt. csv) and computational codes/programs (e.g., matlab, .txt) in the chemical engineering\ndomain,these however may be reused for future research development. Nevertheless, not all\ndata will be\nkept beyond the lifetime of the proposed project, such as invalid data (that is not\nreproduceable), and data that can contribute to the public knowledge domain, e.g., as journal\npublications and for education training purposes. Overall, there is no personal data involved.\n3. Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse.

In\ncase an interesting the design of the membranes and separation devices will be identified, a\npatent application may be submitted in collaboration with KU Leuven Research & Development\n(LRD). However, further research outside of this FWO project will be needed to support a\npotential patent application.\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nDigital data:\nFor each WP, the (e-)labbooks will contain information on experimental design,\nprotocols, sample evaluation (WP1 and 2), abbreviations used, structure of\nthe data (including link with physical storage of data), and steps involved in data\nanalysis and relevant analysis scripts (matlab or CFD scripts). A clear\ncoding for all data files related to the project will be used. These will have the form:\nWPX_TaskY_yyyymmdd_NameExperiment. Templates for such documentation will be provided by\nthe PI to everyone associated to the project to allow consistent\ndocumentation. In the concluding stage of the project, a master index file containing the\ncombined information for all WPs will be compiled which will be archived and also stored on the\npersonal harddrives/PC of the PI. Altogether, this should allow any secondary analyst to use the\ndata accurately and effectively.\nPhysical data:\nSamples taken from the field or from experiments will be documented and stored in freezers for\nup to 1 years after the end of the project, and a file with test details (in Access)\n(identification/source of origin/main characteristics/storage medium/revival guide/location in the\nchemical storage) will be maintained.

Sensitive data will not be carried on unprotected personal\ndevices. When the research project ends, there are a few options to preserve the data for\nminimum of 5 years, such as KU Leuven/UZ Leuven servers, archiving and/or share/publish data.\nAlso, we can make use of the general repositories such as Harvard's Dataverse and internal KU\nLeuven repository (i.e.,Lirias).\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nThe time-stamped master copy of the data will be kept on our research unit central\nstorage facility (KU Leuven server) and BOX. In addition, copies will be made and kept on\npersonal devices.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central server with automatic daily back-\nup procedures. The general repositories such as Harvard's Dataverse and internal KU Leuven\nrepository (i.e.,Lirias) can be used.

How\nwill these costs be covered?\nCosts will be covered by the project or lab budget whenever needed.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nThe access to the folder containing all project related data is restricted to the project researchers\nand access can only be granted by the PI. Furthermore, data on the general repositories such as\nHarvard's Dataverse and internal KU Leuven repository (i.e.,Lirias) will be protected by a\npassword. For extra safety we will (for the smaller data sets) also have back-ups on external hard\ndisks that are kept at the office of the PI.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nDigital data:\nKU Leuven policy on data management will be followed which entails a preservation term of 5\nyears. Sequencing data will be submitted to public databases, where they will be permanently\narchived to preserve access to the public.
