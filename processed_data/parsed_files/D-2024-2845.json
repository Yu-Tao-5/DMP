The gold standard treatment for rectal cancer (RC) is a low anterior resection,\ncombined with chemoradiotherapy. However, given the improved oncological results, functional outcomes, such as bowel symptoms, become more\nand more important. Approximately 60-90% of RC patients are affected with a wide range of new onset bowel symptoms (incontinence for flatus or\nfeces (solid, liquid), frequent bowel movements, urgency, clustering of defecation and evacuation problems) immediately after rectal treatment. The\ncombination of these specific bowel symptoms and their impact on quality of life (QoL) has been summarized in an international consensus definition\nand is referred to as the Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS).\nMajor LARS has an important impact on QoL and has major health economic consequences. This is attributable to its high prevalence after RC\ntreatment, the chronic nature of symptoms and the limited evidence of available therapeutic options. This context leads to repetitive medical\nconsultations, additional technical examinations which are often not very useful and need for prolonged medical treatment (multiple drug regimens),\nwith often limited therapeutic gain. Furthermore, there is a lack of a comprehensive scoring system to identify the different aspects of LARS, leading\nto inadequate diagnostics and follow-up of symptoms.\nBased on these considerations, there is a clear need for a comprehensive scoring system for identification of the different aspects of LARS and\nmonitoring of therapeutic treatment.\nThe aim of this study is to develop a solid, patient-friendly and easy to interpret electronic bowel diary. This e-diary will be used to comprehensively\nmap the complaints of patients, facilitating a prompt and effective approach to symptoms. In this way, it can contribute to improving the well-being of\npatients with rectal cancer and their surroundings in the healthcare process.\nThe first objective of this study is to extract items for a comprehensive bowel diary in patients with rectal cancer (Aim 1) based on a literature review\n(Aim 1a), a patient focus group (Aim 1b) and an international Delphi survey (Aim 1c). In this Delphi survey, a multidisciplinary group of experts and\npatients will score each item of the long list on a 1–9-point Likert scale from ‘Not Important’ (1) to ‘Essential’ (9) for inclusion in the bowel diary.\nFinally, a consensus meeting will be held for the participants who completed the Delphi survey (Aim 1d).\nThe subsequent objective of this study is to develop a new bowel diary (Aim 2). Based on the consensus meeting, a specific number of topics will be\nselected for inclusion in this bowel diary (Aim 2a). Thereafter, the bowel diary will be translated from English to Dutch (Aim 2b). The English and\nDutch diary are then presented to a focus group of patients to assess content validity (Aim 2c). Subsequently, the e-diary will be developed (Aim 2d).\nThe third objective is to assess the usability (Aim 3a) and validity of the e-diary (Aim 3b), including construct validity, criterion validity, test-retest\nreliability and responsiveness.\n \n \nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n14-02-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
