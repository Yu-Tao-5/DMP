What previous genera-tions of philosophers found irritating, i.e., that this\nphilosophy cannot easily be categorized as a vari-ety of German Idealism, is precisely what many contemporary scholars find attractive. For them,\nSchelling is important not only as a sharp critic of German Idealism but also a precursor of much later philosophical paradigms such as Nietzsche’s\nphilosophy of life, existentialism, and contemporary New Realism. At the same time, and unlike many representatives of these later movements,\nSchelling never gave up the core questions of traditional metaphysics, i.e., questions concerning the founda-tions of Being, the existence of God, and\nthe ontological status of the human mind within the whole of reality. He combined this interest with a profound dissatisfaction with the available\napproaches (i.e., scholasticism, rationalism, empiricism, Kantianism, Fichtean and Hegelian idealism), and this caused him to search for innovative\napproaches to these classical questions. The aim of the project is to examine a central topic of Schelling’s philosophy, which is ad-dressed—sometimes\nmore, sometimes less explicitly—in virtually all of his published and posthu-mously published works, i.e., God. Schelling’s theological views evolve\nover time, too, from his early account of God as the absolute subject via the (alleged) pantheism of his philosophy of identity to the gradual formation\nof his idea of divine creation from the Ages of the World fragments to his late philosophy of revelation. Each of these different periods of his work\nhave been studied by Schelling scholars, but what is missing is a comprehensive study of Schelling’s development as a philosophi-cal theologian. The\naim of this project is to close this research gap in current Schelling scholarship by a thor-oughgoing exegesis and systematic reconstruction of\nSchelling’s philosophical theology from his early theological writings to his late Presentation of a Purely Rational Philosophy and his lectures on the\nPhilosophy of Mythology and Revelation. The guiding research hypothesis is that the changes in Schelling’s views about God and theology can be\nrendered intelligible by careful textual analysis and theoretical reconstruction. Schelling’s thinking is geared towards problem-solving, including the\nprob-lems that his own previous thoughts have created. This dynamism is also operative in his philosophi-cal theology. Hence the hypothesis I wish to\ntest is that understanding this dynamism is the key to making sense of the development of Schelling’s theology. The project thus contributes to the\ncurrent revival of Schelling studies in the Anglophone world and in France and Germany. Unlike many other current Schelling projects the genesis of\nSchelling’s entire philosophy will be taken into view.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n02-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
