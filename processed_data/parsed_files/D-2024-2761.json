This access is controlled by the head of our research group (Kai Dallmeier).  \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?The costs of a KU Leuven server storage are: 415.2 euros/year for the J drive (1.4 TB), 1138.4 euros/year \nfor the L drive (10 TB) and 22.768 euros/year for the K drive. The costs for data storage and backups are \nconcerning the whole research group and are not specific for this project.

How will these costs be covered?Costs to preserve data on the K drive will depend on the storage size at a specific moment in time as this \ncan always be increased/decreased on demand,  but are estimated at 11.4 euros/100 GB. This is paid \nannually and concern the whole research group. The costs will be divided over all funding available by our \nresearch group.\n6.

RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .Daily labwork (protocols, calculations, results,…) will be documented in an online OneNote labbook which is continuously being backed up by KU Leuven servers. Additionally, original files with raw data and files with analysed data will be labelled and stored on servers controlled and backed up by the KU Leuven IT department. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: For flow cytometry and ELISpot, FCS files containing metadata will be generated and stored. If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data.☒ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☐ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☒ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☐ Other: All data will be stored on drives controlled and backed up by KU Leuven. Data with small volumes will be stored on the J drive, in a subfolder that can only be accessed by personnel of the MVVD group. Additionally on an online sharepoint, only accessible for MVVD group, all manuscripts (drafts) will be stored for long term storage. The separate K-drive of KU Leuven will be used for long term storage of files and data from finished projects . Biological samples from experiments will be stored in freezers and registered in https://freezerpro.rega How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? ☒ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back-ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) The data will be stored on KU Leuven central servers (J/K/L drives). A back-up of the data on these drives will automatically be generated two times per day. Additionally, data will be mirrored and stored on a cloud-based service offered by KU Leuven (OneDrive), which is synced every 10 minutes. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No All data with small volumes will be stored on the J drive controlled by KU Leuven. There is sufficient storage space foreseen (1.4 Tb) and this is constantly monitored by KU Leuven IT services. Data with larger volumes (microscopy images, FASTQ files) will be stored on a specifically allocated L drive of KU Leuven on which sufficient storage space is foreseen (10 TB) and which is also constantly monitored by KU Leuven IT services. The separate K-drive of KU Leuven will be used for long term storage of files and data from finished projects (200 GB). If needed, capacity of these KU Leuven drives can be increased at any time. If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data All data will be stored on a KU Leuven backed up server, for which access is only granted to the MVVD group members. This access is controlled by the head of our research group (Kai Dallmeier). What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?The costs of a KU Leuven server storage are: 415.2 euros/year for the J drive (1.4 TB), 1138.4 euros/year for the L drive (10 TB) and 22.768 euros/year for the K drive. The costs for data storage and backups are concerning the whole research group and are not specific for this project. Hence, the costs will be divided over all funding available by our group including the bench fee available by this project. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) All generated data of this project will be stored in a folder on the network drive specifically designated for long term storage (K drive), which is controlled and backed up by KU Leuven. Data will be retained for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. Biological samples (RNA, tissues,…) will be stored in freezers (-80°C) until publication of the results. Relevant samples (virus stocks, cell lines) which can be reused in other projects will be preserved in freezers as long as possible. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): The data, associated metadata and electronical labbooks will be stored on the K drive of KU Leuven with automatic back-up procedures for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Costs to preserve data on the K drive will depend on the storage size at a specific moment in time as this can always be increased/decreased on demand, but are estimated at 11.4 euros/100 GB. This is paid annually and concern the whole research group. The costs will be divided over all funding available by our research group. 6.
