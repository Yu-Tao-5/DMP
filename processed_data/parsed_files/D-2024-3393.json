In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). It should be possible to preserve all data for the 10 year KU Leuven RDM policy, as it consists of only digital material. The main data types will be the models and codes, whereas datasets will only be preserved if they are self-compiled. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Most materials will be stored on the KU Leuven RDR repository where possible, code from GitHub will be kept there as well. If in need of other storage solutions over time, this will be discussed together with the supervisor (but not expected to). What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Most data preservation should remain free, but as mentioned above, extensions remain to be seen later on in the project. In the case storage fees would be required, a budget can be made available. 5. Data sharing and reuse 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) Yes, in an Open Access repository Final models and scripts for data preparation wil be made openly available. Self-compiled data may either be made openly available and/or with restricted access If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 27 March 2025 4 of 6 Self-compiled occurrence data may comprise occurrences of rare species, which may be vulnerable. If the data would be made open access, species names would be made anonymized, whereas non-anonymized species data could be requested under specific conditions. This will depend on the final format and possible own agreements with 3rd party data providers. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes, Ethical aspects Please see the explanation above about the vulnerable species occurrences. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. Code candidate repositories: RDR, GitHub Occurrence candidate repositories (to be decided on if necessary): Seafile, Pangaea Finished state if: Models & code are optimized and working properly. Adaptations can always be made on GitHub using version control, whereas other data will only be uploaded on other repositories at the end of the project or if a part of it (work package) is considered finished. When will the data be made available? When will the data be made available? (Pleas also see above:) On GitHub: as soon as code is properly working, as it can be regularly updated Occurrence/graph data: at the end of the project or if they are finished to a standard shape (e.g. similar to the GeoPlant dataset.

For code: licences compatible to the used packages/software..., probably one of GNU General Public License, MIT or 3-Clause BSD License. For occurrence/graph data: again dependent on the sources, but open data: probably CC-BY. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)?

What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? This remains to be seen. For models and code, free repositories will be used. 6. Responsibilities 6.
