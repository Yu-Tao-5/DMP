The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning.

From  \nthe outset of this civil war, the highly institutionalized mediation proposals and efforts of the Roman Catholic  \nChurch (RCC) have proven ineffective. Why has this been the case? This project critically examines the  \ndominant ecclesiologies that have thus far shaped the RCC’s political mediation and seeks to renegotiate the  \nrole of the RCC in the conflict from the margins. It interrogates the ambiguities inherent in any ecclesial  \nengagement  in  peacebuilding  and  nation-building  within  this  type  of  political  crisis.  Through  an  \nethnographic study involving ordinary civilians and their ecclesial practices, and whose findings are critically  \ncorrelated with the RCC’s official theopolitical discourse  within a theoretical framework formed by Hartmut  \nRosa's theory of resonance and the minor literature of Guattari and Deleuze, this PhD project thus suggests  \nthe emergence of a minor and resonant ecclesiology as a paradigm in which the nature and theopolitical role  \nof the Church are rethought and rendered more complex. At the same time, it envisions a new model of  \nintegrative mediation, along with pathways for peacebuilding and nation-building.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.
