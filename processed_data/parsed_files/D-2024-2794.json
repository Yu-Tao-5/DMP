Despite its crucial role, the entry environment remains poorly understood and replicating it on Earth is difficult. Research is needed to\ndevelop more efficient Thermal Protection Systems (TPSs), as well as to solve the problem of space debris. The Von Karman Institute for Fluid\nDynamics uses plasma facilities to recreate the extreme conditions encountered at the stagnation point of an entry vehicle. The current methodology to\nreproduce flight conditions in a ground facility has two downsides: (1) it is a costly hybrid numerical/experimental procedure and (2) it is limited to the\nduplication of a single flight trajectory point. This project aims to use data-driven methods to simplify the methodology, a necessary step towards\ndynamic testing, i.e. reproducing entire sections of the entry trajectory in a single test. Doing so replicates the heating history in a ground test, leading\nto more efficient TPS designs, and a better assessment of space debris demisability. As an application, the resulting method will be applied to the\ninnovative re-entry mission under development by Aether, KU Leuven's Student CubeSat Team. Aether aims to create a CubeSat platform that enables\nthe return of samples and experiments from LEO, reducing the cost for experiments in space for sectors that require this capability.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n29-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Raw data from VKI repository is accompanied by log.xlsx file as is customary at VKI, listing relevant information (experimental campaign, facility operator, probes used, targeted facility operating conditions, remarks/issues during experiment). Any missing entries are complemented where possible by test engineer notebooks. Plasmatron experimental data (new test campaigns) Raw data files are accompanied by log.xlsx file (see above). ROVT computations ROVT input settings are listed for each trajectory simulation in a config.xlsx file. Stagline computations Stagline input conditions/settings are stored in input files accompanying each simulation. Each simulation has corresponding entries in 2 .csv files: freestream.csv listing freestream conditions, corresponding ROVT trajectory point config.csv listing mesh settings, boundary conditions LHTS methodology data processing code All scripts/functions have inline documentation. Higher level directories have README.txt files explaining how to use the code. The code is maintained on VKI's github server as part of the ROVT code, with its own README.md file. Plasmatron data readout code Same approach as for LHTS methodology code (above). High fidelity hypersonic CFD Geometry information, boundary conditions, mesh settings for each simulation kept in README.txt files.
