The F WO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official  start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO \nbut to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel.  Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.  \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation  Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives  of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions.  This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary  of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.  \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   2 \n 1.

However, the \nenergy flexibility potential of active participation in  demand response  is unclear. To es timate it, \nunderstanding, quantifying, and modeling households’ comfort elasticities – defined in this project  as the \nrelationship between changes in comfort requirements and energy costs – is needed . In this view, this \nproject has 3 objectives. (1) Mixed methods case studies will enable understanding and quantifying \ndiverse households’ comfort elasticities. (2) Active participation in residential demand response will be \nmodeled using  the quantified e lasticities .

These data will be used as part of the research.  Moreover, some of \nthe data gathered during my previous projects will be reused (i.e. PDM on the same topic and the oPEN \nLab projec t). In the informed consent forms of these student works and projects, households agreed/will \nagree  that the data could be (reused) for research.  \n \n5 These data are generated by  combining multiple existing datasets.  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   8 \n Are there any ethical issues concerning the \ncreation and/or use of the data  \n(e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual \nuse)? If so, please d escribe these issues further \nand refer to specific datasets or data types \nwhen appropriate.  ☒ Yes, human subject data  \n☐ Yes, animal data  \n☐ Yes, dual use  \n☐ No \nIf yes, please describe:  All data gathered during the case studies deal with household behavior, energy \ndemand and comfort, involving  human subjects that participate voluntarily. They may include potentially \nvulnerable individuals or households. The data includes  personal data.  Furthermore, t hese data will be the \nbasis for models of household  behavior, which will be included in building simulations and a MPC \nframework. Approval from the Social and Societal Ethics Committee (SMEC) has been  obtained through \nthe PRET platform.  \n \n \nWill you process personal  data6? If so, briefly \ndescribe the kind of personal data you will use . \nPlease refer to specific datasets or data types \nwhen appropriate . If available, add the reference \nto your file in your host institution's privacy \nregister.  ☒ Yes \n☐ No \nIf yes:  \n \n- Short description of the kind of personal data that will be used:  \nThe following categories of personal data will be processed during the surveys and possibly the interviews: \nidentification data (i.e. address, e -mail address, phone number and IP addresses), personal characteristics \n(i.e. age, birth sex/gender, marital sta tus, and nationality), financial data (i.e. salary data), consumption \npatterns, education and training, lifestyle and habits, family composition (i.e. number and characteristics \nof children (e.g. gender, age), and number of residents), and characteristics of individuals' dwelling  \n(including drawings/plans of the dwelling) . Furthermore , recordings (i.e. audio recordings, video \nrecordings, and photographs)  will be made during the interviews . \n \nIn addition, data that fall under the heading of ‘s pecial categories’ of personal data will also be processed. \nIn particular, data providing information on racial or ethnic origin and data or a person's health (physical \nand mental , like stress and depression ) may be processed.  \n \n6 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   9 \n  \nThe ICF will be kept separat ely from the other data . Personal identification data will be known only to the \nresearchers directly involved and all data (except the audio recordings of the interviews , video recordings  \nand plans, as indicated below ) will be pseudonymized as soon as poss ible and feasible . The codes used for \npseudonymization will be stored in a different location from the data . In pseudonymi zation, it will be \nensured that the different types of data collected from the same household can still be linked for \nintegrated analysis.  In transcripts, notes, names of files, on the surveys, etc., the actual names and \naddresses of participants will be replaced by pseudonyms. Faces of individuals in photographs will be \nmade unrecogni zable  and together with the plans, th ey will be kept. After all, i nformation  included in the \nphotos and plans  is necessary if future researchers want to gain insight into the dwellings  they are \nanaly zing. Audio recordings will be deleted once transcribed.  For video recordings , it will be asse ssed at \nthe end of the research which of them  are necessary to keep  for future researchers . \n \nNote that during the research, p hotographs and other material with identifiable individuals will only be \nused for research purposes and edited for publications so that no individuals can be identified from these. \nHowever, it is possible that people familiar with participants' dwellings  may recogni ze them based on \ndescriptions, plans or pictures of them.  \n \n- Privacy Registry Reference:  G-2024 -8498  \n \n \nDoes your work have potential for commercial \nvalorization (e.g. tech transfer , for example spin -\noffs, commercial exploitation, … )?  \nIf so, please comment per dataset  or data type \nwhere appropriate . ☒ Yes \n☐ No \nIf yes , please comment :  \nThe TRL level of research results will still be too low to lead directly to commercial applications. However, \nthe research may become part of future SBO, ICON, or Horizon 2020 projects, where commercial \nvalori zation of the research results will take place.  This valorizatio n may, for instance, focus on the \ndevelopment of interfaces that enable a two -way interaction between households and advanced \ncontrollers (e.g. MPC).  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   10 \n Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict \nexploitation or dissemination of the data you \n(re)use (e.g. Mat erial/Data transfer agreements , \nresearch  collaboration agreements)?  \nIf so, please explain to what data they relate and \nwhat restrictions are in place.  ☐ Yes \n☒ No \nIf yes, please explain:  \n \nAre there any other legal issues, such as \nintellectual property rights and ownership, to be \nmanaged related to the data you (re)use?  \nIf so, please explain to what data they relate and \nwhich restrictions will be asserted.  ☐ Yes \n☒ No \nIf yes, please explain:  \n \n \n \n \n3. Documentation and Metadata  \n \nClearly describe what approach will be followed \nto capture the accompanying information \nnecessary to keep data understandable and \nusable , for yourself and others, now and in the \nfuture (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and \ntypes required, procedures used, Electronic Lab \nNotebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. \nwhere this information is recorded).  \n For each dataset described above a ReadMe file  will be set up describing the data collection, processing  \n(e.g. data cleaning)  and analysis methods. For each of these stages of the data life cycle it will be described \nwho did what, when, how and why. Moreover, information on the ethical approval (refer ence number and \ninstitution) will be given. Particularly for the data collection stage, a logbook  will complement the ReadMe \nfiles, tracking information on the steps taken (e.g. placement of devices) and reasons for missing data. \nMissing data  will be indic ated with NA in all data files. Additionally, general information  on the ethical \napplication and approval, informed consent example, the instructions we gave participants, a PDF of the \nquestionnaires and interview guide, information about the sensors used,  and information about  the \nsoftware used for the household behavior model, MPC framework and building simulations will be \nprovided . Furthermore, at data level a codebook  will be set up with an explanation of each of the variable  \nlabels , the labels assigned  to values of variables  and interview codes . This includes the measurement units \nof parameters that describe the indoor conditions and energy demands, production and storage, the unit \nof energy prices and costs, the question of the questionnaire that relat es to each of the variable labels in \nthe corresponding datafile , an explanation of the labels assigned to values of variables of the \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   11 \n questionnaire  and their range , and an explanation of interview codes . The ReadMe files , logbook , general \ninformation  and co debooks will be stored in the same folder as the ir corresponding  data. For the \nhousehold behavior model and the MPC framework, a code explanation will be given in the code  itself, \nexplaining each step.  For these frameworks as well as the building simulation models, Git may  be used as \nversion control system. All datasets will be organized in folders in a structed way , with a clear  file and \nfolder naming.  \n \nWill a metadata standard be used to make it \neasier to find and reuse the data ?  \n \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard \nwill be used. If not, please specify which \nmetadata will be created to make the data \neasier to find and reuse.  \n \nREPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN \nFORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. \nSTANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . \n ☒ Yes \n☐ No \nIf yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata  standard  will be used :  \nAt the end of the research project, t he data will be stored on KU Leuven's institutional research data \nrepository (RDR)  in case others have indicated to be willing to reuse the data or  KU Leuven’s  cold storage \nsolution when this is not the case . The  corresponding  recommended metadata model will be applied.  \n \nIf no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created:  \n \n \n \n \n \n4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project  \n \nWhere will the data be stored?  Digital and audiovisual data will be stored on a secure network drive of KU Leuven (e.g. I - / J-drive) , only \naccessible to the researchers involved in the project . To share data with students, OneDrive linked to a KU \nLeuven account will be used. I f the  students  store the data on their personal computer f or data processing \nand analysis , they will be asked to delete the data at the end of their master thesis or after finishing the \ncourse in which they gathered and analyzed data.  In case data is gathered at the oPEN Lab living lab or at \nConstructhor, these d ata will also be stored  on a database maintained within EnergyVille, by KUL and VITO \n(MS Azure cloud).  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   12 \n Physical data will be stored w ithin KU Leuven , in the principal researcher’s  office in a locked drawer or \ncabinet accessible only to the researcher . \n \nWhe n the FWO project will be complemented with other projects involving non -KU Leuven partners that \nneed access to the data, the data will be moved to Man GO, or when these partners consist only of KU \nLeuven and VITO members,  (also)  the database maintained within EnergyVille.  \nHow will the data be backed up?  \n \nWHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO \nPREVENT DATA LOSS ? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS , STORAGE MEDIA AND \nPROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP \nDIGIT AL AND NON -DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH .7 \n \nREFER TO INSTITUTION -SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP \nPROCEDURES  WHEN APPROPRIATE . \n Files on the secure network drives of KU Leuven (e.g. I - / J-drive)  and Man GO are automatically backed up.  \nFor the secure network drives of KU Leuven, backups are made using “snapshot” technology, which is the \nonline storage of incremental data changes. For the standard backup regime, as specified below, 10% of \nthe requested storag e capacity will be reserved . The standard backup regime is as follows:  \n• An hourly backup (at 8 AM, 12 PM, 4 PM and 8 PM) the last 6 of which are stored on our servers  \n• A daily backup, at midnight, the last 6 of which are stored on our servers  \n• A weekly backup , Saturday night at midnight, the last 12 of which are stored on our servers  \nThe end user can use his own Windows PC to restore files to an older version using the “previous versions” \nfunction. According to the backup system above, it is possible to go bac k in time up  to 12 weeks (~3 \nmonths) . \nMoreover, for the purpose of “business continuity” or “disaster recovery”, a mirror (exact copy) of all data \nis created in the second ICTS data centre. The data are copied every hour to the second data centre. In the \nevent that the primary storage unit is corrupted, the ICTS team can get this copy online within the hour. \nThe mirror in the second ICTS datacenter falls under type 1 storage . \n \nOneDrive also enables to restore files to an earlier version through the Version History or after deletion  \nwithin 30 days through the Recycle Bin . \n \nThrough Man GO, data is stored securely in the data centers of KU Leuven. Of each file, two copies are \nstored: one in the datacenter of Heverlee, and one in the datacenter of Leuven.  \n \n \n7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric:  https://osf.io/2z5g3/  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   13 \n A scan  of the physical data will be made and stored on a  secure network drive  of KU Leuven (e.g. I- / J-\ndrive) as well.  \n \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities  are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.  ☒ Yes \n☐ No \nIf yes, please specify concisely:  There is no storage limit on the shared network drives. Data shared with \nstudents is expected to be much less than 2 TB, the limi t of OneDrive.  \nManGO also does not have a storage limit . \n \nIf no, please specify :  \n \nHow will you ensure that the data are securely \nstored and not accessed or modified by \nunauthorized persons?  \n \nCLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , \nNETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND \nFILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND \nTRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 7 \n All ICT solutions at KU Leuven are subject to the university -wide ICT information security standards  (e.g. \nmultifactor authenticator) . Digital data will be stored in a restricted network share of t he secure network \ndrives of KU Leuven (e.g. I - / J-drive)  or ManGO . These drives  and ManGO  are therefore suitable for \nprocessing all types of personal data. When shared between researchers or students, v ideos and pictures \nwill be encrypted using 7zip. A password will be set using Passwordstate . When OneD rive is used, only \npseudonymized data will be stored online and the code list (link between the identifiable person and the \ncode to which that person has been 'translated') is kept securely on a secure network drive of KU Leuven \n(e.g. I - / J-drive).  Only p ersons involved in the research will get access to the data  during the project (and \npossibly  researchers involved in  other funded complementary research projects) . \n \nAccess to code files with pseudonyms is controlled by the principal researchers  (with the P I and Patricia \nElsen (ATP) as a back -up). \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?  Storage on the secure network drives of KU Leuven costs € 450,76 per TB per year. The necessary  funding \nfor storage and backup for the contracted service has been foreseen . OneDrive is Free for staff and \nstudents of KU Leuven. ManGO  is also free of charge.  \n \n \n \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   14 \n  \n5. Data Preservation  after the end of the Research P roject  \n \nWhich data will be retained for at least five \nyears (or longer, in agreement with other \nretention policies that are applicable) after the \nend of the  project? In case some data cannot be \npreserved , clearly state the reasons for this  \n(e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). After 10 years, it will be assessed whether it is necessary to keep all (personal) data or a part of it any \nlonger. If necessary, a reminder date will be set at that time, when this will be reassessed. If f urther \nretention  of all (personal) data or a part of it  is no longer necessary, this will be deleted.  \n \nAn exception are the audio recordings, video recordings and photographs. Audio recordings will be \ndeleted once transcribed.  For video recordings , it will be assessed at the end of the research project (or \ncomplementary research projects) which of them  are necessary to keep  for future researchers . Faces of \nindividuals in photographs will be made unrecogni zable  at the end of the  research project (or \ncomplementary research projects).  \n \nWhere will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long -term)?  In case other researchers show interest in the data, t he data will be stored on KU Leuven's institutional \nresearch data repo sitory (RDR). However , as the collected data consist of personal data, it will only be \nshared after a data sharing agreement is set up.  In case no interest is shown yet, it will be stored using KU \nLeuven’s  cold storage solution.  \nThe paper data will be  kept  in the office of Patricia Elsen (ATP) in a locked drawer or cabinet that is only \naccessible to her and prof. Dirk  Saelens.  \nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during the expected retention \nperiod? How will these costs be covered?  \n \n \n We expect that no costs will be associated with storing the data on RDR. Every researcher can store 50 GB \nper year for free on RDR. The storage quota applies to the first KU Leuven author of the dataset.  \nThe costs of storing the data on KU Leuven’s cold stora ge solution are not communicated yet, but are \nexpected to be less than 35 euro per year.  \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   15 \n 6. Data Sharing and Reuse  \n \nWill the data (or part of the data) be made \navailable for reuse after/during the project?   \nPlease explain per dataset or data type which \ndata will be made available.   \n \nNOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA \nSET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILA BLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE \nMAY APPLY .

In first instance, only the researchers involved in the research project will get access to the collected data. \nIn case the data is only gathered during my FWO postdo ctoral fellowship, the data is only accessible by \nme, prof. Dirk Saelens , Patricia Elsen (ATP) , and possibly master thesis students . In case complementary \nprojects will be funded in the future, the data will also be accessible to the involved research partners.  \nAfter the project, access can be given to other researchers to the pseudonymised data  after setting up a \ndata sharing agreement.  \nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the \nsharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in \nan agreement with a 3rd party, legal \nrestrictions)?

    "clean_full_text": "FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 1 FWO DMP Template - Flemish Standard Data Management Plan Project supervisors (from application round 2018 onwards) and fellows (from application round 2020 onwards) will, upon being awarded their project or fellowship, be invited to develop their answers to the data management related questions into a DMP. The F WO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.

If households are reluctant or unable to invest in technologies like electrical batteries to offer flexibility, they can participate acti vely in demand response (1) by continuous adapt ing behavior or (2) by changing the comfort requirements for smart appliances ’ or thermostats ’ controller. However, the energy flexibility potential of active participation in demand response is unclear. To es timate it, understanding, quantifying, and modeling households’ comfort elasticities – defined in this project as the relationship between changes in comfort requirements and energy costs – is needed . In this view, this project has 3 objectives. (1) Mixed methods case studies will enable understanding and quantifying diverse households’ comfort elasticities. (2) Active participation in residential demand response will be modeled using the quantified e lasticities . After implementing th at model in district energy system simulations (3) the energy flexibility potential of such active participation will be quantified.

If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type . Students will gather valuable data as part of the co urse ‘ Installaties in gebouwen: koeling en luchtbehandeling (B -KUL-H03Q0B) ’. These data will be used as part of the research. Moreover, some of the data gathered during my previous projects will be reused (i.e. PDM on the same topic and the oPEN Lab projec t). In the informed consent forms of these student works and projects, households agreed/will agree that the data could be (reused) for research. 5 These data are generated by combining multiple existing datasets. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 8 Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, please d escribe these issues further and refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. ☒ Yes, human subject data ☐ Yes, animal data ☐ Yes, dual use ☐ No If yes, please describe: All data gathered during the case studies deal with household behavior, energy demand and comfort, involving human subjects that participate voluntarily. They may include potentially vulnerable individuals or households. The data includes personal data. Furthermore, t hese data will be the basis for models of household behavior, which will be included in building simulations and a MPC framework. Approval from the Social and Societal Ethics Committee (SMEC) has been obtained through the PRET platform. Will you process personal data6? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use . Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate . If available, add the reference to your file in your host institution's privacy register. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes: - Short description of the kind of personal data that will be used: The following categories of personal data will be processed during the surveys and possibly the interviews: identification data (i.e. address, e -mail address, phone number and IP addresses), personal characteristics (i.e. age, birth sex/gender, marital sta tus, and nationality), financial data (i.e. salary data), consumption patterns, education and training, lifestyle and habits, family composition (i.e. number and characteristics of children (e.g. gender, age), and number of residents), and characteristics of individuals' dwelling (including drawings/plans of the dwelling) . Furthermore , recordings (i.e. audio recordings, video recordings, and photographs) will be made during the interviews . In addition, data that fall under the heading of ‘s pecial categories’ of personal data will also be processed. In particular, data providing information on racial or ethnic origin and data or a person's health (physical and mental , like stress and depression ) may be processed. 6 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9 The ICF will be kept separat ely from the other data . Personal identification data will be known only to the researchers directly involved and all data (except the audio recordings of the interviews , video recordings and plans, as indicated below ) will be pseudonymized as soon as poss ible and feasible . The codes used for pseudonymization will be stored in a different location from the data . In pseudonymi zation, it will be ensured that the different types of data collected from the same household can still be linked for integrated analysis. In transcripts, notes, names of files, on the surveys, etc., the actual names and addresses of participants will be replaced by pseudonyms. Faces of individuals in photographs will be made unrecogni zable and together with the plans, th ey will be kept. After all, i nformation included in the photos and plans is necessary if future researchers want to gain insight into the dwellings they are analy zing. Audio recordings will be deleted once transcribed. For video recordings , it will be asse ssed at the end of the research which of them are necessary to keep for future researchers . Note that during the research, p hotographs and other material with identifiable individuals will only be used for research purposes and edited for publications so that no individuals can be identified from these. However, it is possible that people familiar with participants' dwellings may recogni ze them based on descriptions, plans or pictures of them. - Privacy Registry Reference: G-2024 -8498 Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer , for example spin - offs, commercial exploitation, … )? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate . ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes , please comment : The TRL level of research results will still be too low to lead directly to commercial applications. However, the research may become part of future SBO, ICON, or Horizon 2020 projects, where commercial valori zation of the research results will take place. This valorizatio n may, for instance, focus on the development of interfaces that enable a two -way interaction between households and advanced controllers (e.g. MPC). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10 Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Mat erial/Data transfer agreements , research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). For each dataset described above a ReadMe file will be set up describing the data collection, processing (e.g. data cleaning) and analysis methods. For each of these stages of the data life cycle it will be described who did what, when, how and why. Moreover, information on the ethical approval (refer ence number and institution) will be given. Particularly for the data collection stage, a logbook will complement the ReadMe files, tracking information on the steps taken (e.g. placement of devices) and reasons for missing data. Missing data will be indic ated with NA in all data files. Additionally, general information on the ethical application and approval, informed consent example, the instructions we gave participants, a PDF of the questionnaires and interview guide, information about the sensors used, and information about the software used for the household behavior model, MPC framework and building simulations will be provided . Furthermore, at data level a codebook will be set up with an explanation of each of the variable labels , the labels assigned to values of variables and interview codes . This includes the measurement units of parameters that describe the indoor conditions and energy demands, production and storage, the unit of energy prices and costs, the question of the questionnaire that relat es to each of the variable labels in the corresponding datafile , an explanation of the labels assigned to values of variables of the FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11 questionnaire and their range , and an explanation of interview codes . The ReadMe files , logbook , general information and co debooks will be stored in the same folder as the ir corresponding data. For the household behavior model and the MPC framework, a code explanation will be given in the code itself, explaining each step. For these frameworks as well as the building simulation models, Git may be used as version control system. All datasets will be organized in folders in a structed way , with a clear file and folder naming. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : At the end of the research project, t he data will be stored on KU Leuven's institutional research data repository (RDR) in case others have indicated to be willing to reuse the data or KU Leuven’s cold storage solution when this is not the case . The corresponding recommended metadata model will be applied. If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Digital and audiovisual data will be stored on a secure network drive of KU Leuven (e.g. I - / J-drive) , only accessible to the researchers involved in the project . To share data with students, OneDrive linked to a KU Leuven account will be used. I f the students store the data on their personal computer f or data processing and analysis , they will be asked to delete the data at the end of their master thesis or after finishing the course in which they gathered and analyzed data. In case data is gathered at the oPEN Lab living lab or at Constructhor, these d ata will also be stored on a database maintained within EnergyVille, by KUL and VITO (MS Azure cloud). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12 Physical data will be stored w ithin KU Leuven , in the principal researcher’s office in a locked drawer or cabinet accessible only to the researcher . Whe n the FWO project will be complemented with other projects involving non -KU Leuven partners that need access to the data, the data will be moved to Man GO, or when these partners consist only of KU Leuven and VITO members, (also) the database maintained within EnergyVille. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS , STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGIT AL AND NON -DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH .7 REFER TO INSTITUTION -SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE . Files on the secure network drives of KU Leuven (e.g. I - / J-drive) and Man GO are automatically backed up. For the secure network drives of KU Leuven, backups are made using “snapshot” technology, which is the online storage of incremental data changes. For the standard backup regime, as specified below, 10% of the requested storag e capacity will be reserved . The standard backup regime is as follows: • An hourly backup (at 8 AM, 12 PM, 4 PM and 8 PM) the last 6 of which are stored on our servers • A daily backup, at midnight, the last 6 of which are stored on our servers • A weekly backup , Saturday night at midnight, the last 12 of which are stored on our servers The end user can use his own Windows PC to restore files to an older version using the “previous versions” function. According to the backup system above, it is possible to go bac k in time up to 12 weeks (~3 months) . Moreover, for the purpose of “business continuity” or “disaster recovery”, a mirror (exact copy) of all data is created in the second ICTS data centre. The data are copied every hour to the second data centre. In the event that the primary storage unit is corrupted, the ICTS team can get this copy online within the hour. The mirror in the second ICTS datacenter falls under type 1 storage . OneDrive also enables to restore files to an earlier version through the Version History or after deletion within 30 days through the Recycle Bin . Through Man GO, data is stored securely in the data centers of KU Leuven. Of each file, two copies are stored: one in the datacenter of Heverlee, and one in the datacenter of Leuven. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13 A scan of the physical data will be made and stored on a secure network drive of KU Leuven (e.g. I- / J- drive) as well. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: There is no storage limit on the shared network drives. Data shared with students is expected to be much less than 2 TB, the limi t of OneDrive. ManGO also does not have a storage limit . If no, please specify : How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 7 All ICT solutions at KU Leuven are subject to the university -wide ICT information security standards (e.g. multifactor authenticator) . Digital data will be stored in a restricted network share of t he secure network drives of KU Leuven (e.g. I - / J-drive) or ManGO . These drives and ManGO are therefore suitable for processing all types of personal data. When shared between researchers or students, v ideos and pictures will be encrypted using 7zip. A password will be set using Passwordstate . When OneD rive is used, only pseudonymized data will be stored online and the code list (link between the identifiable person and the code to which that person has been 'translated') is kept securely on a secure network drive of KU Leuven (e.g. I - / J-drive). Only p ersons involved in the research will get access to the data during the project (and possibly researchers involved in other funded complementary research projects) . Access to code files with pseudonyms is controlled by the principal researchers (with the P I and Patricia Elsen (ATP) as a back -up). What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Storage on the secure network drives of KU Leuven costs € 450,76 per TB per year. The necessary funding for storage and backup for the contracted service has been foreseen . OneDrive is Free for staff and students of KU Leuven. ManGO is also free of charge. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). After 10 years, it will be assessed whether it is necessary to keep all (personal) data or a part of it any longer. If necessary, a reminder date will be set at that time, when this will be reassessed. If f urther retention of all (personal) data or a part of it is no longer necessary, this will be deleted. An exception are the audio recordings, video recordings and photographs. Audio recordings will be deleted once transcribed. For video recordings , it will be assessed at the end of the research project (or complementary research projects) which of them are necessary to keep for future researchers . Faces of individuals in photographs will be made unrecogni zable at the end of the research project (or complementary research projects). Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? In case other researchers show interest in the data, t he data will be stored on KU Leuven's institutional research data repo sitory (RDR). However , as the collected data consist of personal data, it will only be shared after a data sharing agreement is set up. In case no interest is shown yet, it will be stored using KU Leuven’s cold storage solution. The paper data will be kept in the office of Patricia Elsen (ATP) in a locked drawer or cabinet that is only accessible to her and prof. Dirk Saelens. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? We expect that no costs will be associated with storing the data on RDR. Every researcher can store 50 GB per year for free on RDR. The storage quota applies to the first KU Leuven author of the dataset. The costs of storing the data on KU Leuven’s cold stora ge solution are not communicated yet, but are expected to be less than 35 euro per year. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 15 6.
