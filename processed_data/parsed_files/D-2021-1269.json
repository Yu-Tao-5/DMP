I will do this for multiple agricultural commodities (bananas, avocados, mangos, coffee, cocoa, quinoa and cassava)\nand multiple VSS over time. I will focus on the case of Peru due to the importance of agriculture for the countryâ€™s GDP and the\nlivelihoods of their population. I will use secondary panel data for the economic and social impact from the national household\nsurvey (ENAHO) collected by the Instituto Nacional de EstadÃ​stica e InformÃ¡tica and GIS data for the environmental impact from\nvarious online sources. This will be combined with certification data from the 32 standard-setting agencies that are active in Peru,\nwhich I will contact.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add the reference to your\nfile in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for Research and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe\naware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNo\nI will perform the analyses at district-level. Hence, no personal data is needed. I will do this by linking i) aggregated certification\ndata obtained from the certification agencies at district-level with ii) districts in the anominized data from the national household\nsurvey between 2004-2019 from the Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática, Peru.\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or\n \n \n \n \n \nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 3\nanimals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nNo\n \nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? Will IP\nrestrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If so, to what data\ndo they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nYes\nYes, I will contact the certification agencies to acquire data on certified farmers in Peru at district-level. In particular, I will request\nfor an anonymous list of certified producers in Peru for the period 2004-2019 for one of the following seven crops: banana,\navocado, mango, cacao, coffee, quinoa and cassava. Of the producers, I would like to know the crop(s) that are certified, the\ncertified area per certified crop, the year since when they have been certified, and the location of the producers (in the form of\nthe district of the farm). The data will probably be obtained using a data sharing agreement set up with my host university.\nIn addition, the Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática allows users of the online available data to publish the data.\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this project?\n1. For the data processing of the raw online available national household survey from the Instituto Nacional de Estadística e\nInformática (INEI), Peru, a document with the definition of the variables is already provided by the INEI. I will process the\nhousehold survey data in the scripted language software R and analyze it in the scripted langugage STATA to be able to track all\nchanges. In addition, I will continuously update a ReadMe file to describe the contents of my data files. This will allow a secondary\nresearcher to use the cleaned data accurately and effectively. \n2. For the data processing of the raw sattelite images, I will store the original raw data files in the cloud and at an external\nstorage place. In addition, I will continuously update a ReadMe file to describe all my processing files.\n3. For the data tha I will acquire from the certification agencies, I will save the original files in the cloud and at an external storage\nplace. Moreover, I will make a data dictionary and save the information on the data collection methodology in a ReadMe file.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be used. \nIf no, state in detail which\nmetadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse.\nYes\nYes, I will use the Data Documentation Initiative standard for the ReadMe files.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nDuring the research, the data will be stored at the university's central network drive (i.e. I-, J- and L-drive) (50 GB, 50 GB and 2\nTB). The I- drive is my personal drive. The J-drive is a secured and encrypted drive in accordance with KU Leuven’s IT Standards\nFramework which will be used for the confidential data. The L-drive is a personal drive for large datasets. This will be enough for\nthe estimated 10 GB of household data, 200 GB of satellite data and 5 GB of certification data. After the research, the data will be\nstored on the university's central network drive (i.e. K-drive) in which I will add a secured map with strict access.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic daily back-up procedures.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or\ninsufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nYes, the available storage capacity for the university's central network drive is 50GB for the personal I- and J-drive and 2 TB for\nthe personal L-drive (extra storage for large datasets)\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these costs be covered?\nFor most data repositories there are no extra costs. Whenever needed (e.g for additional external hard drives), the FWO bench\nfee will be used to cover the costs incurred.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized\npersons?\nThe data will be stored in the university's secure environment for private data with only controlled access possible and are\nsecured by the ICTS service of KU Leuven with a mirror copy.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a selection of\nthe data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical\npreservation issues, ...).\nYes, the data will be retained for a minimum period of 10 years according to te KU Leuven Research Data Management Policy.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for at least 10 years, conform the\nKU Leuven Research Data Management Policy.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be\ncovered?\nThere are no expected costs related to the storage of the foreseen size of the data.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 3\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement\nwith a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nYes. Specify:\nYes, I will contact the certification agencies to acquire data on certified farmers in Peru. However, to protect the privacy of the\nfarmers, we will ask for aggregated data at district-level, probably using a data sharing agreement with my host university.\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nI will share all my data files and metadocumentation (i.e. ReadMe files), possibly at a higher spatial scale, depending on the\narrangements that will be made with the certification bodies.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn an Open Access repository\nI aim to publish in open access journals to enhance the visibility of the research.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nImmediately after the end of the project\nThe data will be made available in the form of supplementary material of the Open Access articles.\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nThe full data of unpublished articles will be available upon request after the end of the project, provided that they give\nappropriate credit to the creators.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nFor most data repositories there are no extra costs. Whenever needed (e.g for additional external hard drives), the FWO bench\nfee will be used to cover the costs incurred.\n8. Responsibilities\nWho will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?\nI myself will be responsible for the data collection, documentation and metadata.\nWho will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nI myself will be responsible to store the data on the appropriate accommodation provided by KU Leuven. The ICTS service of KU\nLeuven is responsible for the back-up of the network drives at KU Leuven. \nWho will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ?\nI myself will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse.\nWho bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nI myself bear the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 3"
