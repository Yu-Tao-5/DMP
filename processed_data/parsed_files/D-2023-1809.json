Also, we copied FASTQ data in hard \ndrive in KU Leuven, with safety lock.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nWHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO \nPREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA \nAND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP \nDIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7\nREFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP \nPROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.To avoid data loss, we backed up FASTQ data on cloud server, managed by Genomic Core.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.☒ Yes\n☐ No\nIf yes, please specify concisely:  We have ~10TB hard drive to store data.\nIf no, please specify:  \n7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric:  https://osf.io/2z5g3/\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10How will you ensure that the data are securely \nstored and not accessed or modified by \nunauthorized persons?\nCLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, \nNETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND \nFILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND \nTRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7We only used cloud system managed by Genomic Core, under the permission from PI and \nonly used specific account generated by Genomic Core.So only restricted user can \naccess data, but only possible to download.  \nAlso, we downloaded and backed up data and it is already locked to use that.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?For the store of data, about 245euro per year, for 1 TB. We expected 8TB sufficiently,  \nto store all data generated as part of this project. These costs will be covered by \nthe budget of the principal investigator (Prof. Sabine Tejpar).\n5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five \nyears (or longer, in agreement with other \nretention policies that are applicable) after the \nend of the project? In case some data cannot be  \npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this  \n(e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All data will be stored the minimum preservation term of 5 years, after the end of the project.  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11Where will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long-term)?\nAfter publication, raw sequencing data will be deposited into an access-controlled public depository, for \nexample, European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA). Also for processed data (after anonymous) will be \ndeposited other depository, Synapse or Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).  \nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during the expected retention \nperiod? How will these costs be covered?That data is not actively worked after end of project, so cost will be reduced because it will be moved \ninto archival storage, not standard storage. So cost will be down and will be covered by the budget of \nProf. Sabine Tejpar.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 126.

STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: Document for each experiment will be stored in L-Drive (managed by KU Leuven), including sample keys, experimental condition, to ensure the reusability of the data. Also, computational analysis pipelines after generation of processed data (finishing anonymous step), will be stored using OneDrive, managed by KU Leuven IT department. 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9Where will the data be stored? We stored two systems. First, we generated FASTQ data from Genomic Core, and uploaded FASTQ & processed data on cloud server, only accessible to restricted users. Also, we copied FASTQ data in hard drive in KU Leuven, with safety lock. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.To avoid data loss, we backed up FASTQ data on cloud server, managed by Genomic Core. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: We have ~10TB hard drive to store data. If no, please specify: 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7We only used cloud system managed by Genomic Core, under the permission from PI and only used specific account generated by Genomic Core.So only restricted user can access data, but only possible to download. Also, we downloaded and backed up data and it is already locked to use that. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?For the store of data, about 245euro per year, for 1 TB. We expected 8TB sufficiently, to store all data generated as part of this project. These costs will be covered by the budget of the principal investigator (Prof. Sabine Tejpar). 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All data will be stored the minimum preservation term of 5 years, after the end of the project. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? After publication, raw sequencing data will be deposited into an access-controlled public depository, for example, European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA). Also for processed data (after anonymous) will be deposited other depository, Synapse or Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?That data is not actively worked after end of project, so cost will be reduced because it will be moved into archival storage, not standard storage. So cost will be down and will be covered by the budget of Prof. Sabine Tejpar. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 126. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☒ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: -Prior to publication, data sharing is restricted to members of the IMMUCAN consortium, already concluded a treaty. -After publication, For raw sequencing data, we will upload public depository as controlled access like EGA. It only allows restrict user after approval from host institution. -After publication, script for downstream analysis will be stored on public repository like GitHub. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Prior to publication, data sharing is only available to member of IMMUCAN consortium (concluded a treaty), and after publication, only allow user after getting approval from host institution. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☒ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify: As above, raw and processed data is restricted to member of IMMUCAN consortium. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.In Controlled access repository. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.Upon publication of the research results. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 Data from the project will be made available under a creative commons attribution license (CC-BY 4.0). Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes: What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? After publication, all data sharing is via public depository, so the cost will be free. Before publication, the cost will be covered the budget of Prof. Sabine Tejpar. 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 147.
