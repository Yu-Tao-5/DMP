The F WO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official  start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO \nbut to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of t he project by the relevant expert panel.  Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.  \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. T his \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives  of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contai ns the core \nrequirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a stan dardized glossary  of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.  \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   2 \n 1.

Our goal is to understand its pathogenesis for prevention strategies. We have \nmapped the immune landscapes in CD, id entifying a subpopulation of MMP9+ macrophages in the \nsubmucosal layer and creeping fat, linked to lipid metabolism and tissue remodeling, suggesting their role \nin fibrosis. We hypothesize that excessive fatty acids and lipids in the submucosa and creeping  fat are \ncleared by these macrophages, leading to a profibrotic phenotype. Our research, using advanced \nmethodologies, focuses on lipid -related pathways and MMP9+ macrophages to understand the \ndevelopment of fibrostenosis, aiming to develop anti -fibrotic t herapies for better CD management.  \n  \n \n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

The patient's name or other identifying \ninformation will be stored separately (site file) from their study data and replaced with a unique \ncode to keep the patient's identity secret. All personally identifiable information is replaced by a \nunique study ide ntifier for each patient and each biological sample. The subject identification log, \nlinking the identifiers to the participant’s name, will be only kept in the site’s regulatory binder and \nonly accessible by the treating physicians. Only the treating phys ician holds the code and can go back \nto the patient chart if results  obtained in the project would be of such medical importance that the \npatient’s health or disease status could be affected by not sharing this information . This is also clearly \nstipulated in the informed consent form. We will further stay in contact with Toon Boon for \noptimizing the strategy to deal with  these personal data.  \n \n- Privacy Registry Reference:  Ethical committee number s are : S53684  (frequent renewals will be  \nsubmitted)  \nDoes your work have potential for commercial \nvalorization (e.g. tech transfer , for example spin -\noffs, commercial exploitation, … )?  \nIf so, please comment per dataset  or data type \nwhere appropriate . ☒ Yes \n☐ No \nIf yes , please comment : There might be IP depending  on the obtained results.

Documentation and Metadata  \n \nClearly describe what approach will be followed \nto capture the accompanying information \nnecessary to keep data understandable and \nusable , for yourself and others, now and in the \nfuture (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and \ntypes required, procedures used, Electronic Lab \nNotebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. \nwhere this information is recorded ). \n Protocols and details related to data collection and processing will be recorded in Word or Excel  files. Data  \nfolders containing raw and processed data will be hierarchically organized and labelled  based on the  source \nof the data, the type of experiment, the date of data generation, and the  different experimental  conditions \nanalysed . Data analysis methods and particularities (including  metadata) will be described in  text documents \nand Excel files included in these folders. All files  will be stored in the J -Drive  or L drive  (KU Leven  Storage \nspace ). A readme  file containing lab notes, SOPs of animal models and proto cols to process the tissue, SOPs \nof human data and processing of human tissue  will always be kept together with the dataset.  The respective \ncentre responsible for collection and storage of human body material (UZ Leuven Biobank) and next -\ngeneration  sequencing (Genomics Core UZ Leuven) and lipidomics (Lipometrix) have implemented quality \nmanuals and quality control procedures available.  Readme files with information on methodology, an \noverview of the dataset, data sources, data collection methods, codebooks,  data cleaning, analysis, variable \ndefinitions , and, units of measurement will be provided. If any data transformation steps or workflows were \nutilized during the analysis, these would be also documented and shared. Detailed documentation of the \nanalysis methodology would be provided, including the sta tistical techniques, models, or algorithms \nemployed. We will use repositories in GitLab and GitHub which will also ensure reuse and version control.  \nThe provenance of the data be thoroughly documented using th e appropriate standards. The data will be \naccompanied by context on how they are captured, processed, analysed , and validated and other \ninformation that enables interpretation and re -use. \nAll personally identifiable information is replaced by a unique study identifier / Persistent Identifier for each \npatient and each biological sample. The subject identification log, linking the identifiers to the participant’s \nname, will be only kept in the site’s regulatory binder and only accessible by the treating physician s (Prof. \nSéverine Vermeire , UZ Leuven). This log will allow proper monitoring of the clinical records and by the \nappointed monitors to assure completeness, accuracy and correctness of the data collected at the site. \nClinical reports necessary for remote source data verification will be de -identified, coded with the personal \nidentifiers and electronically transmitted to the partners. No personally identifiable information will be at \nany time shared. Deposited datasets will be identified with a persistent identifier when applicable, such as \na DOI, both in preprint and publication.  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   13 \n Metadata that will be created includes but is not limited to image information, protocols, device \ninformation, data units, species taxon identifiers and gene identifiers.  We will use the Research Data \nRepository (RDR)  of KU Leuven (https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr) or European Genome -phenome \nArchive (EGA)(https://ega -archive.org/). A metadata standard is automatically applied upon depositing the \ndata. The metadata model  will include fields that are required, recommended and optional. Using this data \nrepository, the data sets will be findable and reusable. We will follow the applicable standard FAIR \nprinciples, Findable -Accessible -Interoperable -Reusable, mentioned in fairsharing.org. Keywords are \nprovided through the RDR repository system and EGA reposito ry system. The assignation of keywords to \neach dataset and subsets will facilitate their re -use. We will try to balance the trade -off between keywords \nthat are very specific to increase findability, but also more generalized so that it can be found in broa der \nsearches.  \nAfter uploading a file, the RDR repository gives the option to add a ReadMe file and add 'file metadata' to \neach file. The metadata in RDR is always publicly available after the reviewer has approved the dataset, even \nwith restricted or embargoed files. Me tadata makes our dataset findable and is therefore essential to make \nour data FAIR. The metadata deposited in EGA can also be harvested and indexed.  \nUpon the completion of the project, the data will be made freely available in the public domain  with \nrestricted access for data from patients and human tissues . For storage and sharing, we will ensure \ncompliance with GDPR, and will use trusted European repositories such as RDR or EGA.  Metadata will be \nmade openly available and licensed under a public domain dedication open licenses (Creative Commons \nAttribution International Public License (CC BY)).   \nWill a metadata standard be used to make it \neasier to find and reuse the data ?  \n \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard \nwill be used. If not, please specify which \nmetadata will be created to make the data \neasier to find and reuse.  \n \nREPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN \nFORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. \nSTANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☒ Yes \n☐ No \nIf yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used:   \nWe will use the RDR (https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr) data repository of KU Leuven or European \nGenome -phenome Archive (EGA; (https://ega -archive.org/). /) and we will restrict access for data from \npatients and human tissue. We will contact the data access committee (dac@uzleuven.be) before \ndepositing. At the end of the project, the data may be also deposited in domain specific domain -specific \nrepositories  such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). RDR \nuses digital  object identifier (DOI). EGA also provides the submitters with stable, globally unique identifiers \nto enable reference of datasets in publications and across genomics infrastructures.  A metadata standard is \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   14 \n  \n  automatically applied upon depositing the data . We will follow community -endorsed interoperability best \npractices that are relevant to our discipline. The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) \nprinciples will be followed to make data findable using persistent identifiers, which will ensure data \naccessibility and reusability with clear and standardized metadata, through open licenses and data formats  \n(https://fairsharing.org/  )  \nExample:  \nSequencing : MINISEQE (  https://fairsharing.org/MINSEQE 2 ) \nFlow cytometry: MIFlowCyt (  https://fairsharing.org/MIFlowCyt  ) \nImmunohistochemistry: OME ( https://fairsharing.org/OME ) \nSpatial trancriptomics:  Matrix Market (.mtx) format  \nBulk lipidomics:   mzTab  \n \nThe metadata model will include fields that are required, recommended , and optional. Using this data \nrepository, the data sets will be findable and reusable.  \nAll descriptors will be given in a language that can be understood across multiple disciplines to reach the \nbroader scientific community. Data will be deposited in a standard format that is commonly accepted and \nable  which can be accessible to everyone.  We will use shared vocabularies and ontologies to promote data \ninteroperability.   In the case of usage of uncommon or generated  project -specific  ontologies or vocabularies, \nclear descriptions and easily accessible mappings to more commonly used ontologies wi ll be provided.  The \ngenerated ontologies or vocabularies will be openly published to allow reusing, refining or extending them.  \nThe references will  also be included wherever applicable in a standardized and acceptable manner.  \nText documents and Excel files stored within each experiment folder in the J -Drive  or L -Drive  will \nrespectively contain guidelines describing data collection/analysis methods and all relevant  metadata  \n(including experimental conditions, sample keys, computational analysis pipelines and  their parameters) to \nensure the reusability of the data and the reproducibility of any further data  generation.  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   15 \n  \n7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric:  https://osf.io/2z5g3/  4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project  \n \nWhere will the data be stored?  Upon data collection/pre -processing, data will be stored in the J -Drive  or L-Drive  of our  research unit. These \nservers are centrally managed by ICTS KU Leuven and ha ve back -up capacities (KU Leuven enterprise box,  \nLarge  volume -storage) . Temporary copies of the data will be made and kept on personal hard drives  if \nnecessary . Metadata will be made openly available and licensed under a public domain dedication open \nlicenses (Creative Commons Attribution International Public License (CC BY)).  \nBoth EGA and RDR ensures long term storage. KU Leuven RDR ensures storage for at least 10 years. \nHowever, it is possible to request that the data be kept for a longer period of time (such as 20 -25 years for \nmedical fields). FAIR principle A2 states that me tadata should persist even when the data are no longer \nsustained. In addition, data will be available in easily accessible form, e.g., pdf, excel files. Relevant software \nand coding details will made available via the use of repository such as GitLab and G itHub, which will also \nensure reuse and version control.  \nHow will the data be backed up?  \n \nWHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO \nPREVENT DATA LOSS ? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS , STORAGE MEDIA AND \nPROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP \nDIGITAL AND NON -DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH .7 \n \nREFER TO INSTITUTION -SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP \nPROCEDURES  WHEN APPROPRIATE . Data stored on the KU Leuven J -Drive  and L -Drive  is managed, maintained, and backed up by KU Leuven IT  \nServices  (ICTS ). Specifically, mirror copies of the stored data are made immediately upon upload for  \nsafety backup purposes.   Both EGA and RDR ensures long term storage. KU Leuven RDR ensures storage \nfor at least 10 years. However, it is possible to request that the data be kept for a longer period of time . \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities  are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.  ☒ Yes \n☐ No \nIf yes, please specify concisely:  Yes, the KU Leuven J -Drive and L -Drive has sufficient storage capacity for \nthe outlined project.  \n \nIf no, please specify :  \nHow will you ensure that the data are securely \nstored and not accessed or modified by \nunauthorized persons?  The EGA provides a web -based portal and an API to enable data controllers to manage data access and \ntransfer permissions. Authorization infrastructure (AAI) management is vital for operating the EGA, where \na user's identity is verified before confirming ac cess rights to particular information. When a researcher logs \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   16 \n  \n \n  \nCLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , \nNETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND \nFILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND \nTRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 7 \n into the EGA website to access sensitive metadata, their credentials are authenticated. They can then \nbrowse a dataset of interest and request the download of sensitive data. If the researcher is permitted to \naccess the dataset after the EGA validates thei r request, the request is approved, and they can retrieve the \ndata.  Regarding the data of patients or human tissue samples, the patient's name or other identifying \ninformation will be stored separately (site file) from their study data and replaced with a unique code to \nkeep the patient's identity secret. The subject identification log, linking the identifiers to the participant’s \nname, will be kept in the site’s regulatory binder and only accessible by the treating physician. Clinical \nreports necessary for  remote source data verification will be de -identified, coded with the personal \nidentifiers and electronically transmitted to the partners. No personally identifiable information will be at \nany time shared.  \nFor personal data deposited in EGA and RDR that are not publicly accessible, access can be requested via \nthe designated data access committee.  \nData stored on KU Leuven -managed personal computers are protected via password access to  the \ncomputers, as set up by the KU Leuven IT Department. Off -site access to J -Drive  and L -Drive  data is  available  \nfrom KU Leuven personal computers and data access points and is password protected.  Upon request, \naccess to the shared drive will be given only to authorized researchers.  \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?  The annual cost of J -Drive storage is €519 and L -Drive is €1 13.84 per 1TB of storage space per year. This  \ncost and  capacity include the performance of mirror copies of the stored data, for safety backup purposes.  \nWe expect that 5 TB will be sufficient to store all data generated as part of the project. These  costs will be \ncovered by the budget of the project lead  (Prof. Gianluca Matteoli).  \n5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject  \n \nWhich data will be retained for at least five \nyears (or longer, in agreement with other \nretention policies that are applicable) after the All raw data will be retained for at least 5 years on the K -Drive storage space.

The access for data from human tissue  will be restrict ed. \n end of the  project? In case some data cannot be \npreserved , clearly state the reasons for this  \n(e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). As stated in the ICF, all data are anonymized. These will be also preserved for the 5 -year period after end of  \nthis project. The generated data will be stored on designated KUL servers. Only in case of findings which  \nhave direct implications for the health or disease status of the patient, the princip al investigator has the  \ncode to go back to the original patient, as also stipulated in the ICF. This code is stored on the hospital UZ  \nserver which is password protected and which also allows to consult the ele ctronic medical chart of the  \npatient stored on UZ Leuven Hospital servers.  Also, Both EGA and RDR ensures long term storage. KU Leuven \nRDR ensures storage for at least 10 years. However, it is possible to request that the data be kept for a \nlonger period of time . \n \nWhere will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long -term)?  Long term data archives will be maintained in specific archive folders on the K -Drive.  With the server  \ncentrally managed by the ICTS , we will use the back -up possibilities as proposed by KU Leuven ICTS .  \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during the expected retention \nperiod? How will these costs be covered?  The annual cost of K -Drive storage is €5.69  per 100GB of storage space per year. We expect  that 5 TB  will \nbe sufficient for long -term storage of all data generated as part of the project.  These costs will be covered \nby the budget of the project lead (Prof. Gianluca Matteoli ). \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   18 \n If access is restricted, please specify who will be \nable to access the data and under what \nconditions.

Any \nuser can place  reasonable requests data  for non -commercial purposes, and these requests will be assessed \non a  case -by-case basis by the project  lead (Prof. Gianluca Matteoli). Commercial -based requests will  be \ndiscussed with the project lead as well.  \n \nFurthermore, the EGA offers a web -based portal and an API to allow data controllers to manage data access \nand transfer permissions. Authorization  infrastructure (AAI) management is a key for operating the EGA \nwhere the identity of a user is verified before confirming the access rights to specific information. When a \nresearcher signs in to the EGA website to access sensitive metadata, their credenti als are authenticated to \nverify their identity. Then they can navigate to a dataset of interest and request dow nload of the sensitive \ndata. After the EGA validate their request against the permissions assigned to their identity, if the researcher \nhas permission to access the dataset, the request is authorised, and they can download the data . \n \nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the \nsharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in \nan agreement with a 3rd party, legal \nrestrictions)?

The F WO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of t he project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. T his Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contai ns the core requirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a stan dardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.

Our goal is to understand its pathogenesis for prevention strategies. We have mapped the immune landscapes in CD, id entifying a subpopulation of MMP9+ macrophages in the submucosal layer and creeping fat, linked to lipid metabolism and tissue remodeling, suggesting their role in fibrosis. We hypothesize that excessive fatty acids and lipids in the submucosa and creeping fat are cleared by these macrophages, leading to a profibrotic phenotype. Our research, using advanced methodologies, focuses on lipid -related pathways and MMP9+ macrophages to understand the development of fibrostenosis, aiming to develop anti -fibrotic t herapies for better CD management. 1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

Dr. Severine Vermeire . Tissue samples representative of no n- affected mucosa (resected margins), inflamed and stenotic areas will be identified und er the supervision of a trained IBD pathologist (UZ Leuven) and lysed to generate single nuclei suspensions for snRNA -seq or embedded to perform immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence or spatial transcriptomics . In addition, healthy and ileal full thickness biopsies will be collected during right hemicolectomy for CRC and will be used as control. These biological samples are being collected under the umbrella biobanking project s53684 (CCare PI: Prof. S; Vermeire). Overall, h ealth data such as disease severity and disease status of the collected samples will be recorded. - Animal Ethics Committee (ECD) KU Leuven Animal experiments will be performed as part of this project.

Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). Protocols and details related to data collection and processing will be recorded in Word or Excel files. Data folders containing raw and processed data will be hierarchically organized and labelled based on the source of the data, the type of experiment, the date of data generation, and the different experimental conditions analysed . Data analysis methods and particularities (including metadata) will be described in text documents and Excel files included in these folders. All files will be stored in the J -Drive or L drive (KU Leven Storage space ). A readme file containing lab notes, SOPs of animal models and proto cols to process the tissue, SOPs of human data and processing of human tissue will always be kept together with the dataset. The respective centre responsible for collection and storage of human body material (UZ Leuven Biobank) and next - generation sequencing (Genomics Core UZ Leuven) and lipidomics (Lipometrix) have implemented quality manuals and quality control procedures available. Readme files with information on methodology, an overview of the dataset, data sources, data collection methods, codebooks, data cleaning, analysis, variable definitions , and, units of measurement will be provided. If any data transformation steps or workflows were utilized during the analysis, these would be also documented and shared. Detailed documentation of the analysis methodology would be provided, including the sta tistical techniques, models, or algorithms employed. We will use repositories in GitLab and GitHub which will also ensure reuse and version control. The provenance of the data be thoroughly documented using th e appropriate standards. The data will be accompanied by context on how they are captured, processed, analysed , and validated and other information that enables interpretation and re -use. All personally identifiable information is replaced by a unique study identifier / Persistent Identifier for each patient and each biological sample. The subject identification log, linking the identifiers to the participant’s name, will be only kept in the site’s regulatory binder and only accessible by the treating physician s (Prof. Séverine Vermeire , UZ Leuven). This log will allow proper monitoring of the clinical records and by the appointed monitors to assure completeness, accuracy and correctness of the data collected at the site. Clinical reports necessary for remote source data verification will be de -identified, coded with the personal identifiers and electronically transmitted to the partners. No personally identifiable information will be at any time shared. Deposited datasets will be identified with a persistent identifier when applicable, such as a DOI, both in preprint and publication. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13 Metadata that will be created includes but is not limited to image information, protocols, device information, data units, species taxon identifiers and gene identifiers. We will use the Research Data Repository (RDR) of KU Leuven (https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr) or European Genome -phenome Archive (EGA)(https://ega -archive.org/). A metadata standard is automatically applied upon depositing the data. The metadata model will include fields that are required, recommended and optional. Using this data repository, the data sets will be findable and reusable. We will follow the applicable standard FAIR principles, Findable -Accessible -Interoperable -Reusable, mentioned in fairsharing.org. Keywords are provided through the RDR repository system and EGA reposito ry system. The assignation of keywords to each dataset and subsets will facilitate their re -use. We will try to balance the trade -off between keywords that are very specific to increase findability, but also more generalized so that it can be found in broa der searches. After uploading a file, the RDR repository gives the option to add a ReadMe file and add 'file metadata' to each file. The metadata in RDR is always publicly available after the reviewer has approved the dataset, even with restricted or embargoed files. Me tadata makes our dataset findable and is therefore essential to make our data FAIR. The metadata deposited in EGA can also be harvested and indexed. Upon the completion of the project, the data will be made freely available in the public domain with restricted access for data from patients and human tissues . For storage and sharing, we will ensure compliance with GDPR, and will use trusted European repositories such as RDR or EGA. Metadata will be made openly available and licensed under a public domain dedication open licenses (Creative Commons Attribution International Public License (CC BY)). Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: We will use the RDR (https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr) data repository of KU Leuven or European Genome -phenome Archive (EGA; (https://ega -archive.org/). /) and we will restrict access for data from patients and human tissue. We will contact the data access committee (dac@uzleuven.be) before depositing. At the end of the project, the data may be also deposited in domain specific domain -specific repositories such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). RDR uses digital object identifier (DOI). EGA also provides the submitters with stable, globally unique identifiers to enable reference of datasets in publications and across genomics infrastructures. A metadata standard is FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14 automatically applied upon depositing the data . We will follow community -endorsed interoperability best practices that are relevant to our discipline. The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles will be followed to make data findable using persistent identifiers, which will ensure data accessibility and reusability with clear and standardized metadata, through open licenses and data formats (https://fairsharing.org/ ) Example: Sequencing : MINISEQE ( https://fairsharing.org/MINSEQE 2 ) Flow cytometry: MIFlowCyt ( https://fairsharing.org/MIFlowCyt ) Immunohistochemistry: OME ( https://fairsharing.org/OME ) Spatial trancriptomics: Matrix Market (.mtx) format Bulk lipidomics: mzTab The metadata model will include fields that are required, recommended , and optional. Using this data repository, the data sets will be findable and reusable. All descriptors will be given in a language that can be understood across multiple disciplines to reach the broader scientific community. Data will be deposited in a standard format that is commonly accepted and able which can be accessible to everyone. We will use shared vocabularies and ontologies to promote data interoperability. In the case of usage of uncommon or generated project -specific ontologies or vocabularies, clear descriptions and easily accessible mappings to more commonly used ontologies wi ll be provided. The generated ontologies or vocabularies will be openly published to allow reusing, refining or extending them. The references will also be included wherever applicable in a standardized and acceptable manner. Text documents and Excel files stored within each experiment folder in the J -Drive or L -Drive will respectively contain guidelines describing data collection/analysis methods and all relevant metadata (including experimental conditions, sample keys, computational analysis pipelines and their parameters) to ensure the reusability of the data and the reproducibility of any further data generation.

Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Upon data collection/pre -processing, data will be stored in the J -Drive or L-Drive of our research unit. These servers are centrally managed by ICTS KU Leuven and ha ve back -up capacities (KU Leuven enterprise box, Large volume -storage) . Temporary copies of the data will be made and kept on personal hard drives if necessary . Metadata will be made openly available and licensed under a public domain dedication open licenses (Creative Commons Attribution International Public License (CC BY)). Both EGA and RDR ensures long term storage. KU Leuven RDR ensures storage for at least 10 years. However, it is possible to request that the data be kept for a longer period of time (such as 20 -25 years for medical fields). FAIR principle A2 states that me tadata should persist even when the data are no longer sustained. In addition, data will be available in easily accessible form, e.g., pdf, excel files. Relevant software and coding details will made available via the use of repository such as GitLab and G itHub, which will also ensure reuse and version control. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS , STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON -DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH .7 REFER TO INSTITUTION -SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE . Data stored on the KU Leuven J -Drive and L -Drive is managed, maintained, and backed up by KU Leuven IT Services (ICTS ). Specifically, mirror copies of the stored data are made immediately upon upload for safety backup purposes. Both EGA and RDR ensures long term storage. KU Leuven RDR ensures storage for at least 10 years. However, it is possible to request that the data be kept for a longer period of time . Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: Yes, the KU Leuven J -Drive and L -Drive has sufficient storage capacity for the outlined project. If no, please specify : How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The EGA provides a web -based portal and an API to enable data controllers to manage data access and transfer permissions. Authorization infrastructure (AAI) management is vital for operating the EGA, where a user's identity is verified before confirming ac cess rights to particular information. When a researcher logs FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 16 CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 7 into the EGA website to access sensitive metadata, their credentials are authenticated. They can then browse a dataset of interest and request the download of sensitive data. If the researcher is permitted to access the dataset after the EGA validates thei r request, the request is approved, and they can retrieve the data. Regarding the data of patients or human tissue samples, the patient's name or other identifying information will be stored separately (site file) from their study data and replaced with a unique code to keep the patient's identity secret. The subject identification log, linking the identifiers to the participant’s name, will be kept in the site’s regulatory binder and only accessible by the treating physician. Clinical reports necessary for remote source data verification will be de -identified, coded with the personal identifiers and electronically transmitted to the partners. No personally identifiable information will be at any time shared. For personal data deposited in EGA and RDR that are not publicly accessible, access can be requested via the designated data access committee. Data stored on KU Leuven -managed personal computers are protected via password access to the computers, as set up by the KU Leuven IT Department. Off -site access to J -Drive and L -Drive data is available from KU Leuven personal computers and data access points and is password protected. Upon request, access to the shared drive will be given only to authorized researchers. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The annual cost of J -Drive storage is €519 and L -Drive is €1 13.84 per 1TB of storage space per year. This cost and capacity include the performance of mirror copies of the stored data, for safety backup purposes. We expect that 5 TB will be sufficient to store all data generated as part of the project. These costs will be covered by the budget of the project lead (Prof. Gianluca Matteoli). 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the All raw data will be retained for at least 5 years on the K -Drive storage space. Publication data will be further organized and catalogued on a figure -by-figure basis for future reference to raw datasets used for figure generation . FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 17 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE , CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY . AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS . FOR MORE INFORMATION : HTTPS ://WIKI.SURFNET .NL/DISPLAY /STANDARDS /INFO-EU- REPO /#INFOEUREPO -ACCESS RIGHTS ☒ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☒ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: All the data that will be published as a part of the project will be made available. For storage and sharing, we will ensure compliance with GDPR, and will use trusted European repositories such as RDR (https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr) or EGA ( https://ega -archive.org/ ). Metadata will be made openly available and licensed under a public domain dedication open licenses (Creative Commons Attribution International Public License (CC BY)). The access for data from human tissue will be restrict ed. end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). As stated in the ICF, all data are anonymized. These will be also preserved for the 5 -year period after end of this project. The generated data will be stored on designated KUL servers. Only in case of findings which have direct implications for the health or disease status of the patient, the princip al investigator has the code to go back to the original patient, as also stipulated in the ICF. This code is stored on the hospital UZ server which is password protected and which also allows to consult the ele ctronic medical chart of the patient stored on UZ Leuven Hospital servers. Also, Both EGA and RDR ensures long term storage. KU Leuven RDR ensures storage for at least 10 years. However, it is possible to request that the data be kept for a longer period of time . Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? Long term data archives will be maintained in specific archive folders on the K -Drive. With the server centrally managed by the ICTS , we will use the back -up possibilities as proposed by KU Leuven ICTS . What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The annual cost of K -Drive storage is €5.69 per 100GB of storage space per year. We expect that 5 TB will be sufficient for long -term storage of all data generated as part of the project. These costs will be covered by the budget of the project lead (Prof. Gianluca Matteoli ). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 18 If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Data not deposited in open -access repositories will in principle only be accessible to members of Prof. Matteoli ’s lab. Other collaborations and sharing are possible with staff within the Inflammatory Bowel Disease research group and Center of Neuro -immune interactions at TARGID, upon reasonable request. Any user can place reasonable requests data for non -commercial purposes, and these requests will be assessed on a case -by-case basis by the project lead (Prof. Gianluca Matteoli). Commercial -based requests will be discussed with the project lead as well. Furthermore, the EGA offers a web -based portal and an API to allow data controllers to manage data access and transfer permissions. Authorization infrastructure (AAI) management is a key for operating the EGA where the identity of a user is verified before confirming the access rights to specific information. When a researcher signs in to the EGA website to access sensitive metadata, their credenti als are authenticated to verify their identity. Then they can navigate to a dataset of interest and request dow nload of the sensitive data. After the EGA validate their request against the permissions assigned to their identity, if the researcher has permission to access the dataset, the request is authorised, and they can download the data . Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☒ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No All personally identifiable information is replaced by a unique study identifier for each patient and each biological sample. The subject identification log, linking the identifiers to the participant’s name, will be only kept in the site’s regulatory bind er and only accessible by the treating physician s (Prof. Séverine Vermeire , UZ Leuven). This log will allow proper monitoring of the clinical records and by the appointed monitors to assure completeness, accuracy and correctness of the data collected at the site. Clinical reports necessary for remote source data verification will be de -identified, coded with the personal identifiers and electronically transmitted to the partners. No personally identifiable information will be at any time shared. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 19 Where will the data be made available?
