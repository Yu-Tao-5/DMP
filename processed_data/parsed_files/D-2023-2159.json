The prevalence rate of objective arm or trunk/ breast BCRL is declining due to the major shift\ninto the treatment approach of breast cancer. However, prevalence rate of subjective arm or trunk/ breast BCRL is much\nhigher than that of objective BCRL. Subjective BCRL is defined as the diagnosis of BCRL based on the patient’s sensation\nof a difference in size at the arm and/or trunk without any objectively measurable swelling. At this moment, it is not\nclear how many breast cancer patients experience subjective arm or trunk/ breast BCRL and what the underlying\nmechanisms may be.\nWe hypothesize that four mechanisms might be associated with the presence and the severity of subjective arm or\ntrunk/ breast BCRL, including sensory processing problems (1. nociceptive and/or 2. neuropathic and/or 3. central) and\nthe presence of disturbed lymphatic transport without clinical manifestation (4. subclinical BCRL).\nTo understand who and why patients after breast cancer treatment report subjective arm or trunk/ breast BCRL, a multi-\ncenter longitudinal study will be performed. This will be the first study investigating in 230 breast cancer patients the\nprevalence rate and underlying mechanisms of subjective arm or trunk/ breast BCRL at different time points (starting\npre-surgery up to 12 months post-surgery), using state-of-the art and innovative assessment methods for both different\ntypes of BCRL and their underlying mechanisms.\nLast modified: \n25-06-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

The backups and snapshots are retained for a period of 14 days.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nYes, the KU Leuven provides hosting for the REDcap application and will provide sufficient storage\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nAuthentication is based on a personal username and password, using the KU Leuven's Active directory server for authentication. Authorisation in REDcap is granted on a\nproject basis through REDcap's internal authorisation mechanism.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nData are stored in REDcap. The costs for the hosting and licence for REDcap are covered by the university. A yearly fee per project is paid with project funding.\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the\nproject? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues,\ninstitutional policies...).\nAll data will be stored for a period of 25 years in REDcap. If the application will be taken out of commission before this period and without a datamigration to a new\nplatform, data will be exported to ODM XML,  an XML format for exchanging and archiving clinical data, associated metadata and audit information.\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nThe data will be stored in REDcap, which is hosted in the datacenter of the KU Leuven. Should the application be taken out of commission, the data will be exported to\nODM XML and stored in a secure archive or file server.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period?

The prevalence rate of objective arm or trunk/ breast BCRL is declining due to the major shift into the treatment approach of breast cancer. However, prevalence rate of subjective arm or trunk/ breast BCRL is much higher than that of objective BCRL. Subjective BCRL is defined as the diagnosis of BCRL based on the patient’s sensation of a difference in size at the arm and/or trunk without any objectively measurable swelling. At this moment, it is not clear how many breast cancer patients experience subjective arm or trunk/ breast BCRL and what the underlying mechanisms may be. We hypothesize that four mechanisms might be associated with the presence and the severity of subjective arm or trunk/ breast BCRL, including sensory processing problems (1. nociceptive and/or 2. neuropathic and/or 3. central) and the presence of disturbed lymphatic transport without clinical manifestation (4. subclinical BCRL). To understand who and why patients after breast cancer treatment report subjective arm or trunk/ breast BCRL, a multi- center longitudinal study will be performed. This will be the first study investigating in 230 breast cancer patients the prevalence rate and underlying mechanisms of subjective arm or trunk/ breast BCRL at different time points (starting pre-surgery up to 12 months post-surgery), using state-of-the art and innovative assessment methods for both different types of BCRL and their underlying mechanisms.

Storage capacity/repository during and after the research: All data and document will be stored and organized with the electronic application REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). It is a web-based software and tool set that allows researchers to create secure online forms for data capture, management and analysis. It is already widely used in many academic medical centers. Data will be stored for at least 25 years. Data will be stored and automatically backed up in REDCap and the server of KU Leuven. The REDcap server is hosted and managed by the UKU Leuven ICT department. The data is backed up on a daily basis in addition to daily snapshots of the server. The backups and snapshots are retained for a period of 14 days. Authentication is based on a personal username and password, using the KU Leuven's Active directory server for authentication. Authorisation in redcap is granted on a project basis through REDcap's internal authorisation mechanism. All data will be stored for a period of 20/25 years in REDcap. If the application will be taken out of commission before this period and without a datamigration to a new platform, data will be exported to ODM XML, an XML format for exchanging and archiving clinical data, associated metadata and audit information.
