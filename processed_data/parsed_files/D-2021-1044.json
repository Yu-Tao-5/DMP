In response, numerous grassroots movements are testing new housing solutions.\nUrban studies, the interdisciplinary field concerned with the study of cities, has growing attention\nfor such grassroots practices, but currently tends to prioritize either a social or spatial approach,\nfailing to understand if and how grassroots struggles structurally contribute to the making of\nmore just cities. Because of the methodological and epistemological schism between social and\napplied sciences, and anthropology and architecture in particular, the distinct â€˜city-\nmakingâ€™ of grassroots movements remains invisible, hindering more emancipatory and\ncritical forms of urban theory and action. The main aim of this research is to advance critical\ncartography as an interdisciplinary tool to better understand grassroots crisis responses. The\noverarching research question is: what novel forms of reinhabiting, reimagining and remaking\nthe city emerge from grassroots struggles for housing? Through a case-study of Brussels and\ninternational collaboration, this study will analyze the interplay of homeless crises, grassroots\nmovements, and radical housing. By integrating typo-morphological analysis and collaborative\nethnography, the critical atlas will be the first in-depth urban scale examination of grassroots\nmovements. Data will include photography, maps, drawings, archival iconography, interviews\nand interview transcripts.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
