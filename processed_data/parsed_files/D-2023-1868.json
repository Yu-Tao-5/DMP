The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO \nbut to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.  \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template. \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.  \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  2 \n 1.

However, to cope with the \ndetrimental effects of antibiotics, bacteria have at their disposal a wide range of defense strategies. In \naddition to the well-known example of resistance, therapy failure can result from the presence of a subset \nof cells that have transiently switched to an antibiotic-tolerant “persister” state. We and others have \ndemonstrated that persister levels in vitro can be tuned to the frequency of antibiotic encounters by \ngenetic adaptation. We hypothesize that a similar evolutionary process may occur in vivo. To lend support \nto this hypothesis, we will study persistence in longitudinal bacterial isolates obtained from patients with \nsuprapubic catheters. Evolutionary trajectories of persistence will be charted and a postulated role for \nexposure to antibiotics as well as the composition of the microbiome on the evolution of persistence will \nbe investigated. Since persistence is a known driver of resistance development, evolution of resistance will \nalso be studied. Finally, mechanistic insights will be obtained into genes, regulatory networks and \nphysiological conditions that drive persistence and its evolution. Results from this project will be \nintegrated in a comprehensive model for persistence and its evolution in vivo. The latter is expected to \ncontribute to the rational development of future therapeutic approaches to clear bacterial infections.  \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  4 \n 2.

At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.

However, to cope with the detrimental effects of antibiotics, bacteria have at their disposal a wide range of defense strategies. In addition to the well-known example of resistance, therapy failure can result from the presence of a subset of cells that have transiently switched to an antibiotic-tolerant “persister” state. We and others have demonstrated that persister levels in vitro can be tuned to the frequency of antibiotic encounters by genetic adaptation. We hypothesize that a similar evolutionary process may occur in vivo. To lend support to this hypothesis, we will study persistence in longitudinal bacterial isolates obtained from patients with suprapubic catheters. Evolutionary trajectories of persistence will be charted and a postulated role for exposure to antibiotics as well as the composition of the microbiome on the evolution of persistence will be investigated. Since persistence is a known driver of resistance development, evolution of resistance will also be studied. Finally, mechanistic insights will be obtained into genes, regulatory networks and physiological conditions that drive persistence and its evolution. Results from this project will be integrated in a comprehensive model for persistence and its evolution in vivo. The latter is expected to contribute to the rational development of future therapeutic approaches to clear bacterial infections. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 4 2.

Documentation and Metadata FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 15 Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: Data files are named using \"yearmonthday_titleordescription\". The data are generated following standardized protocols that are saved in a OneNote notebook. To keep the data organised, day-by-day activities are registered in a detailed digital lab notebook in OneNote in which a page is made for each month and within such page the experiments are noted per day. BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL: The cryotubes of the collection of urine samples are labelled according to the accompanying database. Cryotubes containing the bacterial isolates and mutants are labelled with the date of storage and an identifier (e.g. PatientNr_VisitNr_StrainIdentifier). Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.
