In this proposal, we propose a detailed plan to gain insight into the degradation\nmechanism based on electrodeposition by 1) quantifying the critical deposition concentration of lithium sulfide that leads to cathode catalysts\ndeactivation; 2) controlling the nucleation and deposition orientation of lithium sulfide; 3) using this knowledge to solve the challenge issues in Li-S\nbatteries; 4) analyzing the data obtained in Work Packages 1 and 2 comprehensively to reveal universal rules for structure-activity correlation. Firstly,\nwe will explain why catalysts can be easily prepared by electrodeposition as cathode hosts, and others do not. Next, the key factors affecting catalysts'\ndeactivation and cell degradation will be disclosed. Then, different types of metal catalysts with suitable particle sizes will be developed that are highly\nactive and selective for Li-S pouch cells. Ultimately, extensive data analysis will be performed to visualize the data and discover generalized rules for\nstructure-activity correlation.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n20-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
