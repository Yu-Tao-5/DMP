The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions.

A novel MP method will\nbe investigated to increase the yield and selectivity in Li extraction from LIBs waste and achieve the\nseparation of Ni, Mn and Co (obj.1). An integrated process of selective electrodialysis and membrane\ncrystallization with tailored membranes/units will be designed to purify the metal-rich solutions\nproduced by MP, with the aim to identify process controlling parameters for maximal recovery of\nbattery-grade hydroxides of Li, Ni, Mn and Co (obj.2). A MP-assisted method will be developed to \nresynthesize NMC811 cathodes from the purified battery-material streams (Obj. 3). The performance\nof the as-obtained NMC811 as cathodes for LIBs will finally be demonstrated.

RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .The approach to capture the accompany information necessary to keep data understandable and usable is dependent on the types of data: 1.Data related to experimental design, testing conditions/settings and raw data, for example, Notes: The electronic lab notebook is used for setup design (sketches) and writing down of observations. This notebook will be stored in KU Leuven drives. Manuscripts: Communication of scientific results is done via manuscripts and saved in .docx, .pdf or .tex. Presentations: Presentations containing scientific results are produced using PowerPoint and stored accordingly (.ppt or .pdf). 2.Data related to analytical measurements, for example, Solution property measurements, e.g., ICP-OES: Samples are prepared according to SOPs and named \"name_D/C_time\". Observations and procedures are reported in a handwritten lab book and subsequently noted digitally (.docx, .xlsx). Data are received in .csv and .xlsx format. Microscopy Images: Pictures are taken according to SOPs, saved in .tiff and named \"name_type_conditions\", as the device settings are displayed on the pictures taken. ImageJ software can be used to analyze the images and produce particle size distributions with the use of MATLAB or origin software. Material elemental and structural measurements, e.g, Infrared Spectroscopy, XRD, etc: Samples are prepared according to SOPs and named \"name_type_conditions\". Observations and procedures are digitally reported in a lab notebook. After operation, physical liquid/solid samples are not stored but some imaging samples can be partially recuperated. 3.Data related to modelling or theoretical calculations, for example, These CFD models will be constructed using COMSOL software. For each model, multiple simulations files of .mph format will be generated with labelling (\"WPnumber_modelname_conditions\"). Moreover, .docx file will be made to accompany each model file and will contain all the simulation conditions and observations and .xlsx files for output plots and graphs. MATLAB Codes: These codes will be constructed using MATLAB software. For each workpackage that requires coding, different script files of .m format will be generated with labelling (\"WPnumber_modelname_correlationtype\"). Moreover, .docx file will be made to accompany each code FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10file and will contain all the simulation conditions and observations and .xlsx files for output plots and graphs. Thermodynamic simulations: These codes will be constructed using HSC Chemistry software. For each model, multiple simulations files of .HSC format will be generated with labelling (\"WPnumber_modelname_conditions\"). Moreover, .docx file will be made to accompany each model file and will contain all the simulation conditions and observations and .xlsx files for output plots and graphs. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.

The software indicates the update status (green, blue or red) and, in case of a nonsync, action can be taken using the online version of the tool. Data are further back up regularly on an external hard drive. After completion of (sub)WPs, data will be additionally backed up on the KUL service servers. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No Maximum data storage should not exceed 2 TB per project If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data The accesses to OneDrive and SharePoint are only for researchers with permission. All users need to use a two-factor Authenticator (2FA app used at KUL). Furthermore, a log-out is always performed when leaving Lab PCs (where data is generated) to prevent modification of parameters by unauthorized people. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?The estimated costs for data storage and back up during the project will not exceed 5000€. These costs will be covered and shared by both PIs of the project. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 125. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☐ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) All the data will be retained for the expected 5 years period after the end of the project with no exceptions.
