Currently, treatment resistance affects up to 61% of cases, with half of patients unable to return to their\npreferred sports or previous activity levels within 5 to 10 years of follow-up. This highlights the inadequacy of existing rehabilitation\nprograms, where exercise therapy is seen as the golden standard. Understanding the healthy behaviour of the Achilles tendon and ways\nto modify pathological tendon behaviour is crucial. The Achilles tendon consists of three subtendons, which slide relative to each other.\nReduced intra-tendinous sliding in pathological conditions and the potential to enhance this sliding through external foot positioning\nsuggest promoting healthier tendon behavior. However, to improve patients' return-to-sport rates, we must look beyond the rehabilitation\nprotocol itself. Considering the amount of physical activity patients engage in during and after the exercise therapy period is crucial, as\nit influences the tendon load as well. This proposal aims to: 1) investigate the effect of horizontal foot position on intra-tendinous sliding\nduring dynamic exercises in healthy individuals and patients with Achilles tendinopathy cross-sectionally and over an extended training\nprogram and 2) explore the impact of physical activity during and after this training program on these treatment outcomes.\nID: \nID: \n213320\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-11-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n31-10-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n31-03-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Version management is done using \"snapshot\" technology, where the previous versions of the changed files\nare kept online in a snapshot on the same storage system.\na. by default, 1 snapshot is taken daily and is kept for 14 days. So you can go back to previous versions of the file up to 14 days. \nb. end users can restore older files themselves from within their Windows PC via the \"previous versions | previous versions\"\nfunctionality. \nA mirror (an exact copy) of the data is provided in the second ICTS data center for “business continuity” or “disaster recovery”\npurposes; a file is copied to the second data center as soon as it is written to a drive. ICTS can put the copy online within an hour\nin case of disaster with the primary storage.\n2. REDCap. When using KU Leuven REDCap, data is backed up as follows: \na.

Project abstract: Project abstract: Achilles tendinopathy induces Achilles tendon pain and functional limitations, leading to physical discomfort and social withdrawal, ultimately reducing quality of life. Currently, treatment resistance affects up to 61% of cases, with half of patients unable to return to their preferred sports or previous activity levels within 5 to 10 years of follow-up. This highlights the inadequacy of existing rehabilitation programs, where exercise therapy is seen as the golden standard. Understanding the healthy behaviour of the Achilles tendon and ways to modify pathological tendon behaviour is crucial. The Achilles tendon consists of three subtendons, which slide relative to each other. Reduced intra-tendinous sliding in pathological conditions and the potential to enhance this sliding through external foot positioning suggest promoting healthier tendon behavior. However, to improve patients' return-to-sport rates, we must look beyond the rehabilitation protocol itself. Considering the amount of physical activity patients engage in during and after the exercise therapy period is crucial, as it influences the tendon load as well. This proposal aims to: 1) investigate the effect of horizontal foot position on intra-tendinous sliding during dynamic exercises in healthy individuals and patients with Achilles tendinopathy cross-sectionally and over an extended training program and 2) explore the impact of physical activity during and after this training program on these treatment outcomes.

Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes From the data collected in WP2, we will have data about the load applied on the Achilles tendon during walking and other dynamic exercises in 50 patients. This could be transferred to an online application. By collection the type and amount of physical activity per day via an activity tracker and relating this to the experimental data collected in the lab, an overall load index per day could be given to the participant. This kind of information can be shared with their physiotherapist to adapt the training program if necessary. This was also written down in the FWO proposal of the project. However, nothing of this is already start up and the new application would be made if results look promising. As the research has already experience with inventing applications, I'm convinced we're in contact with good people to make this work.

Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? KU Leuven network drive, specifically L-drive. Automatic version management of the files occurs when storing data in the KU Leuven datacenters. Version management is done using \"snapshot\" technology, where the previous versions of the changed files are kept online in a snapshot on the same storage system. a. by default, 1 snapshot is taken daily and is kept for 14 days. So you can go back to previous versions of the file up to 14 days. b. end users can restore older files themselves from within their Windows PC via the \"previous versions | previous versions\" functionality. A mirror (an exact copy) of the data is provided in the second ICTS data center for “business continuity” or “disaster recovery” purposes; a file is copied to the second data center as soon as it is written to a drive. ICTS can put the copy online within an hour in case of disaster with the primary storage. 2. REDCap. When using KU Leuven REDCap, data is backed up as follows: a. The web server backup regime is specified below: i. An hourly backup, the last 6 versions of which are saved ii. A daily backup, the last 7 versions of which are saved iii. A weekly backup, the last 6 versions of which are saved b. The database backup regime is specified below: i. A nightly cold backup of all databases ii. One month’s storage of the nightly cold backups c. Data restore, upon request 3. To ensure that the master file remains up-to-date the FreeFileSync tool will be used for regular synchronization of active copies to the L-drive. How will the data be backed up?

How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? 1. KU Leuven network drive, specifically L-drive. The KU Leuven network drives are incorporated within secured KU Leuven environments, are password-protected (including smartphone-based multi-factor identification) and are only accessible by registered collaborating researchers. Only the PI can request access to the network drive for study personnel. 2. REDCap. When using KU Leuven REDCap, physical access to the data centers is logged and restricted to authorized KU Leuven Information Technology (IT) personnel, using badge identification. At the clinical database level only study team members, monitors and auditors/inspectors for whom the Coordinating or Principal Investigator (as applicable) has requested project- specific access, are granted data access. Upon successful training completion each user is centrally assigned a user role, associated with predefined system/data privileges, in accordance with CR DM-WI-001.

The L-drive costs € 95.14 / TB / year. Our dataset is estimated at XX TB and the project will run for X years, resulting in a total cost of € XX. The department of Movement Sciences provides an L-drive of 20TB. As such, costs will be covered by the department. In case of insufficient storage (as the drive is shared by several projects), the drive can be extended. Additional costs could be covered by the FWO bench fee. 2. REDCap.
