The electrical signals are generated at the cell\nmembrane level, and their collective behavior at the mesoscale will determine normal or abnormal heart rhythm. The bridging across spatial scales is\nusually performed by massive numerical simulation of a large set of coupled non-linear PDEs. However, the precise non-linear terms herein will differ\nbetween and even within hearts. The exact form and parameters of the classical equations for a given patient are currently impossible to find.  \nWe propose instead a minimal phenomenological model based on the typical excitation cycle and memory effects. A phase-amplitude representation of\nthe state-space manifold produces a Ginzburg-Landau style phase equation, which can be truncated at any desired order. The new model will be fit to\nin-silico models and recordings of excitation patterns. Symbolic regression is used to validate it against, or extend towards, measured patterns. Difficult\nregimes such as alternans and afterdepolarizations are considered. Then, I turn to a sparse representation of spatial inhomogeneities (e.g. infarcts)\ntypical for arrhythmogenic regions in the heart. Finally, I address quantitatively fundamental questions such as: which local or collective mechanism is\ndriving a given recorded arrhythmia? What is the maximal prediction time in a simulation? How far is a measured sample away from an arrhythmic\nevent? \nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n02-05-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Python scripts and source code are stored at the GitLab repository: gitlab.kuleuven.be . This includes both the ithildin source files and the pre- and post-processing scripts, as well as any notes taken while conducting computational experiments during the project. The output of simulations is stored in ManGO. The experimental recordings and images are stored at and shared from internal servers of UZ Leuven. If relevant, a copy can be stored in ManGO as well. Project documents, postprocessing images and videofiles are stored in the SharePoint folder of the HeartKOR group and a personal OneDrive provided by KU Leuven. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? All the repositories above are equipped with a back-up system. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. No The only concern is the possible 10 TB of simulation data in ManGO. My research team is in contact with the support team, who is currently implementing the upload of large files (of 5-10 GB each). When that is successful, we will discuss which storage capacity can be acquired for this project. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The servers (GitLab, ManGO, SharePoint) are protected via an authentication procedure.

What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The servers I use are all provided and financially covered within my research team. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). institutional policies...). Long term storage of data provided by groups from Leuven, Leiden, Bordeaux and Minneapolis is already secured by them. At the end of the project, we will select which datasets created by the researcher during the project should be kept for a longer period. It is estimated that about 50% needs to be kept. This will be stored via a central backup in my research group. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? After the project, the ‘cold’ data that is not published (yet) will be transferred from ManGO to appropriate servers, via cold storage at KU Leuven data centers. Parts of the results will be shared together with the publications (e.g., via Zenodo or journal supplements). In case of a standalone data set or software, it will be published via KU Leuven RDR. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Publishing data sets in KU Leuven RDR is free, yet has a limit of 50GB per year along with a max. file size of 5GB. If data is published along with a publication, the costs are covered within the publication costs. Publishing data or code via Zenodo is free of cost and comes with a maximum size per record of 50GB. 5. Data sharing and reuse 5.

Yes, in an Open Access repository Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) The data that is involved in a publication will be shared according to Open Access principles. Data that was generated, but not used for publication, will be stored on internal servers, such as ManGO. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. The data will be available for the respective research groups of my (co-)promotors.
