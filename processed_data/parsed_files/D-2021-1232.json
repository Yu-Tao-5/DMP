Recently we have reviewed the literature on an intriguing\nfinding, notably ADPKDâ€™s association with lower blood cell counts. The strongest association\nin literature so far has been observed with alterations in the lymphocytic lineages, but also other\nwhite blood cell subtypes and thrombocytes are affected. The clinical significance of the\ndiseaseâ€™s association with lower blood cell counts is largely unknown. Previous data already\nshowed that the affected genes in ADPKD are also expressed in lymphocytes and interfere with\nlymphocyte proliferation and functioning. This research project seeks (1) to further explore the\nclinical association between cytopenia and ADPKD in well-defined clinical cohorts and to study its\nlink with clinical outcomes, (2) to study the expression and functional impact of molecular PKD-\ndefects in peripheral blood derived lymphocytes and neutrophils from ADPKD and non-ADPKD\ncontrol patients and (3) to study Ca2+ signaling, considered to be central in ADPKD\npathogenesis, in myeloid and lymphoid cell lines with and without functional polycystin-1 and-2.\nThe results of this combined clinical and fundamental research project are expected to shed a\nnew light on the functional role of polycystins in blood cells and the important inflammatory\ncomponent in the pathogenesis of ADPKD.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
