As access to the ISS is limited, ground -based \nfacilities are available on Earth to simulate different space stressors. Investigating the harmful \neffects of space on the human body is crucial to perform health risk assessments of astronauts \nduring deep -space missions. Organ -on-chips (OoC) are complex 3D cell culture models derived \nfrom human cells and can be used to mimic adverse health effects occurring in the astronaut's \nbody in space. OoCs require extensive resour ces and are time costly. To date, no off the shelf or \nlong-term storage solutions are available for these OoCs. This PhD aims to develop a long -term \nstorage method which extrapolation is not only relevant for deep -space manned missions, but \nalso in organ p reservation for transplantation purposes. During this project both cryopreservation \n(WP1) and hibernation -like state methodologies (WP2) will be developed for OoCs. Additionally, \nthe effects of simulated space stressors on OoCs (WP3) and the protective mec hanism from \ndeveloped preservation methodologies on the effect of simulated space stressors (WP4) will be \nstudied. This PhD proposal envisions to bring a solution to this medical need and would therefore \nbenefits not only the space industry in Flanders but  would also contribute to place Flanders \nbiotech/pharma as leader in long -term storage of transplantation organs.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   4 \n 2.

Here, folders will be made for \nall subtasks of the project. In each folder, a new protocol  will be made for each experiment, named \nwith  the date and subject, as well as version tracking. For each experiment,  all raw and analysed data \nfiles will be stored in a folder on the shared server . \n2) A physical sample inventory will be stored in freezers  and a file with sample details will be  saved \non the shared server.  \n \nAt SCK CEN:  \n1) Protocols (containing info about both materials  (setting, parameters, set -up, ...)  and methods),  \nthe research progress and obtained data, what they represent and how they were generated, will  \nbe collected  in the data management software (Alexandria) and complemented with a physical \nnotebook . In Alexandria, each item receive s its own identifier which is used throughout the progress \nreporting .

If not, please specify which \nmetadata will be created to make the data \neasier to find and reuse.  \n \nREPOSITORIES COULD AS K TO DELIVER METADAT A IN A CERTAIN \nFORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTO LOGIES AND VOCABULAR IES, I.E. \nSTANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . \n ☐ Yes \n☒ No \nIf yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata  standard  will be used :  \n \n \nIf no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created:  \n \nAt KU  Leuven:  \nNo uniform metadata standard is available for all different aspects and disciplines of this project. Therefore, \nwe will create a uniform system ourselves to enhance the use of secondary data. As mentioned ab ove, we \nwill use the shared drive ( K:) of KU Leuven to store protocols (containing info about both materials (setting, \nparameters, set -up, ...) and methods), the research progress and obtained data, what they represent and \nhow they were generated. The fold ers on the server facilitates searching for particular metadata through a \nsearch  engine , as well as linking of the metadata to the actual data will be facilitated.  \n \nAt SCK CEN:  \nThe data management software Alexandria utilize three aspects  when generating t he metadata of each \nunique identifier:  \n \n Classification: the classification divides documents into particular groups, based on the same \ncharacteristics. A classification may be created when documents have certain templates, \nworkflows, policies or attributes  which are necessary to identify them into the system.  \n Categories: a category is a group of attributes. The attributes are grouped by a specific topic, e.g. \nall attributes related to events are grouped into the category Event Attributes.  \n Attributes: attributes are additional information fields, which gives the document a certain \ncontext: e.g. the author of the document.  \n \n \n \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   11 \n 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project  \n \nWhere will the data be stored?  All biological material at both institutions  are under the Biobank of KU Leuven.  \nLabcollector  is used for data storage at KU Leuven (KUL). Alexandria is used for data storage at SCK CEN  \n \nHow will the data be backed up?  \n \nWHAT STORAGE AND BACK UP PROCEDURES WILL B E IN PLACE TO \nPREVENT DATA LOSS ? DESCRIBE THE LOCATION S, STORAGE MEDIA AND \nPROCEDURES THAT WILL  BE USED FOR STORING  AND BACKING UP \nDIGITAL AND NON -DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH .7 \n \nREFER TO INSTITUTION -SPECIFIC POLICIES RE GARDING BACKUP \nPROCEDURES  WHEN APPROPRIATE . \n At KU  Leuven:  \nLabcollect or is a database hosted on a password  protected KUL server, automatically backed up by KUL \nservices. A ll data are  traceable and stored beyond the 5 -year requirement.  \n \nAt SCK CEN:  \nAll data  is hosted on the SCK CEN protected servers (3 Tiers, RAID 6 level with double  parity disks).  Only SCK \nCEN personnel with SCK CEN computer can have access to the server (access right are limited depending on \nthe hierarchical position) . All data are traceable and stored beyond the 5 -year requirement .  \n \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities  are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.  ☒ Yes \n☐ No \nIf yes, please specify concisely:  \nKU Leuven  and SCK CEN ICT  provide  sufficient storage and back -up capacity during and after the  project. A  \ndedicated fold er will be made for the project.  \n \nIf no, please specify :  \n \n                                                      \n7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric:  https://osf.io/2z5g3/  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   12 \n How will you ensure that the data are securely \nstored and not accessed or modified by  \nunauthorized persons?  \n \nCLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL  SECURITY , \nNETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COM PUTER SYSTEMS AND \nFILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORE D AND \nTRANSFERRED DATA ARE  SAFE. 7 \n At KU  Leuven:  \nThe network drive for the FWO -SB project folder and the large volume storage folder are secured  by the \nICTS service of KU Leuven with a mirror copy. Only other lab members, will have access to  the shared folder.  \nUnauthorized persons do not have access to this system.  \n \nAt SCK CEN:  \nData storage are secured  by the ICTS service of  SCK CEN.  Access rights are managed by the data management \nsoftware Alexandria prior the req uirements. The project folder can be found in the Unit repertory (accessible \nby the lab members). The content of the project folder is however limited to the personnel working on the \nproject and the head of the Unit.  \n \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data  storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?  At KU  Leuven:  \nKU Leuven provides multiple options for (long term) data storage. Type 1 server backend storage  with mirror \nbackup for the FWO -SB project folder will cost € 270  per TB per year. The estimated  maximal cost for the 4 -\nyear project would therefore be € 1080. Large datasets that do not  require frequent access can be stored \non a separate server for large volume storage, costing €  113,84 per TB per year. The estimated m aximal cost \nfor the 4 -year project would therefore be €  455,36 if this type of data storage is required. All costs will be \ncovered by the project budget.  \n \nAt SCK CEN:  \nData storage and backup costs are managed at the Unit level  (not at  the project level) . Each stored TB cost \n€ 35 per month  + € 200 maintenance costs /year . The estimated  maximal cost for the 4 -year project would \ntherefore be € 5000 (assuming the generation of 1TB data/year) and is covered by the Unit internal funds.  \n \n \n \n \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   13 \n 5. Data Preservation  after the end of the Research P roject  \n \nWhich data will be retained for at least five \nyears (or longer, in agreement with other \nretention policies that are applicable) after the \nend of the  project? In case some data cannot be \npreserved , clearly state the reasons for this  \n(e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). All data obtained during this FWO project will be retained for the expected 5 year period.  \nWhere will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long -term)?   \n1) The digital data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic backup  \nprocedures) for at least 5 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.  SCK CEN operates similarly with the \nobtained data on their servers.  \n2) The physical data will be stored in freezers in the labs of the collaborators for up to 5 years  \nafter the project.  \n3) The accompanying metadata  will be stored on the shared drive (K:)  (KU Leuven) and on Alexandria (SCK \nCEN).  \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during the expected retention \nperiod? How will these costs be covered?  \n \n \n At KU Leuven:  \nCost of the large volume storage will be € 128,39 per TB and year. We anticipate that we will  need 1 TB for \n5 years to keep the essential data available. This will amount to € 614,95 and will  be covered by the project's \nbudget.  \n \nAt SCK CEN:  \nAssuming a total of 4 TB , the total cost will be € 1680 per year. The costs are covered by the Unit internal \nfunds.  \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   14 \n 6.

As access to the ISS is limited, ground -based facilities are available on Earth to simulate different space stressors. Investigating the harmful effects of space on the human body is crucial to perform health risk assessments of astronauts during deep -space missions. Organ -on-chips (OoC) are complex 3D cell culture models derived from human cells and can be used to mimic adverse health effects occurring in the astronaut's body in space. OoCs require extensive resour ces and are time costly. To date, no off the shelf or long-term storage solutions are available for these OoCs. This PhD aims to develop a long -term storage method which extrapolation is not only relevant for deep -space manned missions, but also in organ p reservation for transplantation purposes. During this project both cryopreservation (WP1) and hibernation -like state methodologies (WP2) will be developed for OoCs. Additionally, the effects of simulated space stressors on OoCs (WP3) and the protective mec hanism from developed preservation methodologies on the effect of simulated space stressors (WP4) will be studied. This PhD proposal envisions to bring a solution to this medical need and would therefore benefits not only the space industry in Flanders but would also contribute to place Flanders biotech/pharma as leader in long -term storage of transplantation organs.

If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please explain: Research collaboration agreement between KU Leuven and SCK CEN . Developed methodologies and their dependent results will be shared. Reporter vectors (ownership of KU Leuven) will be transfer to SCK CEN for experimental purposes on the heart -on-chip within this project. Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please explain: In this project two organ -on-chips will be used. Ownership of the lung -on-chip belongs to KU Leuven while the ownership of the heart -on-chip belongs to SCK CEN. The preservation methods will be co-shared between KU Leuven and SCK CEN (50/50). 6 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan X FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9 3. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures u sed, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). At KU Leuven: 1) Protocols (containing info about both materials (setting, parameters, set -up, ...) and methods), the research progress and obtained da ta, what they represent and how they were generated, will be collected and stored on the shared drive (K: drive) of KU Leuven . Here, folders will be made for all subtasks of the project. In each folder, a new protocol will be made for each experiment, named with the date and subject, as well as version tracking. For each experiment, all raw and analysed data files will be stored in a folder on the shared server . 2) A physical sample inventory will be stored in freezers and a file with sample details will be saved on the shared server. At SCK CEN: 1) Protocols (containing info about both materials (setting, parameters, set -up, ...) and methods), the research progress and obtained data, what they represent and how they were generated, will be collected in the data management software (Alexandria) and complemented with a physical notebook . In Alexandria, each item receive s its own identifier which is used throughout the progress reporting . The hierarchical folder structur e will follow the one from KU Leuven. 2) A physical sample inventory will be stored in freezers and fridges. A file with sample details will be saved on Alexandria . FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD AS K TO DELIVER METADAT A IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTO LOGIES AND VOCABULAR IES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: At KU Leuven: No uniform metadata standard is available for all different aspects and disciplines of this project. Therefore, we will create a uniform system ourselves to enhance the use of secondary data. As mentioned ab ove, we will use the shared drive ( K:) of KU Leuven to store protocols (containing info about both materials (setting, parameters, set -up, ...) and methods), the research progress and obtained data, what they represent and how they were generated. The fold ers on the server facilitates searching for particular metadata through a search engine , as well as linking of the metadata to the actual data will be facilitated. At SCK CEN: The data management software Alexandria utilize three aspects when generating t he metadata of each unique identifier:  Classification: the classification divides documents into particular groups, based on the same characteristics. A classification may be created when documents have certain templates, workflows, policies or attributes which are necessary to identify them into the system.  Categories: a category is a group of attributes. The attributes are grouped by a specific topic, e.g. all attributes related to events are grouped into the category Event Attributes.  Attributes: attributes are additional information fields, which gives the document a certain context: e.g. the author of the document. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? All biological material at both institutions are under the Biobank of KU Leuven. Labcollector is used for data storage at KU Leuven (KUL). Alexandria is used for data storage at SCK CEN How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACK UP PROCEDURES WILL B E IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? DESCRIBE THE LOCATION S, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON -DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH .7 REFER TO INSTITUTION -SPECIFIC POLICIES RE GARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE . At KU Leuven: Labcollect or is a database hosted on a password protected KUL server, automatically backed up by KUL services. A ll data are traceable and stored beyond the 5 -year requirement. At SCK CEN: All data is hosted on the SCK CEN protected servers (3 Tiers, RAID 6 level with double parity disks). Only SCK CEN personnel with SCK CEN computer can have access to the server (access right are limited depending on the hierarchical position) . All data are traceable and stored beyond the 5 -year requirement . Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: KU Leuven and SCK CEN ICT provide sufficient storage and back -up capacity during and after the project. A dedicated fold er will be made for the project. If no, please specify : 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12 How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COM PUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORE D AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7 At KU Leuven: The network drive for the FWO -SB project folder and the large volume storage folder are secured by the ICTS service of KU Leuven with a mirror copy. Only other lab members, will have access to the shared folder. Unauthorized persons do not have access to this system. At SCK CEN: Data storage are secured by the ICTS service of SCK CEN. Access rights are managed by the data management software Alexandria prior the req uirements. The project folder can be found in the Unit repertory (accessible by the lab members). The content of the project folder is however limited to the personnel working on the project and the head of the Unit. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? At KU Leuven: KU Leuven provides multiple options for (long term) data storage. Type 1 server backend storage with mirror backup for the FWO -SB project folder will cost € 270 per TB per year. The estimated maximal cost for the 4 - year project would therefore be € 1080. Large datasets that do not require frequent access can be stored on a separate server for large volume storage, costing € 113,84 per TB per year. The estimated m aximal cost for the 4 -year project would therefore be € 455,36 if this type of data storage is required. All costs will be covered by the project budget. At SCK CEN: Data storage and backup costs are managed at the Unit level (not at the project level) . Each stored TB cost € 35 per month + € 200 maintenance costs /year . The estimated maximal cost for the 4 -year project would therefore be € 5000 (assuming the generation of 1TB data/year) and is covered by the Unit internal funds. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). All data obtained during this FWO project will be retained for the expected 5 year period. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? 1) The digital data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic backup procedures) for at least 5 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. SCK CEN operates similarly with the obtained data on their servers. 2) The physical data will be stored in freezers in the labs of the collaborators for up to 5 years after the project. 3) The accompanying metadata will be stored on the shared drive (K:) (KU Leuven) and on Alexandria (SCK CEN). What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? At KU Leuven: Cost of the large volume storage will be € 128,39 per TB and year. We anticipate that we will need 1 TB for 5 years to keep the essential data available. This will amount to € 614,95 and will be covered by the project's budget. At SCK CEN: Assuming a total of 4 TB , the total cost will be € 1680 per year. The costs are covered by the Unit internal funds. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14 6.
