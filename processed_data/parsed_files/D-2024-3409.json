If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number).☐ Yes (provide PRET G-number or EC S-number below) ☒ No Additional information: Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin- offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please comment: 4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 7Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 83.Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .We will maintain a record of the following for every WP for 10 years (where applicable): - Experimental design and protocol (.docx file) - Abbreviations used (.docx file) - Data structure documentation (.docx file) - Steps involved in data analysis and relevant analysis scripts ( R, MATLAB, Python and ImageJ scripts) - Raw data (specific file format according to data type) - Analysed data (specific file format according to data type) - Index file/read me file (.txt file) for every WP, linking the name, location (folder and subfolder on /server) and description of above-mentioned files. Physical data: Samples taken from experiments will be documented and stored for up to three years after the end of the project. Storage will be in fixative, in paraffin, at 4C or in freezers depending on the kind of sample. Immunohistological stained slides will be stored in appropriate boxes in a dry place or fridge. We deviate from the 10 years rule because after three years, quality of the physical samples cannot be guaranteed anymore. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: The experiments are unique, but the data will be standardized according to data-type across experiments to make it easier to interpret the structure. Below, we list the metadata standards applicable to this project: Metadata standards will be used for genomics (http://enews.patricbrc.org/faqs/genome- metadata-faqs/). For all other data, metadata will be created using the Dublin core (http://dublincore.org/groups/tools/). If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 94.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data.☒ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☒ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☒ Other: ManGo (KU Leuven) How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? ☒ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back-ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No There is currently sufficient storage at KU Leuven ICTS. If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data Researchers involved in the project can control who they give access to the files on their personal OneDrive. To access the KU Leuven servers, access is provided and controlled by the group leader, Eve Seuntjens. The KU Leuven ICTS data center hosts the network storage, with a mirror available in the second ICTS center. This ensures additional back-up capacity, recovery of lost data and long term data availability. The access is controlled by KU Leuven security groups and it is password protected. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Back-up cost per Tb (KU Leuven ICTS): 295€/year Large Volume Storage: 95,14€/Tb/year Expected amount of data (5 Tb). The costs have been budgeted on the grant 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☒ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Digital data: We will retain all data for the expected 10 year period. We expect that we will make the data publicly available on data repositories upon publication of the manuscripts. Physical data: Samples taken from experiments will be documented and stored for up to three years after the end of the project. We deviate from the 10 years rule because after three years, quality of the physical samples cannot be guaranteed anymore. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): Digital data will be stored at the Archive (K:) server from KU Leuven ICTS. HCR probes and physical samples will be stored in the freezers from the Research Group of Developmental Neurobiology. Code scripts will be stored on Github. Notebooks will be kept in the lab for at least 10 years. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Back-up cost per Tb (KU Leuven ICTS): 295€/year Large Volume Storage: 95,14€/Tb/year Expected amount of data (5 Tb). After the project, data preservation costs will be covered by other grants. 6.
