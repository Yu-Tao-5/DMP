The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Charlotte Van Edom (0000-0003-2830-624X)\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Prof. dr.

Importantly, bleeding and thrombotic complications \nremain the Achilles’ heel of these patients. This precarious haemostatic balance results from the \ncombination of a pro-coagulant state, due to contact pathway activation by the plastic material from the \ndevice with our without critical illness, together with several factors aggravating the bleeding risk, such as \nthe need for anticoagulation and induced coagulation abnormalities. This project focusses on \nanticoagulation during MCS by assessing current practices and exploring new approaches in the field in \norder to reduce morbidity and mortality in this population. We will compare current anticoagulant \npractices within European MCS-centres via an international survey and study the correlation between \ncoagulant tests in this setting, as well as potential causes of discrepancies. Furthermore, we will \nretrospectively and prospectively study the usage of DOACs (apixaban) in the setting of MCS.\n2.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): University central server, OneDrive with automatic back-up procedures, conform KU Leuven RDM policy. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Centralized KU Leuven online storage solution will suffice for completion of this project via the KU Leuven OneDrive. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☐ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☒ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: Published data will remain available as part of the published work and as part of the required data for validation/auditing. More data can be made available upon request after permission of the principal investigator and after evaluation of the data request proposal. Only anonymised data can be made available. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Upon reasonable request, anonymous data can be made available for research collaborations, through a data sharing agreement. Requests will be evaluated by the principal investigator. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Other data repository (specify) ☒ Other (specify): Data availability will be chosen depending on publication strategy. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12When will the data be made available? ☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED.
