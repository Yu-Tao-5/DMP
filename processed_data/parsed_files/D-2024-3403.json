While covalent bond-based chiral modification of solid substrates offers high stability, it remains relatively underexplored, particularly\nfrom a nanoscale patterning standpoint. This underscores the necessity for developing systematic approaches for chiral covalent\nsurface modification and conducting comprehensive nanoscale characterization. Surfaces patterned with chiral features at sub-5-\nnanometer periodicities hold promising potential in chiral separations, sensing, and catalysis. Moreover, exploring the adsorption and\nself-assembly of organic molecules on such patterned surfaces will yield valuable insights into the mechanisms of chiral transmission\nfrom the surface to surface-bound entities, a critical aspect in understanding enantioselective adsorption. The project aims to devise\nsystematic methodologies for crafting patterned surfaces with precise control over the arrangement of chiral functional groups and to\nleverage these surfaces for conducting proof-of-concept experiments on enantioselective self-assembly.\nID: \nID: \n214086\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-11-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n31-10-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n31-03-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
