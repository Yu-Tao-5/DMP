Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNo\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nNo\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\n At this moment no such results are to be expected. However, if these would come up during the\nresearch work, KU Leuven Research and Development - Tech Transfer office will be consulted to\nprovide guidance.\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nPhysical data\nA hard copy lab notebook will be stored for at least 10 years after the ending of the project.\nDigital data\nResearch methods and practices used will be noted in Standard Operating Procedures (.doc) file,\nupdated whenever needed and placed in a dedicated shared folder.\nFor each analysis a separate Excel file (.xls) will be set-up consisting of at least:\n1) a reference to SOP used\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n6 of 8\n2) raw data as measured by the device, including metadata such as date, descripitive sample\nname, etc.\n3) processing of data\nFor all data generated in a program other than Excel, a dedicated folder will be used where\nthese raw data files are saved. If processing of these data is needed, a copy will be made to\nanother folder to avoid irreversible changes in the raw data.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nNo metadata standard will be used.\nHowever, each procedure will be performed according to a SOP, stored in the research team's\nonline sharepoint with an integrated version history. Each sample will have a reference to the\nSOP used. In addition, a meaningfull, unique description of the sample, analysis date and\nimportant additional remarks (unexpected changes to SOP) are included.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nAll data will be stored on a dedicated Sharepoint site, provided by the university of KU Leuven\nand accesible through a Teams channel managed by professor Ilse Fraeye. Parts of this channel\ncan be shared with other researchers or parties if necessary. The version history of this set-up\nmakes it possible to see at any time who made which changes at what time.\nBecause the project contains no sensitive or personal data, the data does not need to be\nanonymised.\n \nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe used sharepoint site foresees in back-ups for calamities.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThe dedicated Sharepoint site has a large storage capacity, more than enough for the estimated\n30 GB of data being generated during this research project.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nBecause the data storage on Sharepoint site is standard provided by the university, no additional\ncosts are to be covered. However, in case unexpected costs will emerge, these costs will be\ncovered by the project or lab budget whenever needed.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nThe dedicated Teams channel has a build-in security feature. Supported by the university, the\ndata will not be accessible by unauthorized persons. Furthermore, no sensitive data will be\nstored, so even a (unlikely) breach of this security will have a minor impact.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll data will be preserved for at least 10 years after the end of the project.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nThe data will be stored on the university's large archive servers (with automatic back-up\nprocedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.\nThe physical notebooks will be kept in a dedicated locker of the applicant's research group for a\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n7 of 8\nminimum of 10 years.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nThe annual cost of the archive server amounts to 12 euro per 100 GB. Therefore the cost related\nto storage of the data related to this project (~ 30 GB) is estimated to be 4 euros per year. This\ncost will be covered by the applicant's research lab.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nNo\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nAll published data will be made available the latest at the end of the project.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn an Open Access repository\nIn a restricted access repository\nUpon request by mail\nOther (specify):\nStandard the data will be available to Ilse Fraeye and thus to the researchers of the applicant's\nresearch group through the Sharepoint site.\nHowever, external parties could ask for this data by sending a mail request to Ilse Fraeye, after\nwhich they could receive a copy.\nAll data used in publications will be shared in open acces format through Lirias.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nResearchers of the applicant's research group are able to access the data at any time by\naccessing the dedicated Teams channel. Further more, all data related to published articles will\nbe shared through their publication.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nThe costs are expected to be non-existent. If there would be a publication in Open Acces Journal,\nthe project funding will be used to cover the costs.\n8. Responsibilities\nWho will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?\nQuinten Masijn\nWho will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nQuinten Masijn\nIlse Fraeye\nWho will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ?\nIlse Fraeye\nWho bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nIlse Fraeye\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n8 of 8"

Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place? No 4. Documentation and metadata What documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this project? Physical data A hard copy lab notebook will be stored for at least 10 years after the ending of the project. Digital data Research methods and practices used will be noted in Standard Operating Procedures (.doc) file, updated whenever needed and placed in a dedicated shared folder. For each analysis a separate Excel file (.xls) will be set-up consisting of at least: 1) a reference to SOP used This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 6 of 8 2) raw data as measured by the device, including metadata such as date, descripitive sample name, etc. 3) processing of data For all data generated in a program other than Excel, a dedicated folder will be used where these raw data files are saved. If processing of these data is needed, a copy will be made to another folder to avoid irreversible changes in the raw data. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used. If no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse. No No metadata standard will be used. However, each procedure will be performed according to a SOP, stored in the research team's online sharepoint with an integrated version history. Each sample will have a reference to the SOP used. In addition, a meaningfull, unique description of the sample, analysis date and important additional remarks (unexpected changes to SOP) are included. 5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project Where will the data be stored? All data will be stored on a dedicated Sharepoint site, provided by the university of KU Leuven and accesible through a Teams channel managed by professor Ilse Fraeye. Parts of this channel can be shared with other researchers or parties if necessary. The version history of this set-up makes it possible to see at any time who made which changes at what time. Because the project contains no sensitive or personal data, the data does not need to be anonymised. How is backup of the data provided? The used sharepoint site foresees in back-ups for calamities. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes The dedicated Sharepoint site has a large storage capacity, more than enough for the estimated 30 GB of data being generated during this research project. What are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these costs be covered? Because the data storage on Sharepoint site is standard provided by the university, no additional costs are to be covered. However, in case unexpected costs will emerge, these costs will be covered by the project or lab budget whenever needed. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The dedicated Teams channel has a build-in security feature. Supported by the university, the data will not be accessible by unauthorized persons. Furthermore, no sensitive data will be stored, so even a (unlikely) breach of this security will have a minor impact. 6. Data preservation after the FWO project Which data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...). All data will be preserved for at least 10 years after the end of the project. Where will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)? The data will be stored on the university's large archive servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. The physical notebooks will be kept in a dedicated locker of the applicant's research group for a This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 7 of 8 minimum of 10 years. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered? The annual cost of the archive server amounts to 12 euro per 100 GB. Therefore the cost related to storage of the data related to this project (~ 30 GB) is estimated to be 4 euros per year. This cost will be covered by the applicant's research lab. 7. Data sharing and reuse Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? No Which data will be made available after the end of the project? All published data will be made available the latest at the end of the project. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? In an Open Access repository In a restricted access repository Upon request by mail Other (specify): Standard the data will be available to Ilse Fraeye and thus to the researchers of the applicant's research group through the Sharepoint site. However, external parties could ask for this data by sending a mail request to Ilse Fraeye, after which they could receive a copy. All data used in publications will be shared in open acces format through Lirias. When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? Researchers of the applicant's research group are able to access the data at any time by accessing the dedicated Teams channel. Further more, all data related to published articles will be shared through their publication. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered? The costs are expected to be non-existent. If there would be a publication in Open Acces Journal, the project funding will be used to cover the costs. 8. Responsibilities Who will be responsible for data documentation & metadata? Quinten Masijn Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project? Quinten Masijn Ilse Fraeye Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ? Ilse Fraeye Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP? Ilse Fraeye This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 8 of 8"
