As a result, in the coming decade a large number of bridges, tunnels, and other important\nstructures will enter a critical age of 50 years, typically linked to significant levels of corrosion and\ndeterioration. Therefore, it becomes increasingly important to be able to accurately assess the safety\nand remaining lifetime of existing structures, taking account of the current state of corrosion and\npredicting its evolution over time. The corrosion of reinforced concrete structures occurs mainly due\nto the penetration of water, oxygen, carbonation and chlorides in the concrete, which leads to\ndepassivation and corrosion of the steel reinforcement. These processes are accelerated by cracks in\nthe structure. As the corrosion advances, the cracks open wider and as the cracks open wider, the\ncorrosion advances even faster, thus quickly reducing the safety of the structure. This project aims at\ninvestigating the coupling between the corrosion and the mechanical behavior in critical regions of\nreinforced concrete structures. The problem will be tackled by testing at small scale, designing and\nimplementing an innovative setup for coupled testing at large scale, and extending the capacities of\na crack- and kinematics-based mechanical modeling framework to incorporate interaction with\nenhanced corrosion models and predict the mechanical degradation with inclusion of corrosion\neffects.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n07-05-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
