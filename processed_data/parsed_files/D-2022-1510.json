This ever changing\nastrochemistry is a critical ingredient for the understanding of the formation and evolution of\ngalaxies in the Universe. So far, chemical yield computations rely on stellar structure and\nevolution models that remained uncalibrated in terms of interior chemical mixing and interior\nrotation properties. Here, we take an entirely unique approach by computing chemical yields\nfrom new stellar models to be computed in accordance with asteroseismology of stars. We treat\nthe carefully chosen range of intermediate- and high-mass stars between 3 and 25 solar masses.\nAsteroseismology - the study and interpretation of detected stellar oscillations - will be applied to\nboth single and binary stars in this mass range. Stellar oscillations are massively detected\nnowadays across the entire sky thanks to new high-precision space photometric time series\nassembled by the NASA TESS space telescope. Coupling these NASA data to ESA Gaia space\nastrometry and ground-based spectroscopy assembled at worldwide observatories offers a new\nand unique way to calibrate the interior chemistry and rotation of stars in our Milky Way and in\nour closest metal-poor neighbouring galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud. Our FWO project brings\nthe first chemical yield computations based on new stellar models calibrated by asteroseismically\ninferred chemical mixing profiles of stars of intermediate and high mass.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
