When developing micro-architectural components, for instance, the physical effects are abstracted away. This abstraction is also reflected in the\nsecurity evaluation of these processors; micro-architectural security and physical side-channel security are typically considered separately. However,\nthe combined security should also be considered due to the close interaction of these micro-architectural components and the underlying physical\nimplementation. This holistic approach may allow for new insights and may unveil new vulnerabilities.\nThis project aims to bridge the gap between research into micro-architectural security and physical side-channel security.

In a later phase, and after the publication of the research\npaper concerned, the relevant data will be made available in the RDR repository. KU Leuven RDR is hosted on KU Leuven servers maintained\nby the KU Leuven IT team and located in the KU Leuven data centers. In parallel, we will store the same data in our departemental home\ndirectories, hosted by a server at our research department.\nLarger data, such as side-channel traces, will be stored on COSIC's server dedicated to storing side-channel traces. \nHow will the data be backed up?\nHow will the data be backed up?\nWe replicate the data sets among at least two department computers. The GitLab repositories are hosted by a server at our research department\nand get a daily backup. GitHub is a well-established, commercial repository service provider, which we assume has industry-standard data\navailability measures in place (such that repositories will not be lost unless deleted by authorized GitHub users). RDR backups are handled by\nKU Leuven.\nThe larger data stored on COSIC's file server is not backed up. These are easy-to-reproduce data of a size (10GB—1TB) that is impractical to\nbackup. In the case of this big data, we will keep 1 million traces of data as a sample together with a detailed description of the measurement.\nThe description will be stored on GitLab or RDR.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project?

Yes All experimental data (traces, ...) will be made available in KU Leuven RDR, thus we will use the DataCite standard. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 18 April 2024 4 of 7 Data used to produce project results will be stored in a GitHub/GitLab repository. In a later phase, and after the publication of the research paper concerned, the relevant data will be made available in the RDR repository. KU Leuven RDR is hosted on KU Leuven servers maintained by the KU Leuven IT team and located in the KU Leuven data centers. In parallel, we will store the same data in our departemental home directories, hosted by a server at our research department. Larger data, such as side-channel traces, will be stored on COSIC's server dedicated to storing side-channel traces. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? We replicate the data sets among at least two department computers. The GitLab repositories are hosted by a server at our research department and get a daily backup. GitHub is a well-established, commercial repository service provider, which we assume has industry-standard data availability measures in place (such that repositories will not be lost unless deleted by authorized GitHub users). RDR backups are handled by KU Leuven. The larger data stored on COSIC's file server is not backed up. These are easy-to-reproduce data of a size (10GB—1TB) that is impractical to backup. In the case of this big data, we will keep 1 million traces of data as a sample together with a detailed description of the measurement. The description will be stored on GitLab or RDR. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes There is sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project. We have many Terabytes of storage space available on the department machines we use to replicate our data sets. The department's Gitlab instance and GitHub are offered services and are thus ensured to have enough spare capacity. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Access to our department machines is managed by access to the university network and standard-practice user permissions on the machine (only users with the right set of permissions can access the data, our department controls the management of these users). The GitLab repository has access control and is maintained by a DMP officer who keeps the structure of the repository in place and manages the access control. Unauthorized GitHub modifications are prevented through their industry-standard user management. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The costs of the gitlab maintenance are covered by our research group. These costs are integrated into the general IT costs. The use of GitHub is free of charge. The costs of RDR are covered by KU Leuven. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project 4.

In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). institutional policies...). Datasets are stored on GitHub/GitLab and RDR repositories and will be retained for at least 10 years after the end of the project. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? To the extent feasible in terms of the volume of collected data, the data will be stored in the Gitlab, GitHub, and RDR repositories. If we consider it necessary to purchase archival storage capacity for the entirety of the research project's artifacts (e.g., due to non-reproducibility of some data sets and limitations on the Gitlab and GitHub services), we will do so appropriately and in time before the project concludes.
