This file is the only document that links the patients study code and identification of the\npatient. \n \n4.2. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be\nused. If not, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\n We plan to use a metadata standard, basing ourselves on different available sources, such as\nhttp://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards\n; \nhttp://rd-alliance.github.io/metadata-\ndirectory/standards/\n; \nhttps://fairsharing.org/\n5.

Which data will be made available after the end of the project?\nThe published data will be available which contains the results of processed coded data\npresented in tables. The full anonymized dataset consisting of only data of participants who\ngranted their approval for re-use within the research group will be available at the end of the\nproject. Decoded personal data will never be shared.\n7.3.
