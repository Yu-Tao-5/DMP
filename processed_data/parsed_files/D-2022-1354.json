For this purpose, some technical steps have to be taken: the\nmodular assembly of cylindrical transducers for excitation with phased array receivers on a\ncircular arc with special attention to the reduction of crosstalk, development of a rotation\nmechanism to rotate the arc around its zenith, optimization of the water/gel coupling between\nthe transmitter-receivers and the object to be inspected, performance testing of the system on\nmetals and composites, and global optimization of the system. The research questions to be\naddressed are thus connected to the technical issues in the development and optimisation of the\nprototype. The data to be collected and created are hardware and software design specifications,\nas well as scripts to control, record and analyse experimental reflection and transmission signals\nat ultrasonic frequencies,\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Documentation and Metadata\nDescribe the documentation that will be created for the data. This section deals with\nthe way in which you will document how the dataset was created and subsequently\nprocessed.\n1) Hardware and software design specifications will be described in detail in a lab book.\n2) Raw data will be collected per test, including a txt file with a clear description of what the data\nrepresent and how they were generated. The name of the folder will contain the sample ID under\nconsideration and a reference to the conditions of the experiment (A .txt file explaining the\nnaming will be maintained).\n3) Processed data and images will be kept in the same folder as the raw data. A ReadMe file of\nthe image collection will be written. \nDescribe the metadata for the data. This section deals with metadata: information\ncontained in your dataset about the research data.\nTo our knowledge, there is no standard available yet for the kind of data that we will\ngenerate. All files will be named with a structured file name (initials, date, description of exp).\nThe file names together with the dates of creation allow quick reference to the lab-notebook,\nwhere the assembly actions and/or specific experiment(s) are described with more detailed\nparameters (time, consignee, protocol, hardware settings, control software, samples names,\nconditions, ...). For extremely large amounts of data and easier recollection of data, the use of sql\ndatabase will be explored in order to make the data better accessible to other persons.\n3.
