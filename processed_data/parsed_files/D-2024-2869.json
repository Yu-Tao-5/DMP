Developmental\nplasticity, which enables organisms to adjust their phenotype in response to environmental cues within a single generation, is particularly important in\nthis process. Although the adaptive significance of such a response is generally recognized, the underlying molecular mechanisms and how they evolve\nremain highly elusive. Fortunately, novel genome methods enable the study of the mechanisms that orchestrate the development of plastic phenotypes.\nMy aim is to integrate these novel methods into evolutionary studies that test the importance of plasticity in the process of long-term adaptation to\nchanging environments and the resulting genetic adaptation. Specifically, I will test a mechanism by which genetic diversity is masked in populations\nthat plastically express alternative phenotypes and how this plasticity may precede genetic adaptation - a contentious but undemonstrated theory called\n‘plasticity-led evolution’. I will perform these experiments on the water flea Daphnia, an established model system for plastic development.\nUnderstanding genes involved in plasticity and how they interact with the process of genetic adaptation has the potential to offer insights into the very\nessence of life and to provide various applications in biotechnology, medicine, and mitigation of species loss under extreme environmental change.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n20-10-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Costs for data storage are included in the funded project and allow purchasing external harddrives and KU Leuven VSC Tier-1 Data Storage until the end of the project. 4.

If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Processed sequence data will be stored in at least two location using external harddrives and KU Leuven VSC Tier-1 Data Storage. These data can be reproduced from raw reads and the available processing pipelines (shared on GitHub). These processed data types are not typicalle uploaded to NVBI for storage and sharing, but after publication, these data will also be freely available upon request and shared through web transfers.
