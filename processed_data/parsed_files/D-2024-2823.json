The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Dries Pattyn (0000-0002-6989-0668)\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles\nProject number 1 & title 1SHH424N\nDesign for Dialogue: Interpolating civic engagement, ecology and urban design in Brussels\nFunder(s) GrantID 2FWO 1SHH424N\nAffiliation(s) ☒ KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nROR identifier KU Leuven: 05f950310\nPlease provide a short project description Conflicting ecological and urban development goals in cities world-wide often lead to urban disputes among citizen \ngroups, governmental institutions, and designers. In Brussels, like in many other cities, the debate about future \ndevelopment seems to be characterized by a double antagonism: one between formal institutions and action \ncommittees; and one between ecological and social challenges (such as the need for a natural environment versus \nmore housing). This doctoral project seeks to investigate if, and how urban, landscape and architectural design can \novercome this duality and lead to a productive synthesis instead. It stems from the assumption that design, \nintended both as a process and a product, is capable of reconciling competing claims; that it is able to provide a \nplatform for discussion and consensus-building between competing and traditionally distant stakeholders; and that \nis able to contribute, through its exemplar character, to the professional and disciplinary debate. To this end, this \nproject aims at investigating past examples of citizen actions asking to what extend their tools and strategies \nprovide useful insights for a recalibration of citizen participation today, and the role of design and of the designer \ntherein.\n2.Research Data Summary\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

The FWO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.

It stems from the assumption that design, intended both as a process and a product, is capable of reconciling competing claims; that it is able to provide a platform for discussion and consensus-building between competing and traditionally distant stakeholders; and that is able to contribute, through its exemplar character, to the professional and disciplinary debate. To this end, this project aims at investigating past examples of citizen actions asking to what extend their tools and strategies provide useful insights for a recalibration of citizen participation today, and the role of design and of the designer therein. 2.Research Data Summary 1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all materials that need proper management because they are valuable, difficult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentation/metadata. RDM Guidance on data If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type.

If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number).☒ Yes (provide PRET G-number or EC S-number below) ☐ No Additional information: Interviews When conducting interviews personal data such as name, age, gender, profession, home municipality, email address, phone number will be collected. Interviews will be recorded and transcribed. Names of interviewees will be pseudonymised unless it is relevant/necessary to use the name of the interviewee (e.g. an architect or a politician) and the interviewee consents to using their personal data. The file where the pseudonyms are linked to the personal data and identifiers will be stored separately on the KU Leuven server. Interviewees will include: (former) politicians, members of citizens' associations, architects activists from neighbourhood committees, students/members of architectural institutions such as La Cambre and Sint- Lucas, officials from public institutions such as Brussels Environment and Perspective Brussels Design labs and roundtable discussions - Interactive moments with stakeholders will be organised in the formats of (1) design and research labs and (2) roundtable discussions (1) In these half-yearly labs the research and design is discussed with members of the most important action committees (BRAL, ARAU and IEB) (2) Starting an in-depth conversation between the action committees and the Brussels governmental actors (Brussels Environment, Perspective Brussels, BMA) to identify the frictions and possible synergies, based on historical examples and design proposals. For these interactive moments participants' personal data (name, e-mail address, telephone number) will be collected for practical use. In the output of these interactive moments, participants will be anonymised and only the name of the organisation will be stated, except in the case of the BMA (Brussels' city architect). In entering the discussions on safeguarding open space in Brussels, sensitive and clashing viewpoints and opinions will come forward in the debates. In reporting on such events, awareness and precaution is necessary in order to avoid severe conflict between citizens and other stakeholder.
