No KU Leuven currently has a strong IP position regarding the 2-aminoimidazoles with granted patents with product claims, application claims and a long service life. We expect the new TRA-coating to be patentable due to the new use of boronic acid esters for the triggered release of antimicrobials. 2. Documentation and Metadata 2.

The key characteristics will also be denoted in the filename of the data files. 2. A detailed experimental protocol will be added to the directory of the corresponding experimental results. This step-wise description will facilitate potential future reproduction of the experiments. 3. For every deliverable in the project, a general outline txt file will be created.

Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? 1. Data generated by the different partners will be saved on a collective sharepoint for the data during the project. In view of the size of the raw microscopy and sequencing data, these data will be exempt from the sharepoint. 2. Additionally each partner will store their generated data on the central storage facility of their respective research units with the same structure as the sharepoints. 3. Personal copies can be made and kept on personal devices. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? 1. The collective sharepoint is backed up three times per day. 2. The internal back-up of the specific partners is managed according the procedures of their respective research institutions. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.

Yes Sufficient storage space is provided by the respective research institutions How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? 1. Viewing and modification rights in sharepoint are granted based on the involvement in the specific work packages. 2. Critical documents, e.g. reports, presentations,... can be (temporarily) locked by the author(s). 3. Sharepoint provides a changelog for detecting and reverting possible unauthorized changes. 4. The internal storage of the partners provides a back-up for the sharepoint and vice versa. 5. Physical data is stored in a secured -80°C freezer at the facility with limited-access. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? 1. The total cost of storage are estimated on ~€3000-€400 per year, mainly for the raw sequencing data (~5TB) and microscopic pictures (~5TB). 2.The costs will be covered by the respective partners using the allocated project budget 4.

What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The shared network at KU Leuven (used for temporary storage) covers 100GB per research unit. Additional storage on this drive costs approximately 580 euros per TB per year. Long-term storage on the archive network (K: drives) cost approximately 130 euros per TB per year. The costs will be covered by the project. 5. Data sharing and reuse 5.

In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. dataset or data type which data will be made available. Other, please specify: No data produced and/or used in TRACOAT will be made openly available by default. The TRACOAT project is focused on industrial competitiveness. Much of the data, as well as the existing data used for the project, will be of commercial interest for the partners, and it is necessary to exclude it from open access. However, we still aim to be \"as open as possible\". Therefore, the consortium expects to eventually publish the most important project results through peer-reviewed publications, with open access to the related experimental data, when all required protection of IPR has been obtained. We will consider the IPR and open access requirements together in the context of the exploitation strategy for each result. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.
