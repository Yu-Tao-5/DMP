If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: There is enough space to store the data on OneDrive (KU Leuven) and the servers at the NBB to make back-up on my personal OneDrive. If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7For research project 1: the data will be stored on the servers of the national bank of Belgium and can only be accessed using a computer at the NBB.

Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).The KU Leuven requires its researchers to store their data for at least 10 years. Typically, the supervisor of a PhD student is responsible for data preservation. Therefore, Jozef Konings (supervisor) & the National Bank of Belgium will be designated as the responsible person. Furthermore, the data files will not be too large in terms of memory and can be stored on the faculty's servers during and after my research. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?Project 1: ☒ Standard back-up provided by the National Bank of Belgium Project 2: ☒ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☒ Personal back-ups I make ☒ Data also will be backed up on my personal OneDrive storage, password protected and anonymized What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period?

THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.NA Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED.
