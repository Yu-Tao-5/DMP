The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning.

Statistical process control (SPC) was put forward as a method  \nthat enables this detection, potentially allowing us to identify signs of upcoming depression early on and to  \nintervene accordingly. However, there are still several barriers to the clinical implementation of SPC, which  \nthis project seeks to address.

I own intellectual property rights over the resulting publication(s) and materials. 3.Documentation and Metadata FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 7Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .Codebooks were provided by the EMOTE team, and contain information on variable names, the exact phrasing of questions, answer scales, and other information necessary to understand the data. Further, I created an overview of the properties of each dataset, detailing the methods of each study (e.g., assessment frequency, duration of the study, reimbursement of participants, etc.). Both resources files will be stored as Excel files in the same folder as the data. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: The overview of each study’s methods will be made available on the Open Science Framework. Codebooks belong to EMOTE and will therefore not be shared. These codebooks can however be requested from EMOTE using the identifier mentioned earlier (310Y9UYJLK). If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 8Where will the data be stored?

If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes: all data together now occupies 0.44 GB. This is low enough for efficient updates. ☐ No If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data Only I have access to OneDrive. Data will not be shared. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Costs are negligible. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): Sharepoint online What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Costs are negligible. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 106. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☐ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☒ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only). Note that approval has to be obtained from the EMOTE database team. ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Researchers can request the data from the emote database by referring to the identifier: 310Y9UYJLK. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☒ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify: The University of Melbourne holds the intellectual property rights over the existing data. I can therefore not share the data. However, other researchers can access the data by submitting a request at the EMOTE database. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Other data repository ( EMOTE database) ☐ Other (specify) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11When will the data be made available? ☐ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☒ Other (data can continuously be requested) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. Check the RDR guidance on licences for data and software sources code or consult the License selector tool to help you choose. ☐ CC-BY 4.0 (data) ☒ Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) . When requesting data at EMOTE, researchers are asked to comply with the data access terms. ☐ MIT licence (code) ☐ GNU GPL-3.0 (code) ☐ Other (specify) Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☒ My dataset already has a PID ☐ No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? None. Data sharing is handled by EMOTE. 7.
