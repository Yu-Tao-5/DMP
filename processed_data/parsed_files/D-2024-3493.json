It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all materials that need proper management because they are valuable, difficult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentation/metadata. RDM Guidance on data If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type. Protocols & SOPs: Protocols delivered in frequently used kits or existing standard lab protocols. DNA sequences: existing DNA sequences from GenBank, Addgene, published literature Protein amino acid sequences : fluorescent proteins, selection markers, etc. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number.☐ Yes, human subject data; provide SMEC or EC approval number: ☐ Yes, animal data; provide ECD reference number: ☐ Yes, dual use; provide approval number: ☒ No Additional information: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 8Will you process personal data4? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number).☐ Yes (provide PRET G-number or EC S-number below) ☒ No Additional information: Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin- offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please comment: Any RNA thermometer or terminator sequence can be used in industrial biotechnology strains via co-development agreements or licensing of individual parts. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3.Documentation and Metadata 4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .Each experiment is documented in an electronic lab notebook on Benchling by the performing scientist following standard operating procedures (SOPs), which will be or have been written down. Each notebook has a table of summary containing the background and rational with the objective, protocols and samples used, results and conclusions, linking to other notebooks as needed. The raw data of each experiment will be sorted per experiment type and stored in separate folders. Processed data will be stored in separate folders with the same name containing links to their respective raw data files. Separate documents of non-experimental nature will be sorted and stored in a documents folder. README.txt files will be included explaining the design/protocol, analysis methods, results, labels used and references to the electronic lab notebook, following the relevant reporting guidelines per experiment type (e.g. MIFlowCyt for flow cytometry experiments). Metadata will link the data files, lab samples, and experimental notes (including descriptions of equipment, setting, and used experimental settings). New folders will be created for processed data with links to the raw data included when needed for specific publications. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: When depositing data in a local or public repository, the final dataset will be accompanied with a README.txt file containing all relevant information, following the Dublin Core Metadata standard ( if no other meta-standard is available yet). This file will be located in the top-level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used. This will add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse within and outside of the lab. If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data.☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☒ Teams ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ ManGO ☒ Digital vault ☐ Other: How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? ☐ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☒ Personal back-ups I make (specify) ☒ Other (specify) Syncthing is being used to create an automated backup service both onsite and offsite, relying on personal machines from Prof. Pinheiro. This creates redundancy with data stored in multiple secure locations. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data OneDrive for business is secured using the KU Leuven data security systems and authentication. Syncthing creates a peer-to-peer encrypted network that must be authorized by both machines via a randomly-generated 128-bit key. Both ends must authorize the sharing of a folder before syncthing will allow data transfer.The network itself was set up in the Pinheiro lab as a spoke and hub model, with the spoke (individual researchers) only able to deposit data into the hub (onsite). The hub is backed up to an offsite secure server. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?OneDrive for business is free for researchers based at KU Leuven. Similarly, syncthing is free to use. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 115. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( long-term for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specify): Open Science Foundation What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?At present, the amount of data generated falls within the free data storage allocation. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS.
