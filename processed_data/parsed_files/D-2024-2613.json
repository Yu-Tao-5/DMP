The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Daan Dierickx (0000-0002-8917-022X )\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Jan Cools (0000-0001-6626-5843), head Laboratory for Molecular Biology of Leukemia  \nMarlies Vanden Bempt ( 0000-0003-0111-0263), postdoc Laboratory Experimental Hematology\nFlore Sneyers (0000-0003-0329-7973), postdoc L aboratory Experimental Hematology\nProject number 1 & title Molecular characterization of rare lymphomas to uncover new biomarkers and treatment targets\nFunder(s) GrantID 2 18B5824N\nAffiliation(s) x KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

We aim to investigate biomarkers that  \nwould identify patient at risk and also predict response to treatment. In parallel, as existing therapies are  \noften toxic or have increased risk for graft rejection, we plan to investigate new therapeutic targets to  \nimprove outcome. In WP1, starting from whole genome sequencing data , we will explore mechanisms of  \nboth  EBV+ and EBV-  DLBCL-PTLD aiming to  provide an integrated insight in the genomic and biological  \nlandscape of both EBV+ and EBV- PTLD, identifying (1) predictive and prognostic biomarkers and (2) new  \ntherapeutic targets.\nTo gain a better understanding of the underlying Peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) biology, we have started  \nto fully characterize the genetic and transcriptomic landscape of PTCL using combined whole genome and  \ntranscriptome sequencing of a cohort of 28 clinical PTCL cases. This effort led to the identification of the  \nnovel FYN-TRAF3IP2 fusion gene and other new genetic aberrations. In line with previous studies, we found  \nthat the mutational landscape of PTCL is heterogeneous, with many genetic alterations occurring at low  \nfrequencies. Interestingly, approximately half of the patients presented with a genetic abnormality in one or  \nmore components of the T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway. Therefore, deregulated TCR signaling may  \nact as a driver in PTCL pathogenesis, paving the way for novel targeted therapies applicable to a larger subset  \nof PTCL patients. In addition, mutations in epigenetic factors are frequently found in PTCL, indicating an  \nimportant driver role for epigenetic deregulation.  In WP2 and WP3 we aim to investigate how the different  \nnewly identified TCR signaling and epigenetic mutations contribute to T cell lymphoma development.  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

How will these costs be covered?70 Euro per TB per year. We have budgeted the costs for data storage (especially for large sequencing data files) on the fund for lymphoma research, which is managed by prof. Daan Dierickx. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specify): next-generation sequencing data is deposited at GEO. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?We have budgeted the costs for data storage (especially for large sequencing data files) on the fund for lymphoma research, which is managed by prof. Daan Dierickx. Data storage at GEO is free. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 116. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☒ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.For sequencing data from primary human samples, we will work with a data transfer agreement. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12Where will the data be made available?
