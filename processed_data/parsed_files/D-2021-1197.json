It led to new\nregulation for collective \ninvestment funds to improve non-financial risk management and\nencourage sustainable investments. To achieve the latter goal, it \nshould be clear for investors\nhow a sustainable fund can be \ndifferentiated from a conventional one. This classification remains\nuncharted territory from a legal perspective and comes with certain \nchallenges. The legal\ndefinition of a sustainable fund is opaque. Its coexistence \nwith existing regulations and nationally\norganised private and public \nlabels is unclear. There is also no explicit link with other regulations\nthat aim to encourage sustainable investments, most notably the \nlegal definition of a sustainable\neconomic activity. The law governing \nthe distributors that match these funds to investors'\nsustainability \npreferences makes no reference to this legal classification either. \nThis\nfragmentation leads to unclarity about the legal meaning of \nsustainability and may discourage\ninvestors from investing \nsustainably. The objective of this project is to identify the sets of\nobligations \napplicable to sustainable investment funds that distinguish them from \nconventional\nfunds and evaluate the coherence of that legal \nframework.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
