It addresses the highly prevalent prolonged use of these medications by considering diverse patient\ncharacteristics\nand outcomes. It explores the concept of adequate care in ambulatory settings. Notably, the project identifies trends and opportunities\nfor clinical phenotyping through a scoping review, and continues to create patient phenotypes based on medical history analysis, clinical\npractice research data, and patient interviews. The planned realist evaluation of adequacy of care involves studying patient experiences\nregarding timeliness, quality and quantity of care, and key processes in care; as well as their outcomes of medication use and/or\ntapering. Informed by the research results and context analysis, a model for personalised care will be developed and validated, with a\nplan for adaptation to local contexts. This way the project aims to a) contribute significantly to deprescribing research, b) improve\naccess to care, patient outcomes, and health equity, and c) fill existing gaps in research related to long-term psychotropic medication\nuse. PACe anticipates international impact through collaborations with key experts in the field across Europe and Canada, and the\napplicant aspires to establish an international network for future research and collaboration.\nID: \nID: \n211413\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-10-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n30-09-2025\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n29-01-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
