CP causes a broad range of impairments in motor control and\nmusculoskeletal function that impair walking ability (gait). Two thirds of the children with CP are\nambulatory and most of them receive orthopedic surgery, i.e. single-event multilevel surgery\n(SEMLS), to correct bony deformities and muscle contractures in their early teens. Unfortunately,\nSEMLS does not improve gait in 1 out of 4 children. Predictive simulations of movement have\ngreat potential to improve clinical decision making by allowing orthopedic surgeons to compare\nthe outcome of different treatment options before entering surgery. Yet the ability of predictive\nsimulations to capture the effect of SEMLS on the gait in CP remains to be demonstrated.\nFurthermore, existing simulations do not capture foot deformities while 93% of the children with\nCP develop such deformities. Feet form the interface between the body and ground and therefore\nfoot mechanics has an effect on whole body movement, further stressing the importance of\nimproving foot models. We therefore aim at developing a personalized dynamic foot model and\nto integrate it into the predictive simulations of gait which is crucial to bring this promising tool\ninto clinical practice.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
