Ethical and legal issues\n3.1. Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you\nwill use. Add the reference to the file in KU Leuven's Record of Processing Activities.\nBe aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNo\n3.2. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s).\nNo\n3.3. Does your research possibly result in research data with potential for tech\ntransfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If\nso, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted?\nYes\nIf the data has potential for valorization, the concept/material/device will be registered first and\npublished afterward. The data will be reused under the licence Creative Commons Attribution-\nNonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC-BY-NC-ND).\n3.4. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the\ndata you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions regarding\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 6\nreuse and sharing are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\n4.1. What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of the\ndata collected/generated in this project?\nOur group joined the pilot program, iRODS, developed by the Research Data Management\nCompetence Center (RDM-CC) at KU Leuven to standardize data and metadata. This allows us to\ndefine metadata for different data collections. For instance, we can assign fields like \"user\",\n\"project\", \"instrument\", \"date\" to each of our files. The files will be stored in a university-owned\nserver, free of charge and without space limitation. \"ReadMe\" txt files will be provided as legends\nfor the metadata fields and attributes.\nRegarding other kinds of generated data:\n1. Lab books will be classified by author and project. The inputs written in the lab books will be\norganized by date.\n2. Microscopy images will be accompanied by a scale bar and a txt \"ReadMe\" file detailing the\nconditions of the measurement (light intensity, contrast, magnification, etc.). The conditions will\nbe also annotated in the lab books.\n3. Standard equipment such as XRD, SEM, and EDS generates a metadata file with the measuring\nconditions. This file will be retained. The conditions will be also annotated in the lab book.\n \nFor the research data concerning the simulation work (D. Escudero): \nDuring research, data will be stored on computers belonging to the Quantum Chemistry and\nPhysical Chemistry Division (QCPC) and to the Flemish Supercomputing Centre. Key data will\nalways be backed up regularly to avoid loss of data (i.e., this is done on a daily basis in our\ncluster at the QCPC). Generally to unambiguously trace and organize data; the data arising from\nthe simulations (inputs&outputs) will be collected in separate folders per simulation test,\nincluding a txt file with a clear description of what the data represent and how they were\ngenerated. A common protocol to name and store data for this project will be set up among all\nproject members. Scripts, codes, input&output files will unambiguosly display date of creation\nand who generated the data.\n4.2. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be\nused. If not, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nThe data will be stored in folders named as the user. Then, each user will create its own folder\nstructure. Metadata referring to the date, project, equipment, type of data (paper, raw data,\npresentation, etc.) ... will be assigned to each file. This feature is enabled by the iRODS platform\nput in place by KU Leuven.\nThe metadata attributes used for search are summarized in txt \"ReadMe\" files.\nWe will name the successive file versions as xxx_V1, xxx_V2, etc. Also, the date when the file was\ngenerated will be used to track the version.\nThe relevant datasets (except for some unpublished SOPs and other files related to the group\nknow-how) will be uploaded in OpenAIRE or Zenodo under a license. Hence, they will receive a\nDOI for identification.\nConcerning the simulation work (D. Escudero): The PI has considerable expertise in curating\ncomputational chemistry research data with these types of approach. All data (appropriately\ncollected and classified with a clear description of what the data represent and how they\nwere generated) will be preserved for at least 10 years (this is the standard protocol at the QCPC\ndivision.\n5. Data storage and backup during the project\n5.1. Where will the data be stored?\nAll the data generated by Pof. Molina-Lopez's group will be first produced and stored in personal\ncomputers in the Department of Materials Engineering (MTM) drives, and immediately shared in\niRODS.\nThe KU Leuven Box space will be used to share data with external visitors and master students. \nEach researcher will be responsible to transfer the data from their personal computer to the\nshared spaces.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 6\nThe others PIs will follow their usual proceducer to store data. For instance, for the simulation\nwork (D. Escudero): Full output from all calculations is very voluminous, but the field has\nstandard protocols for collecting the key data. Specifically, data will be stored in our\ncomputers belonging to the Quantum Chemistry and Physical Chemistry Division (QCPC,\nKU Leuven) and on the data storage services of the Flemish Supercomputing Centre (VSC).\n \n5.2. How will the data be backed up?\nThe iRODS and BOX systems provides continuous and automatic backups.\nFor the simulation work (D. Escudero): Automatic daily back-up procedures are ensured at both\nour QCPC cluster as well as at the VSC facilities.\n5.3. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes, virtually unlimited.\n5.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nThere are no extra costs expectedf for MTM. \n5.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not\naccessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nEach university-associated computer requires a password for logging in. This password must be\nchanged every year. Access to the iRODS and KU Leuven Box space is also protected by a\npassword. No sensitive data will be handled in this project. Each research will have access to\ntheir own data and the PI (Francisco Molina-Lopez) will have access to the data of every member\nof the project.\nThe other PIs will manage their data following their usual procedures.\n6. Data preservation after the end of the project\n6.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the\nproject? If only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is\nthe case (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nPhysical data in the form of lab books and samples will be retained for 5 years. Most samples will\ndegrade with time and will not be usable after 5 years in any case. Due to space restrictions, lab\nbooks will be retained also for 5 years. Digital data will be retained for 10 years.\n6.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)?\nSamples and lab books will be stored for 5 years in dedicated cabinets and drawers in the labs.\nDigital data will be retained for 10 years on internal KU Leuven data storage facilities. Storing in\na repository (such as Zenodo) will be considered.\n6.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How\nwill the costs be covered?\nNA\n7. Data sharing and re-use\n7.1. Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data\n(e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions or because of IP\npotential)?\nUnpublished data related to specific SOPs, and non-essential for reproducibility of claimed results\nwill not be shared.\n7.2. Which data will be made available after the end of the project?\nThe full dataset (except for some unpublished SOPs and other know-how-related files) will be\nuploaded in Zenodo under a CC-BY license.\n7.3. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn an Open Access repository\nUpon request by mail\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n5 of 6\n7.4. When will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nAfter an embargo period. Specify the length of the embargo and why this is necessary\nPublished but embargoed data can be shared upon personal request by email. These data will be\ndeposited in the Lirias KU Leuven repository. The embargo period is usually 6 months for most\njournals in the field.\n7.5. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nThe data will be available to anyone for any purpose, provided that they give appropriate credit\nto the creators. However unpublished SOPs and other know-how-related knowledge, which is\nnon-essential for the reproducibility of claimed results will not be shared.\n7.6. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nNA\n8. Responsibilities\n8.1. Who will be responsible for the data documentation & metadata?\nFrancisco Molina-Lopez, the PI of the project, will be responsible for data documentation\nproduced at MTM.\nDaniel Escudero and Guy Koeckelberghs, the co-promotors in the project, will be responsible for\ndata documentation produced at the department of Chemistry.\n8.2. Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nEach researcher will be responsible to transfer the data to the iRODS shared folders and/or Box\nshared folders. The backup of the data is automatic in those platforms.\n8.3. Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and sharing?\nFrancisco Molina-Lopez, the PI of the project, will be responsible for data preservation and reuse\nat MTM.\nDaniel Escudero and Guy Koeckelberghs, the co-promotors in the project, will be responsible for\ndata preservation and reuse at the department of Chemistry.\n8.4. Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nThe end responsibility for updating and implementing the DMP is with the supervisors (promotor\nand co-promotors).\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n6 of 6"
