If so, please \ndescribe these issues further and  refer to specific datasets or data \ntypes when appropriate.  Yes, animal data. Ethical approval for animal \nexperiments has already been granted \n(P195/2020  and P107/2023). This applies to \ndata resulting from animal experiments, \nincluding ‘tumour volume measurements’ \nand ‘FACS data’.  \nWill you process personal data 1? If so, briefly describe the kind of \npersonal data you will use. Please refer to specific datasets or \ndata types when appropriate. If available, add the reference to \nyour file in your host institution's privacy register.  No \nDoes your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. \ntech transfer , for example spin -offs, commercial exploitation, … )?  \nIf so, please comment per dataset  or data type where appropriate . Yes. We expect that our project will result in \nresearch data with potential for tech transfer \nand valorization. KU Leuven has a policy to \nactively monitor research data for such \npotential. If there is substantial potential, the \ninvention will be thoroughly  assessed, and in \nseveral cases the invention will be IP \nprotected (mostly patent protection or \ncopyright protection). As such the IP \nprotection does not withhold the research \ndata from being made public. In the case a \ndecision is taken to file a patent ap plication it \nwill be planned so that publications don't \nneed to be delayed.  We are currently already \nin contact with LRD and are following their \nguidelines.  \nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or \ndissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer \nagreements , research  collaboration agreements)?  \nIf so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions \nare in place.  No \nAre there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property \nrights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you \n(re)use?  \nIf so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions \nwill be asserted.  No \n \nDOCUMENTATION AND METADATA  \n \nClearly describe what approach will be followed to \ncapture the accompanying information necessary to \nkeep data understandable and usable , for yourself and \nothers, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of \ndocumentation levels and types required, procedures \nused, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, \nCodebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). \n Documentation will consist of electronic laboratory \nrecords, that contain all of the information of the \nperformed experiment itself (Excel sheet -based  \nmetadata files). Those notes will describe the biological \nsamples used/generated, experimental setup and \nprotocols used, results generated, the links to the \nspecific computer location as well as the names of the \nrespective datasets. We will also maintain a metadata \nsheet with the connection between lab samples and \nfiles on our data storage, so that data files , lab samples, \nand experimental notes remain properly linked. Detailed \nprotocols will be written, including research methods \nand practices for each experimental initiative. This will \nbe stored in Word or Excel files. Furthermore, a \nlogbook will be kept in Excel containing all steps that \nwere taken to develop the final methodology, date of \nimplementation and name of the researcher who \ncarried out the experiment. Algorithms, scripts and \nsoftware usage will be documented and stored \nalongside the electronic lab oratory records, e.g. \nGraphPad Prism, FlowJo. Finally, we will also keep all \nthe information (in dedicated Excel sheets, PDFs or \nWord -files) about purchased antibodies, cell -lines, \n \n \nmouse models and other analogue data -sources. Other \nrelevant information about these reagents and tools \n(e.g., proof of antibody specificity) will be derived from \ninitial standardization and optimization experiments and \nwill be retained along with general research \ndocumentation/meta -data files.  \nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to \nfind and reuse the data ?  \n \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard will be \nused. If not, please specify which metadata will be \ncreated to make the data easier to find and reuse.  \n Yes. We will use various metadata standards as \napplicable for different experiment/datatypes, as already \nestablished elsewhere: https://fairsharing.org/. For \ninstance, flow cytometry (https://flowrepository.org/), \nmicroscopy imaging (https://www.openmicros copy.org/), \nqRT-PCR (http://miqe.gene -quantification.info/), and \npublicly available TCGA patient data analyses \n(https://gdc.cancer.gov/aboutdata/ data -standards) have \nvery well -defined pre -established meta -data standards. \nIn case we do not have a metadata standard available \nfor a technique/datatype, a metadata of the numerical \ndatasets will be created manually (e.g. based on the \nDublin core metadata standard). For most of the data, \nmetadata will be provided as readme, word or excel files, \ncontaining all set tings and technical descriptions of the \nexperiment and data. In parallel, detailed meta -data info \nwill be integrated within the electronic laboratory records \nlinked to each experiment (as described above)  \n \n \n \nDATA STORAGE & BACK -UP DURING THE RESEARCH PROJECT   \n \nWhere will the data be stored?  Digital files will be stored on KU Leuven data storage \nservers. All data generated during the project will be \nstored on the local KU Leuven servers, PI computers, \nand backup hard drives, as well as on a local RAID \nstorage available in the office. This will  be initially \nlocated in the real -time folders (on lab provided \nlaptops/PCs of the students or employees and local KU \nLeuven servers) and later only in the archive folders \n(archive is mirrored; on local KU Leuven servers, \nbackup hard -drives as well as PI c omputers). Any \nalgorithms, scripts or softwares originally generated \nduring the project will be stored in private online git \nrepositories of the PIs. As soon as the manuscript is \npublicly available, the repository will be changed to a \npublic repository. Sp ecific biological samples (e.g. cell \nlysates, protein/nucleic acid samples) will be stored in a \nfreezer ( -20°C or -80°C) while cell lines will be stored in \nliquid nitrogen.  \nHow will the data be backed up?  Digital data will be stored on the university’s secure \nnetwork drives with automatic daily back -up procedures \n(e.g. JDrive for confidential data and KUL Enterprise \nBox for non -confidential data. Data is also stored as a \nbackup on lab computers, external ha rd drives, and on \na local RAID 50 system in the office.  \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity \nduring the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or \ninsufficient storage or backup capacities  are available, \nthen explain how this will be taken care of.  Yes. I n the various KUL storage services ( currently we \nhave > 1 TB free data -space at our disposal ), as well as \nthe 36Tb local RAID 50 system present in the office.  \n \n \nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored \nand not accessed or modified by unauthorized \npersons?  The “J -drive” and “KUL Enterprise Box” servers are \naccessible only by laboratory members and PIs . Local \nstorage systems like the RAID system and external \n hard drives are not accessible remotely and password \nprotected.  \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and \nbackup during the research project? How will these \ncosts be covered?  The total estimated cost of data storage during the \nproject is 500 EUR. This estimation is based on the \nfollowing costs: - The costs of digital data storage are \nas follows: approximately 52 EUR/100 GB/Year for the \n“J-drive” and approximately 10 EUR/100 GB/ Year for \nthe “KUL Enterprise Box”.  \n \n \n \nDATA PRESERVATION AFTER THE END OF THE RESEARCH PROJECT  \n \nWhich data will be retained for 10 years (or longer, in \nagreement with other retention policies that are \napplicable) after the end of the project? In case some \ndata cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for \nthis (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, instit utional policies...).  The minimum preservation term of 10 years after the \nend of the project will be applied to all relevant data . \nCell lines will also be stored for at least or more than 10 \nyears. Cell lysates and certain biological samples will \nbe stored for at least 5 years (beyond 5 years, the \ndegradation of these samples makes their storage \n“useless” and would require repeating the experiments \nto re-generate the data).    \nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated \nfor the long -term)?  Data will be stored as described in section 4, as well as \narchived using KU Leuven’s longterm storage/large \nvolume storage service.  \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation \nduring the expected retention period? How will these \ncosts be covered?  \n KU Leuven long term storage/large volume storage \nshould cost around 100€/TB/year. The total volume of \nrelevant data to be stored is expected to be significantly \nunder that. The costs for archival data will be paid \nupfront from the FWO project funds.  \n \n \nDATA SHARING AND REUSE   \n \nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for \nreuse after/during the project?   \nPlease explain per dataset or data type which data will \nbe made available.  \n Yes, as open data and as restricted data (after \napproval, institutional access only)  \nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to \naccess the data and under what conditions.  Access to data will be granted upon request.  \nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing \nof (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement \nwith a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?  \n No, unless IP is still under filing.  \nWhere will the data be made available?  \nIf already known, please provide a repository per \ndataset or data type.  Digital data will be made publicly available as per the \njournals’ data availability policy , or available upon email \nrequest to the PI. Data that do not support publication \nwill be made available upon reasonable request by \nemail.  \nWhen will the data be made available?   \n Upon publication of research results  \n \nWhich data usage licenses are you going to provide?  Creative Commons Licenses (CC BY) will be attached \nto the data deposited.  \nDo you intend to add a persistent identifier (PID) to your \ndataset(s), e.g. a DOI or accession number? If already \navailable, please provide it here.   \n Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data \nrepository  \nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will \nthese costs be covered?    \n No costs are expected for data sharing.  \n \nRESPONSIBILITIES   \n \nWho will manage data documentation and metadata \nduring the research project?   \n The Post Doc and technician  associated with this \nproject will be responsible for data documentation & \nmetadata, under supervision of the PI.  \n \nWho will manage data storage and backup during the \nresearch project?   \n Data management, storage and back up will be \nperformed by the PhD and technician associated with \nthis project, under supervision of the PI.    \n \nWho will manage data preservation and sharing?   \n The PI (Prof. Abhishek D Garg) will be responsible to \nensure data preservation and reuse.  \n \nWho will update and implement this DMP?   \n The PI bears the end responsibility of updating & \nimplementing this DMP . \n \n \n "
