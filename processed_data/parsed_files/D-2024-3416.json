Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data. ☐ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I -drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on -premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☐ Other: Copies can be made and kept on personal professional devices that fall under the university' secure environment. All people with access to these data use multi -factor authentication. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? ☒ Standard back -up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☒ Personal back -ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) The Onedrive assures a storage using online cloud services. In addition, the coded research data might be backed -up on local external hard drives that are encrypted and password -protected. These hard drives do not contain personal data that are easily identifiable (e. g. no participant names etc.). Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If no, please specify : How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . Guidance on security for research data Password protection and multi -factor authentication. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9 What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? No substantial costs expected, except the purchase of a few external hard drives. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). Guidance on data preservation ☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be ke pt for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data . Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide . ☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): Currently we archive coded research data in full on encrypted & password -protected external hard drives stored in two different rooms, with partial archiving in openly accessible platforms. We expect this to change in the first part of the project duration, once a more specific plan can be developed with the dedicated support staff. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10 What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? With current policies, we expect a total cost of around 1000 euro, and probably a higher cost with future policies. This can be covered from the project budget. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE ’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE , CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY . AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS . FOR MORE INFORMATION : HTTPS ://WIKI.SURFNET .NL/DISPLAY /STANDARDS /INFO-EU- REPO /#INFOEUREPO -ACCESS RIGHTS ☒ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☐ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☒ Other, please specify: Upon request by email. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Fully open access as much as possible (if allowed by ethical committee) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11 Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☒ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify : The research data can be shared (anonymously) with other researchers, also on online databases. This is explicitly mentioned in the informed consent forms signed by the participants. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. ☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Other data repository (specify) ☒ Other (specify) Upon request by email. We typically share the final analyses files and further experimental material (stimuli etc.) using the OSF platform, which is an international standard frequently used in the domain of psychology (e.g., https://osf.io/ ). Other options will be explored. When will the data be made available? ☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☐ Other (specify) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12 Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS . IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED , THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED . DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT . Check the RDR guidance on licences for data and software sources code or consult the License selector tool to help you choose. ☒ CC-BY 4.0 (data) ☐ Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) ☐ MIT licence (code) ☐ GNU GPL -3.0 (code) ☐ Other (specify) Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here . INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA . ☒ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☐ No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? The solutions that we currently use (OSF, g -node) have no costs (at the moment). 7. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project? The FWO doctoral fellow and the supervisor/promotor (the former is the first contact point). Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project? The FWO doctoral fellow and the supervisor/promotor (the former is the first contact point). Who will manage data preservation and sharing? The FWO doctoral fellow and the supervisor/promotor (the former is the first contact point). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13 Who will update and implement this DMP? The FWO doctoral fellow."
