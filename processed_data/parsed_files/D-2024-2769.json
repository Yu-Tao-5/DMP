I also use a chronological and logical folder structure to\norganise all my data.\nI strive to make my design databases or measurement data organised in such a way that other users can understand my workspace and use\nthe needed data when necessary. \nFull-custom IC design:\n   Projects:\nCustom IC designs using Cadence Virtuoso are managed on a project basis. A project is defined for each chip. When the chip is taped-\nout, the project will be archived as a snapshot of the current design (see below).\nEach project will be given a codename, which allows to make a distinction between different versions of a chip. We don’t use\n<ATOMOS> and <ATOMOS_v2>. A list is maintained with all current and past chips. No duplicate names should be used.\n \n    Libraries:\nVirtuoso manages its projects using libraries. A general principle is to use only a single library for your designs, unless it makes sense to\ncreate a separate library that contains cross-project IP (e.g. IO, ESD protection, digital gates).\nI’ll create a separate library for testbenches. Ideally, each testbench has the same name as the test-fixtures with an extension that describes\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 27 February 2024\n6 of 10\nthe function of the test. (e.g. oscillator_tb_phasenoise ; amplifier_core_tb_gain)\nGood practice: libraries < ATOMOS>  and  <ATOMOS_testbench>\nBad practice: libraries < ATOMOS>  < ATOMOS_v2> < ATOMOS_digitallogic> <ATOMOS_currentsources>\n <ATOMOS_testbench>  < ATOMOS_other>\n    Cellviews\nI aim to show the hierarchy of the design in the namespace of the cells. (e.g. PLLtopVcoCurrentreference highlights the cell Current\nreference in the submodule VCO of PLLtop)\nI’ll avoid using versions at cell level and making copies of copies. (e.g. <flipflop>,<flipflop_v2>,<flipflop_olddesign>,\n<flipflop_top><flipflop_final><flipflop_final2>). \nThe same applies for views (“schematic”, “layout”, …).\nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data?

There will\nbe normalize data, conclusions and figures available. \n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nWhere will the data be stored?\nBasic info: \nKU Leuven provides a 1TB OneDrive service for each staff member, linked to your KU Leuven account.\nWe use OneDrive to share non-development and non-confidential data like publications, training material, teaching material, … within\nthe research group. \nDesign specific data should not be shared through OneDrive. \nSimulation results\nGenerally, we do not save simulation results. We only maintain and archive the testbenches. Each testbench should clearly indicate the\nresults produced.\nSimulation results are saved to the “no_backup” folder of my Linux home directory to save backup disk space. This folder has no backup.\nI make sure to temporarily clean my “simulation” folder.\nSimulation results are presented to my promotor once every two weeks. These update reports are maintained along with my chip\ndatabase. The title of my report (e.g. pptx file) correlates to the content of the simulation (e.g. flipflop_sim_setuphold_02042021.pptx).\nThis report is updated every time I do some work on my research.\nMeasurement results\nMeasurement results vary significantly depending on the measurement equipment used. For hardware measurements, there is no\nindustry-standard approach to annotate data. I include the following metadata for my measurement data:\nInstrument name-type used to produce the data\nConfiguration script used to generate data\nEnvironmental conditions (if any specific)\nHardware revision\nTimestamp\nA snapshot of the measurement results is made after each test campaign. A test campaign could be a test in RELYlab or a test using a\nradiation source, cryo station, etc.\nThe snapshot should be runnable and annotated with a README file that identifies different measurement results or associated\nprocessing scripts.\nWe do not recommend specific data formats since this might be very specific for each measurement equipment. Generally we try to use\neither MATLAB or Python to process data.\nAt least a concluding report should be included in this snapshot that highlights the measurement approach and results. It is recommended\nto include some pictures of the test setup.\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 27 February 2024\n7 of 10\nThe snapshot should at least include:\nraw measurement data\nprocessing scripts\nhardware design files (e.g. PCB design if any)\nFPGA/MCU firmware (if any)\nPC software (if any).\nHow will the data be backed up?\nHow will the data be backed up?\nLinux Backup\nWe rely on backup services provided by the Dept. Electrical Engineering (ESAT). A backup of my Linux folder is made periodically by\nthe system group. \nNo backup is made of the folder “no_backup”.\n \nWindows Backup\nWe are recommended the usage of Linux account as much as possible since it is securely managed and backups are provided.\nGenerally, no backup is provided for my personal windows laptop. I personally back-up all my research documents on my KU Leuven\nOneDrive by putting them in my OneDrive folder which provides adequate safety for data loss. \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project?

This back-up is unlimited. \nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nDuring the design phase, multiple people might need access to my design. At least my promotor might require access to my design.\nWe use Github to synchronize a design with multiple users. The same platform is used to archive the design.\nSome libraries might be shared with other people, for instance generic IP libraries (like IO/ESD). I need to contact the maintainer of the library\nfor any changes.\nThe stored data is secured by the Linux server where you can only get acces via a secured SSH link and the OneDrive is secured with a two\nstep authenticator provided by KU Leuven. \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project?

Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). Basic info: I ensure research data are stored safely (data loss) and securely (data protection). I strive for a clear naming of my data and annotate my data as much as possible. I also use a chronological and logical folder structure to organise all my data. I strive to make my design databases or measurement data organised in such a way that other users can understand my workspace and use the needed data when necessary. Full-custom IC design: Projects: Custom IC designs using Cadence Virtuoso are managed on a project basis. A project is defined for each chip. When the chip is taped- out, the project will be archived as a snapshot of the current design (see below). Each project will be given a codename, which allows to make a distinction between different versions of a chip. We don’t use <ATOMOS> and <ATOMOS_v2>. A list is maintained with all current and past chips. No duplicate names should be used. Libraries: Virtuoso manages its projects using libraries. A general principle is to use only a single library for your designs, unless it makes sense to create a separate library that contains cross-project IP (e.g. IO, ESD protection, digital gates). I’ll create a separate library for testbenches. Ideally, each testbench has the same name as the test-fixtures with an extension that describes Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 27 February 2024 6 of 10 the function of the test. (e.g. oscillator_tb_phasenoise ; amplifier_core_tb_gain) Good practice: libraries < ATOMOS> and <ATOMOS_testbench> Bad practice: libraries < ATOMOS> < ATOMOS_v2> < ATOMOS_digitallogic> <ATOMOS_currentsources> <ATOMOS_testbench> < ATOMOS_other> Cellviews I aim to show the hierarchy of the design in the namespace of the cells. (e.g. PLLtopVcoCurrentreference highlights the cell Current reference in the submodule VCO of PLLtop) I’ll avoid using versions at cell level and making copies of copies. (e.g. <flipflop>,<flipflop_v2>,<flipflop_olddesign>, <flipflop_top><flipflop_final><flipflop_final2>). The same applies for views (“schematic”, “layout”, …).

No The Datasets of the experiments can’t be published do to legal reasons, this is why it won’t be necessary to use a metadata standard. There will be normalize data, conclusions and figures available. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Basic info: KU Leuven provides a 1TB OneDrive service for each staff member, linked to your KU Leuven account. We use OneDrive to share non-development and non-confidential data like publications, training material, teaching material, … within the research group. Design specific data should not be shared through OneDrive. Simulation results Generally, we do not save simulation results. We only maintain and archive the testbenches. Each testbench should clearly indicate the results produced. Simulation results are saved to the “no_backup” folder of my Linux home directory to save backup disk space. This folder has no backup. I make sure to temporarily clean my “simulation” folder. Simulation results are presented to my promotor once every two weeks. These update reports are maintained along with my chip database. The title of my report (e.g. pptx file) correlates to the content of the simulation (e.g. flipflop_sim_setuphold_02042021.pptx). This report is updated every time I do some work on my research. Measurement results Measurement results vary significantly depending on the measurement equipment used. For hardware measurements, there is no industry-standard approach to annotate data. I include the following metadata for my measurement data: Instrument name-type used to produce the data Configuration script used to generate data Environmental conditions (if any specific) Hardware revision Timestamp A snapshot of the measurement results is made after each test campaign. A test campaign could be a test in RELYlab or a test using a radiation source, cryo station, etc. The snapshot should be runnable and annotated with a README file that identifies different measurement results or associated processing scripts. We do not recommend specific data formats since this might be very specific for each measurement equipment. Generally we try to use either MATLAB or Python to process data. At least a concluding report should be included in this snapshot that highlights the measurement approach and results. It is recommended to include some pictures of the test setup. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 27 February 2024 7 of 10 The snapshot should at least include: raw measurement data processing scripts hardware design files (e.g. PCB design if any) FPGA/MCU firmware (if any) PC software (if any). How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Linux Backup We rely on backup services provided by the Dept. Electrical Engineering (ESAT). A backup of my Linux folder is made periodically by the system group. No backup is made of the folder “no_backup”. Windows Backup We are recommended the usage of Linux account as much as possible since it is securely managed and backups are provided. Generally, no backup is provided for my personal windows laptop. I personally back-up all my research documents on my KU Leuven OneDrive by putting them in my OneDrive folder which provides adequate safety for data loss. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.

Yes KU Leuven provides a 2TB OneDrive service for each staff member, linked to your KU Leuven account. We rely on backup services provided by the Dept. Electrical Engineering (ESAT). A backup of my Linux folder is made periodically by the system group. This back-up is unlimited. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? During the design phase, multiple people might need access to my design. At least my promotor might require access to my design. We use Github to synchronize a design with multiple users. The same platform is used to archive the design. Some libraries might be shared with other people, for instance generic IP libraries (like IO/ESD). I need to contact the maintainer of the library for any changes. The stored data is secured by the Linux server where you can only get acces via a secured SSH link and the OneDrive is secured with a two step authenticator provided by KU Leuven.

Last modiﬁed 27 February 2024 8 of 10 Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Design libraries are archived when the chip is sent to the foundry I leave the research group. This allows to maintain a 1-to-1 mapping of the chip-to-design and allows the research group to further develop the chip when I leave. When making an archive, the active project is copied to a backup project which can be accessed as a normal project, without write permissions. Generally, archives are never deleted. Upon making an archive, I will check the data size of the project and aim to optimise for long-term storage (e.g. check for top-level parasitic extractions which could exceed GB) All of this will be archived on the previous mentioned Linux server.
