These\nmild electrophiles are attractive as irreversible warheads in chemical biology, notably in activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) where chemical probes\nare used to identify and study enzymes via ligation to nucleophilic side chains. Where previous work almost exclusively focused on sulfonyl (SO2)\nbased sulfur(VI)-fluorides, no attention since the rise of SuFEx chemistry has been spent on thiazyl fluorides, S\n≡\nN-triple bonded, stable structures with\nvery few known applications. The most promising progenitor to thiazyl derivatives is the parent thiazyl trifluoride (N\n≡\nSF3), a highly stable gas.\nHowever, no useable lab-scale preparation exists to this hub, and therefore entire classes of azasulfur derivatives are unattainable for lack of synthetic\nentry. In this project, I will tackle this availability hurdle by developing a universal route to all mono- and difunctionalized thiazyl fluoride derivatives,\nby using only commercial, solid reagents. Next, I will extend this protocol to include sulfondiimidoyl fluorides, another class of azasulfur structures that\nhave no precedents for substituents other than carbon. Lastly, I will make alkynylated activity-based probes to explore the reactivity of these new\nwarheads towards whole proteomes using gel-based fluorescence readout, and analyze hits using an LC-MS/MS proteomics workflow.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n30-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

No The metadata describing how experiments were run are generated by the software of the experimental setups. This information can be retrieved using the acquisition software and typically is in proprietary format except in a few cases where the metadata is in the form of plain text files. Each experiment will be described in the ELN with reference to the raw/processed data in the DMP project folder. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? For the active data, the data is automatically backed up via OneDrive. ELN data will be stored in MBook cloud which provides backup. At the end of the project, the OneDrive DMP datafolder will be migrated to an Archive storage hosted on KU Leuven servers. This archive storage is backed up automatically. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS.
