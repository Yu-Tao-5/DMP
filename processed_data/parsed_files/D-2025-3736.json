Videos, IMUs and HR data will be collected using an app allowing timesynchronized collection. Steps of pre- and postprocessing of data and feature calculation will be well documented within the software code, making every step from raw data to features reproducable.

Patientcharacteristics such as Diagnosis, medication related to movement disorder, age (year/month), weight, body length, gender, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and Manual Ability Classification (MACS) will be collected and stored in the eCRF (REDCap). The results of scoring of the videos of three raters will also be uploaded to the eCRF. Measured raw data will be stored at Large Volume Storage (L-drive) of KU Leuven, specially developed to store large amount of data for longer periods of time and suitable for sensitive data. Amsterdam UMC data will be stored locally. Only pseudomized data will be merged for machine learning. Data transfer of pseudomized data will be transfered in a secure way (i.e. by surfsend.surf.nl or filensender belnet) Study documentation will be stored on a shared reaseach team folder on KU Leuven OneDrive.For an effective data managment ManGO of KU Leuven will be used. The paper copies of the informed consent forms will be stored in a secured locker at the Department of Rehabilitation Science, Campus Bruges of KU Leuven and at the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at Amsterdam UMC, respectively. Only authorized personnel will have access to this locked storage room. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Standard back-up will be provided via the KU Leuven secure network drive with automatic daily backup procedures. Addidionally, a mirror of the data is provided in a second ICTS data center for buisness continuity or disaster recovery purposes. At Amsterdam UMC similar backup procedure are in place. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Sufficient storage and backup capacitiy for data - as described in part 1 of this DMP - is provided on the KU Leuven and Amsterdam UMC servers and networks. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The digital pseudonymous data (i.e. coded and containing no personal information) and the non-pseudonymous data (i.e. video data) will be stored in secure university envrionment. The PI of this project will be the only one who can grant access to this network drive. Access to the study folder on the on L:/drive is secured by a two-factor authenticated password protection. Data within the eCRF is only accessable for unauthorized person with logging of changes. Created using DMPonline.be.

In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). The standard advice of the Research Ethics Committee of UZ/KU Leuven for data storage is to keep data on a highly secured network drive (i.e. K-drive) for a minimum of 25 years after completion of the study. This is with a view to reproduction, verification, and potential reuse of research data. Video data will only be kept if we have additional consent of the participant/guardian. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?

How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? For the final year of the project an additional part in the budget is foreseen for data archiving (K-drive) for a period of 5 years. The expected costs are €12,84/year/100Gb. Costs related to archiving will be covered for 50% by the Department of Biomedical Sciences and for 50% by the project. 5. Data sharing and reuse 5.
