The first aim is to build a conceptual\nframework on identity of these persons, based on theories from different disciplines as well as on\nexperiential and practical knowledge of family and professional carers. Secondly, a toolkit with\ninnovative methods, practical tools and strategies will be developed, that will enable carers to\naccess and to record the explicit, observable and tacit knowledge on a personâ€™s identity. The\nthird aim is to implement and evaluate the developed toolkit into daily life and care. This\nprojectâ€™s results will contribute to evidence-based methods, tools and strategies, which are\nessential to change the long term health care towards more person-centered care for persons\nwith high support needs.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Ethical and legal issues\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 5\n3.1. Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you\nwill use. Add the reference to the file in KU Leuven's Record of Processing Activities.\nBe aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nPersonal data will be used. This will consist of directly identifiable data that will be pseudomised\nconcering name, age, adres, contact information and health data. Special categories of personal\ndata will also be used, more specifically it is neccesary for this project to collect data concerning\nreligious or philosophical beliefs,\n health, sexual orientation and ethical background. \n3.2. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s).\nSMEC Research approved G-2022-4759 on 23-2-2022 (focusgroups)\nSMEC Research pending G-2021-4413 (ECD, cultural probes)\nCTC approval pending, will be followed up by EC Research.\n3.3. Does your research possibly result in research data with potential for tech\ntransfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If\nso, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNot relevant\n3.4. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the\ndata you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions regarding\nreuse and sharing are in place?\nNot relevant\n4. Documentation and metadata\n4.1. What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of the\ndata collected/generated in this project?\n1. For the survey data a codebook will be generated containing study design, sampling\nmethodology, variable-level information (lael, question text, codes, frequencies).\n2. For the data resulting from interviews and focus groups details on the contexts of the\ninterview, discussion, focus groups the consent giving process, the questions asked (or subjects\ndiscussed) and the instructions (or predefined scenario) will be shared in a Word and/or excel\ndocument. \n3. The data coming from cultural probes will be documented with information on the setup of the\nprobe exercise (what type of format, what type of questions/assignments given, etc.), the\ndetailed instructions and the contexts in which it was used.\n4. Data coming from testing notes will be documented with testing setups, type of prototypes\ntested, instruction to testing leaders and contexts of the testing setup.\nFor all data: The researchers will pseudomise the data.\n4.2. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be\nused. If not, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nThis will be determined later on in the project.\n5. Data storage and backup during the project\n5.1. Where will the data be stored?\nThe questionnaire, informed consent and the COVID-19 information papers that return by e-mail\nwill be saved on the secured network drive of KU Leuven (OneDrive). \nAll Microsoft Excel and / or Microsoft Word sheets used during this project will be saved on the\nsecured network drive of KU Leuven (OneDrive).\nThe statements collected during the focus groups and the prioritizing and categorizing task will\nbe inserted and analyzed using R-CMap. These files will also be saved on the secured network\ndrive of KU Leuven (OneDrive).\nObservations stored in a physical notebook will later be digitalised on the encrypted KU Leuven\n(OneDrive). Video or audio recordings of the participants interacting with the tools during ECD, or\nduring significant moments when designing by immersion will also be saved on\n the secured\nnetwork drive of KU Leuven (OneDrive).\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 5\nThe physical cultural probes will be stored by the involved researcher in a locker that can only be\naccessed by him/herself at LUCA Genk campus. After the collection of the cultural probes, this\nphysical data will be pseudonymized and digitalised. The digitalised PDF version of the cultural\nprobe will stored online on the secured network drive of KU Leuven (OneDrive). Online stored\ndata will be organized in different files according to content (ex. all sleeping habits in one file).\nThe physical data will also be reorganized according to the content. One cultural probe used by a\nspecific person will not be stored in its entirety in one place. After the project has been finalised,\nall paper data will be handed over to the supervisor of the project (Niels Hendriks) who will store\nthese data in their office in a locked drawer or cupboard that can only be accessed by himself.\nFiles stored on the shared KULeuven OneDrive of the project will only be available to access by\nthe neccesary researchers. \n5.2. How will the data be backed up?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers (KU Leuven OneDrive) with automatic\ndaily back-up procedures.\n5.3. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nCurrently there is enough storage space on the KU Leuven OneDrive.\n5.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nAs the data generated will not contain large amounts of data, we expect the cost to be non-\nexisted or limited. The costs will be covered by the RU Inter-Actions.\n5.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not\naccessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nall the information is password protected on the secured KU Leuven OneDrive. The KU Leuven\nlogin of all researchers is is also equipped with multi-factor authentication to adequately protect\ndata and the researchers will work on encrypted laptops.\n6. Data preservation after the end of the project\n6.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the\nproject? If only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is\nthe case (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll e-mail addresses of the participants will be destroyed after the study. The informed consent\nforms and the other personal data will be kept up to 10 years after the publication. In addition,\nonly the researcher and supervisors will have access to the data stored on the KU Leuven\nOneDrive.\n6.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures)\nfor at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.\n6.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How\nwill the costs be covered?\nAs the data generated will not contain large amounts of data, we expect the cost to be non-\nexisted or limited. The costs will be covered by the RU Inter-Actions.\n7. Data sharing and re-use\n7.1. Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data\n(e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions or because of IP\npotential)?\nNo such restrictions are known\n7.2.

Data from interviews, focus groups, ECD, cultural probes and test\nsetups will be made available under a CC-BY License. when asked via email.\nAll data will have to be pseudomised before being made available.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 5\nAll data results will be shared in the form of publications. \n7.3. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nUpon request by mail\nOpen Science framework + Research catalogue \n7.4. When will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nNo privacy sensitive data will be shared.
