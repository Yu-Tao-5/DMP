KUL  provides  \n(dedicated) computing and workshop facilities for the design, illustration, modelling, and  \nscenario development to generate plans for prototyping processes and applications.\nSOTON is a world leader in MFC science and engineering and provides a high-end 3D printing  \nsuite  with  multi-material  fabrication  and  biomaterial  extrusion;  5-axis  CNC  and  heavy  \nmachining; ESEM, SIFT, GC-MS. \nUWE’s Envirotron at Frenchay Campus uses LED lighting that minimises environmental  \nimpact  and  affords  exquisite  control  of  light,  enabling  researchers  to  simulate  and  \nexperiment with a wide range of independently fully climate-controllable compartments.  \nCSIC is a State Agency for scientific research and technological development. It’s institute  \nCenter for Biological Research (CIB) offers scientific facilities for: Cell Culture; Bioinformatics  \nand Biostatistics; Genetics and Molecular Analysis; Confocal Laser and Multidimensional  \nMicroscopy;  DNA  Sequencing  Service;  Electron  Microscopy;  Flow  Cytometry;  Gas  \nChromatography;  Glasshouse;  IBISBA-Industrial  Biotechnology;  Macromolecular  \nCrystallography; Molecular Interactions; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; Protein Chemistry;  \nProteomics and Genomics; and Spectroscopy.\nSONY is a world leading electronics company. Sony CSL Paris was founded in 1996 and it is a  \nsmall but booming research cell, using tools from complexity science, data science and  \nartificial  intelligence  to  investigate  fundamental  questions  in  areas  as  diverse  as:  \nunderstanding and creating music, language and communication systems, sustainability,  \ninnovation dynamics and creativity ( https://csl.sony.fr). \nBFC has  over  10-years’  experience  in  assessing  new  and  emerging  bio  and  converging  \ntechnologies,  bridging  science,  society,  artists,  and  policy  makers.  They  provide  a  fully  \nequipped  film  and  video  production  suite,  multi-disciplinary  workshop  (wood  and  other  \nbiomaterials,  metal,  resin,  electronics)  for  rapid  prototyping  and  preparing  interactive  \nworkshops and museum exhibitions.\n9\nMi-Hy\n Deliverable 6.3\nExecutive Summary  \nThis document, namely deliverable D6.3 – Data Management Plan (DMP), outlines the data  \nmanagement  plan  and  protection  approaches  employed  within  the  Mi-Hy  project.  \nSpecifically, it gives an overview of the data that will be collected during the project through  \nthe work packages (WPs) and tasks, and clarifies how these will be collected, stored, and  \nused. This DMP is a dynamic document that will be adapted, refined, and updated throughout  \nthe course of the project, as the exact outputs of each WP, and thus the data management  \nrequirements, become clearer. This DMP will be circulated within the project consortium in  \nM5 (March 2024), revisions will be incorporated, and the document will be submitted to the  \nEC in M6 (April 2024).\n10\nMi-Hy\n Deliverable 6.3\n1.Project Work Packages and Deliverables  \nMi-Hy  is  a  new  circular  platform  and  Hydroponic  Bioelectrical  System  (BES)  for urban \nagriculture that biologically integrates Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N) (C and N) and phosphorous  \n(P) metabolism in plants by combining Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) technology  that produces \nelectricity using electrons derived from biochemical reactions,  with hydroponics that involves \ngrowing plants without soil, to optimise and valorise CO2 and N transformation (to animal  \nfeed as the initial produce).  Mi-Hy’s MFC biofilm acts as a prosthetic rhizosphere  for plant \nroots (which utilize symbiotic relationships between fungi and bacteria to obtain nutrients  \nfrom the environment) to optimize nitrogen utilisation (via the synthesis of chlorophyll and  \namino  acids),  averting  the  need  for  chemical  nitrogen  sources  (artificial  fertilizers)  and  \nturning carbon into biomass.  Mi-Hy is a fundamentally circular system, its only inputs are  \natmospheric CO2, light and (household) wastewater stream (see D6.1 for further details).  \n1.1 Project Work Packages\nMi-Hy’s boundaries, goals, deadlines, and project deliverables will be achieved through the  \nintegration  of  wavelength  specific  hydroponics  with  MFCs  and  MECs,  which  requires \nbreakthroughs in four complementary domains .

While standard 2D representations link power outputs to  \n16\nMi-Hy\n Deliverable 6.3\nperformance parameters Mi-Hy seeks to establish the foundations of  \na  living  platform  with  the  possibility  of  gathering  environmental  \nspatial  data  by  deploying  MFC  nodes  &  responses  to  local  \nenvironment  perturbations  from  the  constituent  microbial  \ncommunities.\nD2.1Evaluation  of  a  Prosthetic  \nRhizosphere ReportEvaluation of Prosthetic Rhizosphere will provide an assessment of  \nthe anaerobic sites for N-fixing bacteria so that all species, not just  \nlegumes, could be provided with N derived from atmospheric N,  \nsupplementing N from waste fed to MFCs & enabling control over  \nthe balance of N sources. The resulting interplay of pH & N responses  \n(as  NH4+  &  NO3-  ions  are  interconverted)  provides  information  \nabout nutrient uptake plant characteristics & the nitrifying bacteria,  \nwhich can be linked to system monitoring & manipulation (by redox  \npotentials).

To  reach  this  overarching  objective,  links  have  been  established  between  \ndeliverables for the SOs in the various WPs (see Table 2). In SO1 (WP1) BES Hardware  \nOptimisation and Added Functionality will be achieved by optimising the BES components  \n(MFC/MEC), which are characterised for integration in WP4. In SO2 (WP2): Hydroponics  \nparameters will be characterised, namely i) the specific wavelength for N utilisation; ii) biofilm  \nperformance; iii) and data for the digital model will be collected (specific parameters include  \ntemperature, pH,  lights, temperature, and many aspects of the nutrient solution such as  \nelectrical  conductivity)  (WP4).  In  SO3  (WP3):  Cellular  Characterisation  and  Biofilm  \nOptimisation will be achieved by identifying the specific electroactive microbial components  \nfor MFC (prosthetic rhizosphere); ii) characterising metabolic components for MEC iii) testing  \nthe  microbial  data  parameters  for  WP4  model.  In  SO4  (WP4):  Integration  (Modelling,  \nInformatics, VR) and Final Design will be established through a baseline BES performance  \nmodel  that incorporates i)  electrical/metabolic/genetic data of  microbial components  to  \nintegrate cell performance with digital modelling tasks (+VR); ii) Characterises bioelectricity  \nproduction;  iii)  Characterises  component  assembly;  iv)  enables  the  development  of  \ndescriptors  and  prototypes  that  embody  these  logics;  v)  enables  recommendations  for  \nstaged implementation of Mi-Hy; and vi) final design specification, which is the most time and  \nresource intensive stage in the project. In general terms, the scientific results associated with  \nvarious deliverables will feed into other deliverables, mainly modelling and simulation (e.g.,  \nD3.2 and feed into the design of D1.2 through D1.3 and into the final modelling of D4.4).

All datasets  \nwill be exclusively in digital formats and will be created throughout the project as the result of  \nexperimental studies. These digital datasets will be stored in a variety of formats and will have  \nvolumes ranging from less than 1GB to greater than 50TB. \nTable 6: Specific characteristics of the data/ datasets of the Mi-Hy project, including their anticipated  \ntypes, formats, and volumes.\nDeliverable Dataset Name Data TypeFormat Volume \nD5.1Public_outputs communicationsMP4, MOV, pdf, jpg, TIFF, \nPSD, png, Word, DWG, \nVRML< 50TB\nD4.1Baseline_MFC_performance experimentalXls, odf, png, jpg <1GB\nD3.1Cellular_Components experimentalXls, odf, png, jpg, png, <1GB\nD1.1Mi-Hy_Prototypes aggregatePhysical models, CAD, Xls, \nodf, png, jpg<50TB\nD1.2Mi-Hy Citizen Science \nVersionaggregatePhysical models, CAD, Xls, \nodf, png, jpg<50TB\nD1.3Hardware_Components experimentalPhysical models, CAD, Xls, \nodf, png, jpg<50TB\nD1.4Modelling_Report aggregatePhysical models, CAD, Xls, \nodf, png, jpg<50TB\nD4.2BEC_Light_Models experimentalXls, odf, png, jpg, png, <1GB\nD4.3Bioelectrical_Network experimentalXls, odf, png, jpg, png, <1GB\nD2.1Prosthetic_Rhizosphere \nEvaluationexperimentalXls, odf, png, jpg, png, <1GB\nD3.2Symbiotic_Components experimentalXls, odf, png, jpg, png, <1GB\n2.4External Usefulness of data\nThe data and knowledge produced through this project should provide guidance for  the \nincorporation of microbial technologies into hydroponics to generate more efficient C and N  \nsynthesis. Building on the natural cycles of C and N, Mi-Hy intensifies these processes,  \nmaking  them  accessible  to  further  technological  intervention  while  working  within  the  \ncarrying capacity of the site. Providing a productive platform for new forms of biosynthesis it  \nextends  the  frontiers  of  the  contributing  fields  (synthetic  biology,  hydroponics,  \nenvironmental engineering, microbial electro-technologies, sustainable architectural design,  \nICT/informatics,  bio/electrochemistry)  whereby  global  development  takes  place  while  \npotential challenges in one aspect of the platform do not compromise advances in another . \nThe  value  of integrating microbial  sources of energy in  addition  to renewables aims to  \ngenerate an overall more resilient hydroponics system with increasing degrees of autonomy  \nand self-regulation within different territories of the overall system so it is much harder to  \nreach  tipping  points,  and  consequent  system  collapse.  As  both  passive  and  active  \n21\nMi-Hy\n Deliverable 6.3\nhydroponics systems depend on electricity to power the different components such as grow  \nlights, water pumps, aerators, fans, etc., integrating MFCs to power LEDs and add new  \nfunctionality through MES electrobiosynthesis enables a higher level of outputs than growing  \nplants traditionally with additional synthesis of novel biomolecules. To maintain a carefully  \ncontrolled  growing  environment,  system  components  (lights,  temperature,  and  many  \naspects of the nutrient solution such as pH and electrical conductivity) are integrated with  \n‘microbial intelligence,’ a uniquely environmental sensitivity, which is expressed as the total  \nbioelectricity produced at any given moment to engage an AI/Machine Learning set-up that  \nmodels the system, enabling it to be stabilized via automation. MFCs will also be explored as  \na  microbial  ‘buffer’  (or  immune)  system  to  remove  potential  pathogens,  as  waterborne  \ndiseases are considerably higher in hydroponics systems. The system advances its circularity  \nto develop a material/product extension of Mi-Hy through prototyping a new type of “green”  \nbio-brick building material for recycling C and D waste in urban environments.  Due this broad \nrange of potential audiences for the project’s data and results, findings will be communicated  \nvia  different  channels  such  as  scientific  literature,  conferences,  the  project  website,  \nindustry/professional press, social media, and newsletters. Explicitly scientific data, such as \nmaterials and methods, protocols, and coding scripts, will be available online in trusted  \nrepositories as part of related scientific publications, making it possible for other researchers  \nto not only better understand the underlying methodologies used to deliver the project’s  \nfindings, but also, when possible, to replicate the findings themselves.  The Mi-Hy consortium  \nwill make its datasets Open Access and upload them to the Project Website and to Zenodo,  \nthe Open Science platform funded by the EU, the Open Hardware Observatory to assure a  \nunique DOI for each dataset, unless the institution of the primary creator of the relevant  \npublication/data  recommends  a  specific  repository.  After  IP  protection  has  been  \nassessed/secured, useful open access datasets will also be publicly available on the Project  \nWebsite and made available for download. Open Research Data is managed via a detailed  \nData Management Plan (DMP) in compliance with Article 17 to ensure that data collected  \nthroughout the project, and underpinning the publications, can be accessed (and therefore  \nthe  results  reproduced)  and  that  the  data/research  outputs  are  findable,  accessible,  \ninteroperable, and reusable (FAIR). For Open Access scientific publications, we will use public  \nshared spaces e.g., arXiv.org. For green open access Lirias is used. Other project outputs e.g.,  \nvideo,  animations,  public  information  are  hosted  on  the  Mi-Hy  website,  the  Research  \nCatalogue (www.researchcatalogue.net) and YouTube.\n22\nMi-Hy\n Deliverable 6.3\n3.FAIR data\nThe project consortium aims to make all data, aside from any GDPR-sensitive data and data\nobtained within the confines of a confidentiality agreement. Open Research Data is managed  \nvia this detailed Data Management Plan (DMP) and its rolling updates, in compliance with  \nArticle  17  to  ensure  that  data  collected  throughout  the  project,  and  underpinning  the  \npublications,  can  be  accessed  (and  therefore  the  results  reproduced)  and  that  the  \ndata/research outputs are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR )1.\n3.1 Findability\nThe Mi-Hy consortium will make its datasets Open Access and upload them to the Project  \nWebsite and to Zenodo, the Open Science platform funded by the EU, the Open Hardware  \nObservatory, to assure a unique DOI for each dataset, unless the institution of the primary  \ncreator of the relevant publication/data recommends a specific repository. After IP protection  \nhas been assessed/secured, useful open access datasets will also be publicly available on the  \nProject Website and made available for download.\n.\n3.1.1 Persistent Identifiers\nAll data and research outputs will be evaluated by the board before making datasets open.  \nFor Open Access scientific publications, we will use public shared spaces e.g., arXiv.org. For \ngreen  open  access  Lirias  is  used.  Other project  outputs e.g.,  video,  animations,  public  \ninformation  are  hosted  on  the  Mi-Hy  website,  the  Research  Catalogue  \n(www.researchcatalogue.net) and YouTube. The consortium foresees a maximum 6-month  \nperiod during which IP protection will be assessed/secured. The accessibility of research  \noutput also follows the publication strategy of the partners. The Periodic Reports will include  \nan  update  of  the  datasets  that  have  been  produced  during  the  given  period  and  their  \naccessibility status. After the IP concerns have been addressed  (non-GDPR sensitive and  \nunbound by confidentiality agreements) , datasets will  be publicly available, as discussed  \nabove. Datasets that are used in scientific publications or used to train Mi-Hy’s published  \nmachine learning algorithms will be given DOI and made publicly available, being deposited  \nin online trusted repositories such as Zenodo, with programming code deposited in GitHub  \nand/or GitLab. Zenodo automatically assigns a persistent identifier (DOI) to all inputs, and the  \nGitHub and GitLab repositories will be linked within the appropriate Zenodo repositories.  \nKUL’s institutional repository RDR (https://rdr.kuleuven.be) will be used to ensure that all  \ndata has a DOI and metadata can be added so it is findable.  If open access is not possible,  \nreasons for restricted data sharing for datasets will be given .\n1 Mark D. Wilkinson; Michel Dumontier; IJsbrand Jan Aalbersberg; et  al. (15 March 2016). \"The FAIR Guiding Principles for  \nscientific data management and stewardship\" . Scientific Data. 3 (1): 160018. doi:10.1038/SDATA.2016.18\n23\nMi-Hy\n Deliverable 6.3\n3.1.2 Metadata, searchability, and indexing\nData deposited in Zenodo will always be described with  metadata and is compliant with  \nDataCite,  a  leading  global  non-profit  organization  that  provides  persistent  identifiers  \n(specifically DOIs) for research data and other research outputs . The ISA framework will be  \nused  for  metadata  in  combination  with  the  metadata  standard  for  the  field  of  inquiry.  \nSpecifically, the metadata will always include the persistent identifier of the data it is related  \nto, and the metadata of each deposit will be indexed and searchable after publishing in  \nZenodo’s search engine.  The data will be stored in open non-proprietary formats such as  \n(JPEG/PNG/TIFF, PDF, JSON, CSV, RDF). If proprietary formats are used internally, a usable  \ncopy will be available in one of the recommended open formats. As Mi-Hy will link data from  \ndifferent fields into a common modelling  system, the consortium may need to introduce new  \nmetadata. Data sharing and transfer within the consortium either goes through a protected  \nserver  storage  managed  by  the  consortium  (for  non-real-time  data  exchange)  or  over  \nencrypted channels (VPN, SSH tunnel) for real-time data. Finally, all relevant materials will be  \ndirected  to  DataCite  servers  during  DOI  registration  and  indexed  therein.  Zenodo  \nautomatically catalogues the metadata, with relevant statistics reported, such that the data  \nand metadata can be seamlessly harvested through the platform. Additionally, the metadata  \nwill  (whenever  possible)  contain  the  following:  (i)  the  terms  “European  Union  (EU)”,  \n“European Innovation Council (EIC)” and “Carbon Dioxide and Nitrogen Valorisation and  \nManagement Pathfinder Challenges”; (ii) “Microbial Hydroponics” (name of the project); (iii)  \n“Mi-Hy”  (the  project  acronym);  (iv)  “101114746 ”  (the  project/grant  number);  (v)  the  \npublication date in case of a scientific publication or the date it is deposited in the repository;  \n(vi) the PID (i.e., DOI), which is automatically assigned when using Zenodo.\n3.2 Accessibility\n3.2.1 Trusted repositories\nAll data generated and/or collected through the project that can be made publicly available  \n(i.e., non-GDPR sensitive data and unbound to confidentiality agreements) will be deposited  \nonline in a trusted repository. The main repositories that will be used are Zenodo for the  \ngeneral content and GitHub and GitLab for programming code ( e.g., written in R). Data  \nentered in GitHub/GitLab will be linked to Zenodo. All open access data in the repositories will  \nby licensed through CC-BY, CC-0, or an equivalent license. Publications generated using  \nproject  data  will  be  deposited  in  a  trusted  repository  at  the  time  of  publication.  All  \ninformation required for the understanding, reuse, or repurposing of the data will be attached  \nto the data, and all information necessary to repeat, recreate, and validate the results will  \naccompany the publications. In the repository, immediate open access will be provided. Data  \ncontaining  GDPR-sensitive  information  and  data  obtained  through  confidentiality  \nagreements will not be made publicly available,  and when reports or scientific papers are  \nwritten  using  processed,  pseudonymized,  and/or  anonymized  data,  open  access  will  be  \ngranted through a trusted repository. \n24\nMi-Hy\n Deliverable 6.3\n3.2.2 Arrangements with repositories\nDetailed information is provided on Zenodo’s website, and it was therefore ensured that this  \nrepository will meet the needs of the project prior to the formulation of this DMP. Specifically,  \nZenodo allows the deposit of all data formats, and the default limit for total file size per  \ndeposit is 50GB. Although, at this stage of the project, there is some indication that some  \ndatasets may exceed this size (specifically image files), it has been indicated by Zenodo that if  \nmore volume is needed, it can be requested. Zenodo also makes research results citable and,  \nthrough  OpenAIRE,  integrates  them  into  the  existing  reporting  lines  of  the  European  \nCommission, with uploading of the research content free of charge. For programming code,  \nsuch as R  codes and scripts, GitHub/GitLab will be used, which  are trusted repositories  \nspecifically tailored to the collaborative development of these types of documents. These  \nrepositories enable the archiving of hosted repositories within Zenodo, not only making it  \neasier to refer to and find the desired GitHub/GitLab repository, but also creating a persistent  \nidentifier. Additionally, GitHub/GitLab are free-to-use and provide 500MB storage, which  \nshould be more than sufficient for the programming code, scripts, etc. that will be developed  \nwithin this project.\n3.2.3 Identifiers assigned through repositories.\nData deposited into Zenodo will automatically receive a PID ( i.e., DOI), and Zenodo allows  \nDOI versioning, which will allow the referencing across different versions of a document or  \ndata. Research outputs ( i.e., R scripts, programming code,  etc.) and data deposited into  \nGitHub/GitLab will be assigned a PID ( i.e., DOI) through the linking of the GitHub/GitLab  \nrepository to an associated Zenodo repository.\n3.2.4 Open availability of Data\nGDPR-sensitive and data collected within the bounds of a confidentiality agreement, which  \nmay include names, addresses, locations, email addresses, and/or recordings that cannot be  \nmade publicly available are not foreseen, however, if such data (e.g. questionnaires from  \nexhibition surveys) are collected they will not be made publicly available. In the case of both  \nthe GDPR-sensitive and any potential confidentiality-bound data, those raw data will be  \nprocessed into a pseudonymized or anonymized form, and once processed, will be included in  \nreports or publications. The processed data will ensure anonymity and therefore may be  \nmade available via an online trusted repository, as previously described.  \n3.2.5 Data storage and access to Sensitive Data\nData and research outputs will be stored within the institutional servers of the individual  \npartners, and data that is GDPR sensitive or obtained through confidentiality agreements will  \nstay there in a safe, enclosed environment only allowing access to the persons directly  \n25\nMi-Hy\n Deliverable 6.3\ninvolved in that specific part of the deliverable. In the case that a participant gives permission  \nto the researchers to share personal information with other partners or research projects, this  \nwill be documented through the signing of an informed consent document, but without this  \nsigned consent document, sensitive data will not be made publicly available and will not be  \nshared  with  other  project  partners.  Data  that  can  be  shared  openly  among  the  project  \npartners will be placed on the project SharePoint, with access restricted to only those actively  \ninvolved in the project, with access controlled by the project management team based at  \nKUL.\n3.2.6 Availability of metadata\nAll metadata will be openly available in the previously described repositories and will be  \nlicensed through a CC-0 waiver. Zenodo allows the harvesting of data from the repository  \nthrough  its  OAI-PMH  protocol.  Additionally,  data  will  be  exported  in  several  standard  \nformats, such as MARCXML, Dublin Core, and DataCite Metadata Schema.\n3.2.7 Duration\nData or metadata should be deposited in repositories (see above) and made publicly available  \nas soon as possible, provided they are not GDPR sensitive, obtained through confidentiality  \nagreements or subjected to patenting.  All results will be evaluated by the board before  \nmaking datasets open. The consortium foresees a maximum 6-month period during which IP  \nprotection will be assessed/secured. The accessibility of research output also follows the  \npublication strategy of the partners. The Periodic Reports will include an update of the  \ndatasets that have been produced during the given period and their accessibility status. After  \nthe IP concerns have been addressed, datasets will be publicly available, as discussed above.  \nDatasets that are used in scientific publications or used to train Mi-Hy’s published machine  \nlearning  algorithms  will  be  given  DOI  and  made  publicly  available.  KUL’s  institutional  \nrepository RDR will be used to ensure that all data has a DOI and metadata can be added so it  \nis findable. If open access is not possible, reasons for restricted data sharing for datasets will  \nbe given. The (meta) data will be retained as long as possible provided the repository remains  \nactive, this will be far beyond the end of the Mi-Hy project, ensuring these data remain  \navailable to the scientific community for the years to come.\n3.2.8 Additional documentation and software\nWhenever  possible,  free-to-use  software  will  be  used  to  ensure  data  accessibility  and  \nreadability.\nTable 3 presents an overview of the GDPR sensitivity of the datasets, their storage locations,  \npersistent identifiers, and to what extent the datasets will be publicly available. Note that in  \nsome WPs and deliverables, the precise method to be used has yet to be decided, and  \ntherefore the GDPR-sensitivity described may still change.\n26\nMi-Hy\n Deliverable 6.3\nTable 7.

The data will be stored in open non-proprietary formats such as (JPEG/PNG/TIFF,  \nPDF, JSON, CSV, RDF). The DMP will list the recommended open data formats for each of the  \n28\nMi-Hy\n Deliverable 6.3\nresearch fields of the consortium. If proprietary formats are used internally, a usable copy will  \nbe available in one of the recommended open formats. The ISA framework will be used for  \nmetadata in combination with the  metadata standard for the field of inquiry. The list of  \nstandards  will  be  listed  in  the DMP  in  collaboration  with  all  the  partners  and  reviewed \nannually to ensure all published datasets are up to date with the latest developments. As Mi-\nHy will link data from different fields into a common modelling  system, the consortium may  \nneed to introduce new metadata. Data sharing and transfer within the consortium either goes  \nthrough a protected server storage managed by the consortium (for non-real-time data  \nexchange) or over encrypted channels (VPN, SSH tunnel) for real-time data.  Additionally, \nvocabulary will be standardized, whenever possible, with the following formats consistently  \napplied across project datasets: (i) dates will be reported in “yyyy/mm/dd” format; European  \ncountries will be reported either in full according to the UN Geoscheme or abbreviated  \naccording to the official Eurostat abbreviations; bacteria will be reported with full genus and  \nspecies in italic and serotypes in Latin, with any abbreviations to genus clearly described;  \nviruses will be reported using official scientific names, with strain-specific information in  \nbrackets, if necessary.\n3.4 Reusability\nMi-Hy  uses  transparent  research  design,  robust  statistical  analyses,  addresses  negative  \nresults early and shares through preregistration  and preprints, with open access to software,  \nworkflows, tools, etc.\n3.4.1 Additional documentation\nAll datasets, programming scripts,  etc. will always contain a README file and/or a list of  \nabbreviations to ensure clarity.  Mi-Hy will make use of Open Licenses for data sharing and re-\nuse including the Creative Commons licence for images, text, and design files and Open Data  \nCommons for datasets. Software modules will, as much as possible, be made accessible  \nunder Open-Source licenses (LGPLv3…) through code repositories e.g., Github and easy-to-\nuse tools such as JupyterLab (www.jupyter.org). We will assure that the structure of public  \ndatasets is documented (in case they are not stored using standard formats and metadata)  \nand provide Open-Sourced example code to import the data for re-use.\n3.2.4 Public domain\nPartners that have produced data through the project workflow will remain the owners of  \nthat data but will share the raw data, and, if applicable, the post-treated data, and/or overall  \nfindings and conclusions with project management team and, if asked, with other partners.  \nAll  outputs  or  processed  data  produced  through  the  project  workflow  that  are  neither  \nconfidential nor GDPR sensitive will be made publicly available as licensed under CC-BY or an  \nequivalent/comparable license, with metadata licensed under CC-0, as is automatically done  \nwhen using Zenodo.\n29\nMi-Hy\n Deliverable 6.3\n3.4.3 Third party use\nResearch  output  available  through  trusted  repositories  can  be  used  by  other  parties,  if  \ncorrectly  referenced.  During  the  project,  surveys/interviews  will  be  conducted,  and  \nparticipants will have to sign an informed consent document. If participants agree that the  \ncontent of their completed survey/interview can be transferred to other research projects and  \ninstitutions, with or without their contact details, this output can also be used by other third  \nparties upon request.\n3.4.4 Quality assurance process\nThe Mi-Hy consortium is comprised of researchers from internationally recognized institutes  \nwith their own institution-specific research standards. Each Project Lead is responsible for  \ndata management and quality assurance within their own organisation using their own data  \nmanagement systems, where costs are included in their respective budgets.  The project \npartners will organise shared data according to specifications identified in the DMP by M6.  \nSONY, in collaboration with coordinator KUL, will assure the availability and quality of the  \npublic datasets of the consortium as part of the digital modelling tasks. Additionally, research  \noutputs, including non-sensitive data, generated through the project workflow will be shared  \nacross institutions and partners, with this sharing serving as an implicit peer review system  \nprior to explicit peer review at the time of publication or wider distribution. The protocols,  \nprocedures, and methodologies used to collect data are discussed in regularly scheduled  \ncross-deliverable and cross-WP meetings to get input, feedback, and assure the applicability,  \nrelevance  and  quality  of  the  data  collected.  Finally,  when  deliverables  are  drafted,  the  \ncomplete document is reviewed by at least two other partners in the consortium prior to the  \nsubmission of the deliverable to the EC and/or peer-reviewed journal.\n4.Other Outputs\nDue to the broad range of potential audiences for the project’s data and results, findings will  \nbe communicated through varied channels and networks, such as through peer-reviewed  \nscientific literature, conference abstracts, posters, and presentations, the project website,  \nindustry/professional press, social media, and newsletters.\n30\nMi-Hy\n Deliverable 6.3\n5.Resource Allocation  \n5.1 Costs\nThere are no cost anticipated, at this stage of the project, associated with the use of trusted  \nrepositories to meet FAIR data guidelines. At the deliverable level, the data and information  \nwill be stored on institutional servers at no charge. Each institution stores their research data  \non local secure networks and server, or protected cloud storage systems, with a daily regular  \nfull backup. The actual deposition of project data into the repositories is free up to 50GB per  \nrecord for Zenodo and for up to 500MB per user for GitHub/GitLab, which is considered likely  \nto be enough space for the data generated in the project.\n5.2 Responsibilities\nThe overarching data management within the Mi-Hy project is led  by KUL, the project  \ncoordinator. KUL’s institutional repository RDR will be used to ensure that all data has a DOI  \nand metadata can be added so it is findable.  If open access is not possible, reasons for  \nrestricted data sharing for datasets will be given. At the deliverable level, each consortium  \npartner institution is responsible for the handling and storing of data collected through the  \nproject workflow, meaning partners are responsible for ensuring data confidentiality and  \nstorage, including the provision of back-ups on institutional servers, hard drives, computers,  \netc.\n5.3 Duration\nThe data management team at KUL will ensure preservation of the data deposited at the  \nproject SharePoint for at least 5 years after the end of the project, at which point, archiving  \nresponsibilities  will  rest  upon  the  partners  that  generated  the  data.  Data  and  research  \noutputs deposited into Zenodo will be preserved for at least five years. Research articles  \npublished  in  open  access  journals  should  remain  accessible  indefinitely  through  online  \nlibraries and search platforms.\n31\nMi-Hy\n Deliverable 6.3\n6.Security\nCollected data and research outputs will be stored, with back-ups, on institutional servers,  \nhard  drives,  computers,  etc.,  with  individual  partners  adhering  to  institution-level  \ninformation technology security protocols and policy. Sensitive data will remain with the  \ninstitution  that  collected  that  data,  stored  in  a  pseudonymized  such  that  personally  \nidentifiable data cannot be identified within a single document. Only researchers within the  \nspecific group working on the sensitive data will have access, unless written and documented  \nconsent has been given by the person(s) whose data generated the dataset. Sensitive data  \nwill not be shared or transferred among partners unless the participant gave its informed  \nconsent to do so, and in the absence of this consent, only anonymized data will be shared  \namong partners.\n6.1 Data sharing and transfer within the Mi-Hy Consortium\nData sharing and transfer within the consortium either goes through a protected server  \nstorage managed by the consortium (for non-real-time data exchange) or over encrypted  \nchannels  (VPN,  SSH  tunnel)  for  real-time  data.  Data  sharing  and  transfer  within  the  \nconsortium occurs via secure methods of digital transfer through password protected access  \nby named members of the consortium. Data from microbial intelligence experiments by  \nSOTON is securely transferred to SONY with encrypted protection and incorporated into the  \ndigital  model.  The  digital  model  and  Zoom  communications  networks  that  combined,  \ncomprise the facility of the virtual laboratory, are used concurrently by consortium members  \nbut are not directly connected. This maintains the separation between the digital model and  \nZoom platform. When open access is not possible, reasons for restricted data sharing for  \ndatasets will be given.\n32\nMi-Hy\n Deliverable 6.3\n7.Ethics\nThe beneficiaries of Mi-Hy will respect and uphold the fundamental principle of research  \nintegrity as set out in the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (European Code of  \nConduct for Research Integrity of ALLEA (All European Academies). Specifically, the Mi-Hy  \nconsortium will comply with the following principles: i) reliability in ensuring the quality of  \nresearch reflected in the design, the methodology, the analysis, and the use of resources; ii)  \nhonesty in developing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting, and communicating research in a  \ntransparent, fair, and unbiased way. All beneficiaries will ensure that persons carrying out  \nresearch  tasks  follow  the  good  research  practices  including  ensuring,  where  possible,  \nopenness, reproducibility and traceability and refrain from the research integrity violations  \ndescribed in the Code. \nThe beneficiaries will obtain all approvals or other mandatory documents needed before  \nstarting any action task raising ethical issues, notably from the (national or local) ethics  \ncommittee or other bodies such as data protection authorities. These documents will be kept  \non file and be submitted upon request by the coordinator to the granting authority. If they are  \nnot in English, they will be submitted together with an English summary, which shows that  \nthe  documents  cover  the  action  tasks  in  question  and  includes  the  conclusions  of  the  \ncommittee or authority concerned (if any).\nFor Mi-Hy four specific ethical issues were identified on screening:\nHuman cells / tissues\nNon-EU countries\nEnvironment, health, and safety\nArtificial intelligence\n4.1 Ethical Dimension of the Objectives, Methodology and Likely Impact\nHuman cells/ tissues\nLegally, human tissue includes anything derived from a human being so the use of Urine in  \nMFCs  requires  ethical  consideration.  The  MFC  technology  has  had  approval  from  the  \nNational Health Service Research Ethics Committee (NHS REC, approval no. 12/ YH/0493),  \nfollowing rigorous ethical assessment. After the completion of regular inspection/audit for  \ntwo years, the NHS acknowledged that this work complies fully with NHS ethical regulations  \nand no longer requires NHS oversight (letter sent by NHS REC on August 10, 2015, can be  \nprovided upon request). This work has since been continuously subject to local (previously at  \nUWE,  presently  at  SOTON)  Ethical  scrutiny,  providing  comprehensive  Risk  Assessment  \ndocuments for new research activities. These include new research projects, new trials, new  \npublic exhibition events at different locations, and has consistently followed the Health and  \nSafety regulations of those venues, at which previous projects Urine-tricity, LIAR and ALICE  \nhave been showcased, including Glastonbury Music Festival, UK (2015 onwards) and Beijing  \nToilet Technology Showcase (November 2018). While these rigorous UK protocols have been  \nfollowed,  following  the  Brexit  referendum  these  protocols  will  be  updated  to  ensure  \n33\nMi-Hy\n Deliverable 6.3\ncompliance  with  EU  standards,  policies,  and  practices.  We  aim  to  uphold  regulatory  \ncompliance in always keeping with the appropriate EU regulations and guidelines.  \nNon-EU countries \nStatus: Both UWE and SOTON are in the UK. Following the Brexit referendum, the UK is no  \nlonger obliged to follow regulatory alignment with the EU or uphold EU Law.  This creates the \npossibility of UK divergence from EU regulatory standards . The University of Southampton \n(SOTON) is in the United Kingdom and are Project Leaders for WP1 which contains the  \nintegrative tasks of the projects where BES hardware and microbial elements come together  \nthrough organic scaffoldings, bioelectrical system (BES) hardware (MFC) and digital models  \nto produce the final demonstrator that proves the principle of the project. SOTON will also  \nprovide the MFCs to the whole consortium for the hydroponics cultivation chamber set-ups  \n(CSIC, SONY for experimental study and BF, KUL for public engagement). The University of  \nthe West of England (UWE) is Project Leader for WP2 which contains the hydroponics tasks of  \nthe  projects.  This  will  be  conducted  at  the  Envirotron  greenhouse,  which  features  LED \nlighting that minimises environmental impact and affords exquisite control of light, enabling  \nresearchers to simulate and experiment with a wide range of conditions. Compartments are  \nindependently  fully  climate  controllable.  No  research  activities  are  carried  out  in  these  \norganisations that are prohibited in the EU. All activities will comply with the ethics provisions  \nset  out  in  the  Grant  Agreement,  will  uphold  the  highest  ethical  standards  and  will  be  \napplicable to international, EU and national law.  \nEnvironment Health and Safety\nMi-Hy addresses nitrogen and carbon metabolism through the study of limited waste stream  \nuse and via genetically modified organisms. Consequently, there is a small risk that activities  \nmay adversely affect the environment through: i) the handling of wastestreams with high  \nnitrogen,  phosphorous  and  carbon  loads,  which  on  build  up  in  lakes,  rivers,  \nstreams, and coastal areas, result in serious environmental, economic,  and health effects; and \nii)  the  use  of  synthetic  biology  with  the  risk  of  enhanced  pathogenicity  of  workhorse  \norganisms with the emergence of a new disease, pest or weed with adverse effects on  \nspecies,  communities,  or  ecosystems.  Additionally,  the  health  and  safety  of  all  human  \nparticipants  is  a  priority  in  Mi-Hy  whether  participants  are  subjects,  investigators,  or  \nuninvolved third parties. The Mi-Hy consortium therefore adopts the precautionary principle  \nupholding  legislation  on  pollution  control  and  health  and  security,  working  with  strict  \nlaboratory protocols and practices when using residues from wastestreams and modified  \norganisms.\nArtificial Intelligence\nThe 'artificial intelligence' indicated in this study (WP4, activities) is developed to study  \nthe behaviour of microbes and generate data for the digital twin, which helps integrate  \nthe microbial electronic components by making predictive evaluations of their electronic  \nperformance  and  compatibility  with  other  microbial  electronic  elements.\n34\nMi-Hy\n Deliverable 6.3\nWe have taken all possible precautions for unbiased AI, and in particular we are not using  \nan AI that may be used to classify human behaviour. The data to train the AI will be  \nderived from in vitro microbial experiments described in WP4. Understanding microbial  \nbehaviour for the digital twin through use of an AI *at system level* not only helps  \nunderstand  microbial  behaviour  but  also  to  understand  microbial  intelligence  and  \n(importantly) enact on this with appropriate action. For example, using a network of  \nMFCs  as  early  warning  devices  for  the  detection  of  harmful  substances  into  our  \nenvironment,  and  having  the  hydraulic  control  valves  connected  to  the  \naction-selection/decision module, so that they can be accordingly turned OFF to stop the  \ninflow  of  toxicants.  Equally  we  could  be  utilising  AI  to  respond  to  extreme  pH  or  \ntemperature changes, via feedback loops, and allowing tools in our system to combat the  \nshift to any extreme.\nIntegration  between  data  and  microbes  will  be  enabled  by  different  modes  of  \ninformation (state variables, potentially in combination), new parameters (chemical, bio,  \ncellular), metrics, optimised energy consumption, and information processing across a  \nrange of timescales, enable enough system control to direct decision-making and for  \nmonitoring the performance of organic electronics. The impact of these activities is for  \nthe compilation and development of the microbial components only and is not foreseen  \nto have any negative impact on humans or the environment. Specifically, the AI proposed  \nin the project is not used to analyse personal data or any data that stem in any way from  \nhuman activities.  It  is also  not used in any  way  to classify personal data or human  \nactivities.  The  data  that  is  generated  comes  from  both  inorganic  sensors  and  from  \nmicrobial systems used as a sensor. The data is combined by the AI to steer high-level  \nfunctions and actuators. As such, it is an advanced, system-level component used in a  \nclassical control theory approach. We therefore believe that the use of the proposed AI  \ndoes not raise ethical concerns related to human rights and values.  \n4.2 Compliance with Ethical Principles and Relevant Legislations\nUse of Urine in MFCs\nFollowing the Brexit referendum, the health and safety protocols developed for SOTON's  \nMFCs will be updated to ensure compliance with all relevant EU regulations. All activities \nwill comply with the ethics provisions set out in the Grant Agreement, and notably adopt  \nthe highest ethical standards as well as the appropriate applicable international, EU and  \nnational  law  (in  particular,  EU  Directive  2004/23  on  standards  for  the  donation,  \nprocurement,  testing,  processing,  preservation,  storage  and  distribution  of  human  \ntissues and cells). In Mi-Hy a limited amount of urine will be used by SOTON, who will  \nkeep track of the origin of the collected urine and obtain the necessary accreditation for  \ncollecting the urine, with free and fully informed consent of the donors. When a limited  \namount of urine is required to inoculate the MFC stack, this is safely taken from a local  \nactivated sludge tank in the secondary treatment stage of wastewater treatment plants.  \nThis means that the urine/wastewater has already been screened for pathogens and is  \ntherefore safe to use, always with caution complying with local HandS governance and  \n35\nMi-Hy\n Deliverable 6.3\nwearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The waste stream is like domestic toilet  \nwaste, so is always treated with appropriate care. The sludge waste can be disposed  \ndown the normal drain or sluice, which connects directly to sewerage, and this should be  \ndone with copious amounts of water so that there is high dilution. Mixing the sludge  \nwaste with a disinfectant like Virkon® for 20 minutes (25g in 5L) and then pouring down  \nthe drain provides an additional level of biosecurity. Other than SOTON, all hydroponic \ncultivation chambers  will use synthetic urine (rather than collected urine/wastewater)  \nwhich contains tryptone (or peptone), yeast extract, NaCl and urea.  \nNon-EU countries\nBoth UWE and SOTON are UK based.  Following Brexit on  1st January 2021, parcels to Europe \nare subject to customs and duty fees . This means that goods shipped between EU countries  \nand the UK mainland must clear customs and require a commercial invoice and other export  \ndocumentation. This will be considered in the planning, preparation, and completion of all  \nMFC deliverables provided by SOTON to SONY, CSIC, KUL, BFC.  Risks associated with  \nregulatory divergence will be addressed by complying with the ethics provisions set out in the  \nGrant Agreement, and notably: i) highest ethical standards; and ii)  applicable international,  \nEU and national law.\nEnvironment Health and Safety\nMi-Hy adopts the highest ethical standards and safety procedures for the handling of all  \nmicroorganisms.  All  hydroponics  experiments  will  be  run  in  parallel  in  identical \nhydroponic cultivation chambers (each with 3 optimum performing species of plants,  \nwith one plant from each variety in a 15x15 cm tray, each with its own MFC stack and  \nMEC) and hosted by each member of the consortium, with expert input from members of  \neach team (CSIC, SOTON, UWE, SONY). MFCs will be made and deployed by SOTON;  \nhydroponics setup is overseen by UWE.  Work is done locally with different foci and results  \nshared via a virtual laboratory platform that allows collaboration and sharing of results.  \nEach cultivation chamber is fed with standardised amounts of carbon (atmospheric CO 2) \nand  N  (“mock”  wastewater  formulated  in  a  recipe  with  an  average  composition  of  \ndifferent wastewater) . Only SOTON will use minimum amounts of collected urine in the  \nMFC  stacks  (see  Use  of  Urine  in  MFCs  p23),  whose  new  labs  at  the  Future  Towns  \nInnovation Hub are containment level 2 because of the work carried out in the group in  \ngeneral. Modified  organisms  are  mainly  used  by  CSIC  and  are  all  BSL1.  The  CSIC  \nethics committee  mandates  the  elimination  of  genetically  modified  \nmicroorganisms after use it to prevent their release into the environment. The  Spanish \nlegislation  that  regulates  this  are  the  Notifications  A/ES/05/I-11  and  A/ES/11/I-02  \n(resolutions of March 6, 2006, and July  1, 2011). UWE will be operating a station at BSL1,  \nbut also has the capability to operate at BSL2 and with GMOs if desirable for the project.  \nWork  at  UWE  will  be  covered  by  the  UK  Advisory  Group  on  Dangerous  Pathogens  \n(UKAGDP) Regulations 2017. At UWE labs BSL1 and BSL2 organisms can be used under  \nUKAGDP under the UWE Health and Safety Standard 21 'Work with Biological Agents'.  \n36\nMi-Hy\n Deliverable 6.3\nFor  GMOs UWE  is under the  UK Health  and  Safety  Executive GMO  (contained  use)  \nRegulations using UWE Health and Safety Standard 22 'Work with GMOs' which prevents  \ntheir release into the environment.  \nArtificial Intelligence\nThe  development  of  the  AI  is  therefore  (according  to  our  reasoning  above)  carried  out  \naccording  to  the  EU's  \"Ethics  Guidelines  for  Trustworthy  AI\"  2019  in  that  it  has  three  \ncomponents, which will be met throughout the system's entire life cycle: (1) it is lawful,  \ncomplying with all applicable laws and regulations (2) it is ethical, where ethical principles and  \nvalues are adhered to and (3) it will be robust, both from a technical and social perspective.\nThe Mi-Hy consortium will ensure that the development, deployment and use of AI systems  \nmeets the seven key requirements for Trustworthy AI: (1) human agency and oversight, (2)  \ntechnical  robustness  and  safety,  (3)  privacy  and  data  governance,  (4)  transparency,  (5)  \ndiversity, non-discrimination and fairness, (6) environmental and societal well-being and (7)  \naccountability. The Mi-Fi consortium will consider technical and non-technical methods to  \nensure the implementation of those requirements.\n37"

Specifically, it gives an overview of the data that will be collected during the project through the work packages (WPs) and tasks, and clarifies how these will be collected, stored, and used. This DMP is a dynamic document that will be adapted, refined, and updated throughout the course of the project, as the exact outputs of each WP, and thus the data management requirements, become clearer. This DMP will be circulated within the project consortium in M5 (March 2024), revisions will be incorporated, and the document will be submitted to the EC in M6 (April 2024). 10 Mi-Hy Deliverable 6.3 1.Project Work Packages and Deliverables Mi-Hy is a new circular platform and Hydroponic Bioelectrical System (BES) for urban agriculture that biologically integrates Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N) (C and N) and phosphorous (P) metabolism in plants by combining Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) technology that produces electricity using electrons derived from biochemical reactions, with hydroponics that involves growing plants without soil, to optimise and valorise CO2 and N transformation (to animal feed as the initial produce). Mi-Hy’s MFC biofilm acts as a prosthetic rhizosphere for plant roots (which utilize symbiotic relationships between fungi and bacteria to obtain nutrients from the environment) to optimize nitrogen utilisation (via the synthesis of chlorophyll and amino acids), averting the need for chemical nitrogen sources (artificial fertilizers) and turning carbon into biomass. Mi-Hy is a fundamentally circular system, its only inputs are atmospheric CO2, light and (household) wastewater stream (see D6.1 for further details). 1.1 Project Work Packages Mi-Hy’s boundaries, goals, deadlines, and project deliverables will be achieved through the integration of wavelength specific hydroponics with MFCs and MECs, which requires breakthroughs in four complementary domains .

To reach this overarching objective, links have been established between deliverables for the SOs in the various WPs (see Table 2). In SO1 (WP1) BES Hardware Optimisation and Added Functionality will be achieved by optimising the BES components (MFC/MEC), which are characterised for integration in WP4. In SO2 (WP2): Hydroponics parameters will be characterised, namely i) the specific wavelength for N utilisation; ii) biofilm performance; iii) and data for the digital model will be collected (specific parameters include temperature, pH, lights, temperature, and many aspects of the nutrient solution such as electrical conductivity) (WP4). In SO3 (WP3): Cellular Characterisation and Biofilm Optimisation will be achieved by identifying the specific electroactive microbial components for MFC (prosthetic rhizosphere); ii) characterising metabolic components for MEC iii) testing the microbial data parameters for WP4 model. In SO4 (WP4): Integration (Modelling, Informatics, VR) and Final Design will be established through a baseline BES performance model that incorporates i) electrical/metabolic/genetic data of microbial components to integrate cell performance with digital modelling tasks (+VR); ii) Characterises bioelectricity production; iii) Characterises component assembly; iv) enables the development of descriptors and prototypes that embody these logics; v) enables recommendations for staged implementation of Mi-Hy; and vi) final design specification, which is the most time and resource intensive stage in the project. In general terms, the scientific results associated with various deliverables will feed into other deliverables, mainly modelling and simulation (e.g., D3.2 and feed into the design of D1.2 through D1.3 and into the final modelling of D4.4).

Building on the natural cycles of C and N, Mi-Hy intensifies these processes, making them accessible to further technological intervention while working within the carrying capacity of the site. Providing a productive platform for new forms of biosynthesis it extends the frontiers of the contributing fields (synthetic biology, hydroponics, environmental engineering, microbial electro-technologies, sustainable architectural design, ICT/informatics, bio/electrochemistry) whereby global development takes place while potential challenges in one aspect of the platform do not compromise advances in another . The value of integrating microbial sources of energy in addition to renewables aims to generate an overall more resilient hydroponics system with increasing degrees of autonomy and self-regulation within different territories of the overall system so it is much harder to reach tipping points, and consequent system collapse. As both passive and active 21 Mi-Hy Deliverable 6.3 hydroponics systems depend on electricity to power the different components such as grow lights, water pumps, aerators, fans, etc., integrating MFCs to power LEDs and add new functionality through MES electrobiosynthesis enables a higher level of outputs than growing plants traditionally with additional synthesis of novel biomolecules. To maintain a carefully controlled growing environment, system components (lights, temperature, and many aspects of the nutrient solution such as pH and electrical conductivity) are integrated with ‘microbial intelligence,’ a uniquely environmental sensitivity, which is expressed as the total bioelectricity produced at any given moment to engage an AI/Machine Learning set-up that models the system, enabling it to be stabilized via automation. MFCs will also be explored as a microbial ‘buffer’ (or immune) system to remove potential pathogens, as waterborne diseases are considerably higher in hydroponics systems. The system advances its circularity to develop a material/product extension of Mi-Hy through prototyping a new type of “green” bio-brick building material for recycling C and D waste in urban environments. Due this broad range of potential audiences for the project’s data and results, findings will be communicated via different channels such as scientific literature, conferences, the project website, industry/professional press, social media, and newsletters. Explicitly scientific data, such as materials and methods, protocols, and coding scripts, will be available online in trusted repositories as part of related scientific publications, making it possible for other researchers to not only better understand the underlying methodologies used to deliver the project’s findings, but also, when possible, to replicate the findings themselves. The Mi-Hy consortium will make its datasets Open Access and upload them to the Project Website and to Zenodo, the Open Science platform funded by the EU, the Open Hardware Observatory to assure a unique DOI for each dataset, unless the institution of the primary creator of the relevant publication/data recommends a specific repository. After IP protection has been assessed/secured, useful open access datasets will also be publicly available on the Project Website and made available for download. Open Research Data is managed via a detailed Data Management Plan (DMP) in compliance with Article 17 to ensure that data collected throughout the project, and underpinning the publications, can be accessed (and therefore the results reproduced) and that the data/research outputs are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). For Open Access scientific publications, we will use public shared spaces e.g., arXiv.org. For green open access Lirias is used. Other project outputs e.g., video, animations, public information are hosted on the Mi-Hy website, the Research Catalogue (www.researchcatalogue.net) and YouTube. 22 Mi-Hy Deliverable 6.3 3.FAIR data The project consortium aims to make all data, aside from any GDPR-sensitive data and data obtained within the confines of a confidentiality agreement. Open Research Data is managed via this detailed Data Management Plan (DMP) and its rolling updates, in compliance with Article 17 to ensure that data collected throughout the project, and underpinning the publications, can be accessed (and therefore the results reproduced) and that the data/research outputs are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR )1. 3.1 Findability The Mi-Hy consortium will make its datasets Open Access and upload them to the Project Website and to Zenodo, the Open Science platform funded by the EU, the Open Hardware Observatory, to assure a unique DOI for each dataset, unless the institution of the primary creator of the relevant publication/data recommends a specific repository. After IP protection has been assessed/secured, useful open access datasets will also be publicly available on the Project Website and made available for download. . 3.1.1 Persistent Identifiers All data and research outputs will be evaluated by the board before making datasets open. For Open Access scientific publications, we will use public shared spaces e.g., arXiv.org. For green open access Lirias is used. Other project outputs e.g., video, animations, public information are hosted on the Mi-Hy website, the Research Catalogue (www.researchcatalogue.net) and YouTube. The consortium foresees a maximum 6-month period during which IP protection will be assessed/secured. The accessibility of research output also follows the publication strategy of the partners. The Periodic Reports will include an update of the datasets that have been produced during the given period and their accessibility status. After the IP concerns have been addressed (non-GDPR sensitive and unbound by confidentiality agreements) , datasets will be publicly available, as discussed above. Datasets that are used in scientific publications or used to train Mi-Hy’s published machine learning algorithms will be given DOI and made publicly available, being deposited in online trusted repositories such as Zenodo, with programming code deposited in GitHub and/or GitLab. Zenodo automatically assigns a persistent identifier (DOI) to all inputs, and the GitHub and GitLab repositories will be linked within the appropriate Zenodo repositories. KUL’s institutional repository RDR (https://rdr.kuleuven.be) will be used to ensure that all data has a DOI and metadata can be added so it is findable. If open access is not possible, reasons for restricted data sharing for datasets will be given . 1 Mark D. Wilkinson; Michel Dumontier; IJsbrand Jan Aalbersberg; et al. (15 March 2016). \"The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship\" . Scientific Data. 3 (1): 160018. doi:10.1038/SDATA.2016.18 23 Mi-Hy Deliverable 6.3 3.1.2 Metadata, searchability, and indexing Data deposited in Zenodo will always be described with metadata and is compliant with DataCite, a leading global non-profit organization that provides persistent identifiers (specifically DOIs) for research data and other research outputs . The ISA framework will be used for metadata in combination with the metadata standard for the field of inquiry. Specifically, the metadata will always include the persistent identifier of the data it is related to, and the metadata of each deposit will be indexed and searchable after publishing in Zenodo’s search engine. The data will be stored in open non-proprietary formats such as (JPEG/PNG/TIFF, PDF, JSON, CSV, RDF). If proprietary formats are used internally, a usable copy will be available in one of the recommended open formats. As Mi-Hy will link data from different fields into a common modelling system, the consortium may need to introduce new metadata. Data sharing and transfer within the consortium either goes through a protected server storage managed by the consortium (for non-real-time data exchange) or over encrypted channels (VPN, SSH tunnel) for real-time data. Finally, all relevant materials will be directed to DataCite servers during DOI registration and indexed therein. Zenodo automatically catalogues the metadata, with relevant statistics reported, such that the data and metadata can be seamlessly harvested through the platform. Additionally, the metadata will (whenever possible) contain the following: (i) the terms “European Union (EU)”, “European Innovation Council (EIC)” and “Carbon Dioxide and Nitrogen Valorisation and Management Pathfinder Challenges”; (ii) “Microbial Hydroponics” (name of the project); (iii) “Mi-Hy” (the project acronym); (iv) “101114746 ” (the project/grant number); (v) the publication date in case of a scientific publication or the date it is deposited in the repository; (vi) the PID (i.e., DOI), which is automatically assigned when using Zenodo. 3.2 Accessibility 3.2.1 Trusted repositories All data generated and/or collected through the project that can be made publicly available (i.e., non-GDPR sensitive data and unbound to confidentiality agreements) will be deposited online in a trusted repository. The main repositories that will be used are Zenodo for the general content and GitHub and GitLab for programming code ( e.g., written in R). Data entered in GitHub/GitLab will be linked to Zenodo. All open access data in the repositories will by licensed through CC-BY, CC-0, or an equivalent license. Publications generated using project data will be deposited in a trusted repository at the time of publication. All information required for the understanding, reuse, or repurposing of the data will be attached to the data, and all information necessary to repeat, recreate, and validate the results will accompany the publications. In the repository, immediate open access will be provided. Data containing GDPR-sensitive information and data obtained through confidentiality agreements will not be made publicly available, and when reports or scientific papers are written using processed, pseudonymized, and/or anonymized data, open access will be granted through a trusted repository. 24 Mi-Hy Deliverable 6.3 3.2.2 Arrangements with repositories Detailed information is provided on Zenodo’s website, and it was therefore ensured that this repository will meet the needs of the project prior to the formulation of this DMP. Specifically, Zenodo allows the deposit of all data formats, and the default limit for total file size per deposit is 50GB. Although, at this stage of the project, there is some indication that some datasets may exceed this size (specifically image files), it has been indicated by Zenodo that if more volume is needed, it can be requested. Zenodo also makes research results citable and, through OpenAIRE, integrates them into the existing reporting lines of the European Commission, with uploading of the research content free of charge. For programming code, such as R codes and scripts, GitHub/GitLab will be used, which are trusted repositories specifically tailored to the collaborative development of these types of documents. These repositories enable the archiving of hosted repositories within Zenodo, not only making it easier to refer to and find the desired GitHub/GitLab repository, but also creating a persistent identifier. Additionally, GitHub/GitLab are free-to-use and provide 500MB storage, which should be more than sufficient for the programming code, scripts, etc. that will be developed within this project. 3.2.3 Identifiers assigned through repositories. Data deposited into Zenodo will automatically receive a PID ( i.e., DOI), and Zenodo allows DOI versioning, which will allow the referencing across different versions of a document or data. Research outputs ( i.e., R scripts, programming code, etc.) and data deposited into GitHub/GitLab will be assigned a PID ( i.e., DOI) through the linking of the GitHub/GitLab repository to an associated Zenodo repository. 3.2.4 Open availability of Data GDPR-sensitive and data collected within the bounds of a confidentiality agreement, which may include names, addresses, locations, email addresses, and/or recordings that cannot be made publicly available are not foreseen, however, if such data (e.g. questionnaires from exhibition surveys) are collected they will not be made publicly available. In the case of both the GDPR-sensitive and any potential confidentiality-bound data, those raw data will be processed into a pseudonymized or anonymized form, and once processed, will be included in reports or publications. The processed data will ensure anonymity and therefore may be made available via an online trusted repository, as previously described. 3.2.5 Data storage and access to Sensitive Data Data and research outputs will be stored within the institutional servers of the individual partners, and data that is GDPR sensitive or obtained through confidentiality agreements will stay there in a safe, enclosed environment only allowing access to the persons directly 25 Mi-Hy Deliverable 6.3 involved in that specific part of the deliverable. In the case that a participant gives permission to the researchers to share personal information with other partners or research projects, this will be documented through the signing of an informed consent document, but without this signed consent document, sensitive data will not be made publicly available and will not be shared with other project partners. Data that can be shared openly among the project partners will be placed on the project SharePoint, with access restricted to only those actively involved in the project, with access controlled by the project management team based at KUL. 3.2.6 Availability of metadata All metadata will be openly available in the previously described repositories and will be licensed through a CC-0 waiver. Zenodo allows the harvesting of data from the repository through its OAI-PMH protocol. Additionally, data will be exported in several standard formats, such as MARCXML, Dublin Core, and DataCite Metadata Schema. 3.2.7 Duration Data or metadata should be deposited in repositories (see above) and made publicly available as soon as possible, provided they are not GDPR sensitive, obtained through confidentiality agreements or subjected to patenting. All results will be evaluated by the board before making datasets open. The consortium foresees a maximum 6-month period during which IP protection will be assessed/secured. The accessibility of research output also follows the publication strategy of the partners. The Periodic Reports will include an update of the datasets that have been produced during the given period and their accessibility status. After the IP concerns have been addressed, datasets will be publicly available, as discussed above. Datasets that are used in scientific publications or used to train Mi-Hy’s published machine learning algorithms will be given DOI and made publicly available. KUL’s institutional repository RDR will be used to ensure that all data has a DOI and metadata can be added so it is findable. If open access is not possible, reasons for restricted data sharing for datasets will be given. The (meta) data will be retained as long as possible provided the repository remains active, this will be far beyond the end of the Mi-Hy project, ensuring these data remain available to the scientific community for the years to come. 3.2.8 Additional documentation and software Whenever possible, free-to-use software will be used to ensure data accessibility and readability. Table 3 presents an overview of the GDPR sensitivity of the datasets, their storage locations, persistent identifiers, and to what extent the datasets will be publicly available. Note that in some WPs and deliverables, the precise method to be used has yet to be decided, and therefore the GDPR-sensitivity described may still change. 26 Mi-Hy Deliverable 6.3 Table 7.

Similarly, for statistical analyses, programming scripts, etc., free-to-use software, such as R, will be used. The data will be stored in open non-proprietary formats such as (JPEG/PNG/TIFF, PDF, JSON, CSV, RDF). The DMP will list the recommended open data formats for each of the 28 Mi-Hy Deliverable 6.3 research fields of the consortium. If proprietary formats are used internally, a usable copy will be available in one of the recommended open formats. The ISA framework will be used for metadata in combination with the metadata standard for the field of inquiry. The list of standards will be listed in the DMP in collaboration with all the partners and reviewed annually to ensure all published datasets are up to date with the latest developments. As Mi- Hy will link data from different fields into a common modelling system, the consortium may need to introduce new metadata. Data sharing and transfer within the consortium either goes through a protected server storage managed by the consortium (for non-real-time data exchange) or over encrypted channels (VPN, SSH tunnel) for real-time data. Additionally, vocabulary will be standardized, whenever possible, with the following formats consistently applied across project datasets: (i) dates will be reported in “yyyy/mm/dd” format; European countries will be reported either in full according to the UN Geoscheme or abbreviated according to the official Eurostat abbreviations; bacteria will be reported with full genus and species in italic and serotypes in Latin, with any abbreviations to genus clearly described; viruses will be reported using official scientific names, with strain-specific information in brackets, if necessary. 3.4 Reusability Mi-Hy uses transparent research design, robust statistical analyses, addresses negative results early and shares through preregistration and preprints, with open access to software, workflows, tools, etc. 3.4.1 Additional documentation All datasets, programming scripts, etc. will always contain a README file and/or a list of abbreviations to ensure clarity. Mi-Hy will make use of Open Licenses for data sharing and re- use including the Creative Commons licence for images, text, and design files and Open Data Commons for datasets. Software modules will, as much as possible, be made accessible under Open-Source licenses (LGPLv3…) through code repositories e.g., Github and easy-to- use tools such as JupyterLab (www.jupyter.org). We will assure that the structure of public datasets is documented (in case they are not stored using standard formats and metadata) and provide Open-Sourced example code to import the data for re-use. 3.2.4 Public domain Partners that have produced data through the project workflow will remain the owners of that data but will share the raw data, and, if applicable, the post-treated data, and/or overall findings and conclusions with project management team and, if asked, with other partners. All outputs or processed data produced through the project workflow that are neither confidential nor GDPR sensitive will be made publicly available as licensed under CC-BY or an equivalent/comparable license, with metadata licensed under CC-0, as is automatically done when using Zenodo. 29 Mi-Hy Deliverable 6.3 3.4.3 Third party use Research output available through trusted repositories can be used by other parties, if correctly referenced. During the project, surveys/interviews will be conducted, and participants will have to sign an informed consent document. If participants agree that the content of their completed survey/interview can be transferred to other research projects and institutions, with or without their contact details, this output can also be used by other third parties upon request. 3.4.4 Quality assurance process The Mi-Hy consortium is comprised of researchers from internationally recognized institutes with their own institution-specific research standards. Each Project Lead is responsible for data management and quality assurance within their own organisation using their own data management systems, where costs are included in their respective budgets. The project partners will organise shared data according to specifications identified in the DMP by M6. SONY, in collaboration with coordinator KUL, will assure the availability and quality of the public datasets of the consortium as part of the digital modelling tasks. Additionally, research outputs, including non-sensitive data, generated through the project workflow will be shared across institutions and partners, with this sharing serving as an implicit peer review system prior to explicit peer review at the time of publication or wider distribution. The protocols, procedures, and methodologies used to collect data are discussed in regularly scheduled cross-deliverable and cross-WP meetings to get input, feedback, and assure the applicability, relevance and quality of the data collected. Finally, when deliverables are drafted, the complete document is reviewed by at least two other partners in the consortium prior to the submission of the deliverable to the EC and/or peer-reviewed journal. 4.Other Outputs Due to the broad range of potential audiences for the project’s data and results, findings will be communicated through varied channels and networks, such as through peer-reviewed scientific literature, conference abstracts, posters, and presentations, the project website, industry/professional press, social media, and newsletters. 30 Mi-Hy Deliverable 6.3 5.Resource Allocation 5.1 Costs There are no cost anticipated, at this stage of the project, associated with the use of trusted repositories to meet FAIR data guidelines. At the deliverable level, the data and information will be stored on institutional servers at no charge. Each institution stores their research data on local secure networks and server, or protected cloud storage systems, with a daily regular full backup. The actual deposition of project data into the repositories is free up to 50GB per record for Zenodo and for up to 500MB per user for GitHub/GitLab, which is considered likely to be enough space for the data generated in the project. 5.2 Responsibilities The overarching data management within the Mi-Hy project is led by KUL, the project coordinator. KUL’s institutional repository RDR will be used to ensure that all data has a DOI and metadata can be added so it is findable. If open access is not possible, reasons for restricted data sharing for datasets will be given. At the deliverable level, each consortium partner institution is responsible for the handling and storing of data collected through the project workflow, meaning partners are responsible for ensuring data confidentiality and storage, including the provision of back-ups on institutional servers, hard drives, computers, etc. 5.3 Duration The data management team at KUL will ensure preservation of the data deposited at the project SharePoint for at least 5 years after the end of the project, at which point, archiving responsibilities will rest upon the partners that generated the data. Data and research outputs deposited into Zenodo will be preserved for at least five years. Research articles published in open access journals should remain accessible indefinitely through online libraries and search platforms. 31 Mi-Hy Deliverable 6.3 6.Security Collected data and research outputs will be stored, with back-ups, on institutional servers, hard drives, computers, etc., with individual partners adhering to institution-level information technology security protocols and policy. Sensitive data will remain with the institution that collected that data, stored in a pseudonymized such that personally identifiable data cannot be identified within a single document. Only researchers within the specific group working on the sensitive data will have access, unless written and documented consent has been given by the person(s) whose data generated the dataset. Sensitive data will not be shared or transferred among partners unless the participant gave its informed consent to do so, and in the absence of this consent, only anonymized data will be shared among partners. 6.1 Data sharing and transfer within the Mi-Hy Consortium Data sharing and transfer within the consortium either goes through a protected server storage managed by the consortium (for non-real-time data exchange) or over encrypted channels (VPN, SSH tunnel) for real-time data. Data sharing and transfer within the consortium occurs via secure methods of digital transfer through password protected access by named members of the consortium. Data from microbial intelligence experiments by SOTON is securely transferred to SONY with encrypted protection and incorporated into the digital model. The digital model and Zoom communications networks that combined, comprise the facility of the virtual laboratory, are used concurrently by consortium members but are not directly connected. This maintains the separation between the digital model and Zoom platform. When open access is not possible, reasons for restricted data sharing for datasets will be given. 32 Mi-Hy Deliverable 6.3 7.Ethics The beneficiaries of Mi-Hy will respect and uphold the fundamental principle of research integrity as set out in the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity of ALLEA (All European Academies). Specifically, the Mi-Hy consortium will comply with the following principles: i) reliability in ensuring the quality of research reflected in the design, the methodology, the analysis, and the use of resources; ii) honesty in developing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting, and communicating research in a transparent, fair, and unbiased way. All beneficiaries will ensure that persons carrying out research tasks follow the good research practices including ensuring, where possible, openness, reproducibility and traceability and refrain from the research integrity violations described in the Code. The beneficiaries will obtain all approvals or other mandatory documents needed before starting any action task raising ethical issues, notably from the (national or local) ethics committee or other bodies such as data protection authorities. These documents will be kept on file and be submitted upon request by the coordinator to the granting authority. If they are not in English, they will be submitted together with an English summary, which shows that the documents cover the action tasks in question and includes the conclusions of the committee or authority concerned (if any). For Mi-Hy four specific ethical issues were identified on screening: Human cells / tissues Non-EU countries Environment, health, and safety Artificial intelligence 4.1 Ethical Dimension of the Objectives, Methodology and Likely Impact Human cells/ tissues Legally, human tissue includes anything derived from a human being so the use of Urine in MFCs requires ethical consideration. The MFC technology has had approval from the National Health Service Research Ethics Committee (NHS REC, approval no. 12/ YH/0493), following rigorous ethical assessment. After the completion of regular inspection/audit for two years, the NHS acknowledged that this work complies fully with NHS ethical regulations and no longer requires NHS oversight (letter sent by NHS REC on August 10, 2015, can be provided upon request). This work has since been continuously subject to local (previously at UWE, presently at SOTON) Ethical scrutiny, providing comprehensive Risk Assessment documents for new research activities. These include new research projects, new trials, new public exhibition events at different locations, and has consistently followed the Health and Safety regulations of those venues, at which previous projects Urine-tricity, LIAR and ALICE have been showcased, including Glastonbury Music Festival, UK (2015 onwards) and Beijing Toilet Technology Showcase (November 2018). While these rigorous UK protocols have been followed, following the Brexit referendum these protocols will be updated to ensure 33 Mi-Hy Deliverable 6.3 compliance with EU standards, policies, and practices. We aim to uphold regulatory compliance in always keeping with the appropriate EU regulations and guidelines. Non-EU countries Status: Both UWE and SOTON are in the UK. Following the Brexit referendum, the UK is no longer obliged to follow regulatory alignment with the EU or uphold EU Law. This creates the possibility of UK divergence from EU regulatory standards . The University of Southampton (SOTON) is in the United Kingdom and are Project Leaders for WP1 which contains the integrative tasks of the projects where BES hardware and microbial elements come together through organic scaffoldings, bioelectrical system (BES) hardware (MFC) and digital models to produce the final demonstrator that proves the principle of the project. SOTON will also provide the MFCs to the whole consortium for the hydroponics cultivation chamber set-ups (CSIC, SONY for experimental study and BF, KUL for public engagement). The University of the West of England (UWE) is Project Leader for WP2 which contains the hydroponics tasks of the projects. This will be conducted at the Envirotron greenhouse, which features LED lighting that minimises environmental impact and affords exquisite control of light, enabling researchers to simulate and experiment with a wide range of conditions. Compartments are independently fully climate controllable. No research activities are carried out in these organisations that are prohibited in the EU. All activities will comply with the ethics provisions set out in the Grant Agreement, will uphold the highest ethical standards and will be applicable to international, EU and national law. Environment Health and Safety Mi-Hy addresses nitrogen and carbon metabolism through the study of limited waste stream use and via genetically modified organisms. Consequently, there is a small risk that activities may adversely affect the environment through: i) the handling of wastestreams with high nitrogen, phosphorous and carbon loads, which on build up in lakes, rivers, streams, and coastal areas, result in serious environmental, economic, and health effects; and ii) the use of synthetic biology with the risk of enhanced pathogenicity of workhorse organisms with the emergence of a new disease, pest or weed with adverse effects on species, communities, or ecosystems. Additionally, the health and safety of all human participants is a priority in Mi-Hy whether participants are subjects, investigators, or uninvolved third parties. The Mi-Hy consortium therefore adopts the precautionary principle upholding legislation on pollution control and health and security, working with strict laboratory protocols and practices when using residues from wastestreams and modified organisms. Artificial Intelligence The 'artificial intelligence' indicated in this study (WP4, activities) is developed to study the behaviour of microbes and generate data for the digital twin, which helps integrate the microbial electronic components by making predictive evaluations of their electronic performance and compatibility with other microbial electronic elements. 34 Mi-Hy Deliverable 6.3 We have taken all possible precautions for unbiased AI, and in particular we are not using an AI that may be used to classify human behaviour. The data to train the AI will be derived from in vitro microbial experiments described in WP4. Understanding microbial behaviour for the digital twin through use of an AI *at system level* not only helps understand microbial behaviour but also to understand microbial intelligence and (importantly) enact on this with appropriate action. For example, using a network of MFCs as early warning devices for the detection of harmful substances into our environment, and having the hydraulic control valves connected to the action-selection/decision module, so that they can be accordingly turned OFF to stop the inflow of toxicants. Equally we could be utilising AI to respond to extreme pH or temperature changes, via feedback loops, and allowing tools in our system to combat the shift to any extreme. Integration between data and microbes will be enabled by different modes of information (state variables, potentially in combination), new parameters (chemical, bio, cellular), metrics, optimised energy consumption, and information processing across a range of timescales, enable enough system control to direct decision-making and for monitoring the performance of organic electronics. The impact of these activities is for the compilation and development of the microbial components only and is not foreseen to have any negative impact on humans or the environment. Specifically, the AI proposed in the project is not used to analyse personal data or any data that stem in any way from human activities. It is also not used in any way to classify personal data or human activities. The data that is generated comes from both inorganic sensors and from microbial systems used as a sensor. The data is combined by the AI to steer high-level functions and actuators. As such, it is an advanced, system-level component used in a classical control theory approach. We therefore believe that the use of the proposed AI does not raise ethical concerns related to human rights and values. 4.2 Compliance with Ethical Principles and Relevant Legislations Use of Urine in MFCs Following the Brexit referendum, the health and safety protocols developed for SOTON's MFCs will be updated to ensure compliance with all relevant EU regulations. All activities will comply with the ethics provisions set out in the Grant Agreement, and notably adopt the highest ethical standards as well as the appropriate applicable international, EU and national law (in particular, EU Directive 2004/23 on standards for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells). In Mi-Hy a limited amount of urine will be used by SOTON, who will keep track of the origin of the collected urine and obtain the necessary accreditation for collecting the urine, with free and fully informed consent of the donors. When a limited amount of urine is required to inoculate the MFC stack, this is safely taken from a local activated sludge tank in the secondary treatment stage of wastewater treatment plants. This means that the urine/wastewater has already been screened for pathogens and is therefore safe to use, always with caution complying with local HandS governance and 35 Mi-Hy Deliverable 6.3 wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The waste stream is like domestic toilet waste, so is always treated with appropriate care. The sludge waste can be disposed down the normal drain or sluice, which connects directly to sewerage, and this should be done with copious amounts of water so that there is high dilution. Mixing the sludge waste with a disinfectant like Virkon® for 20 minutes (25g in 5L) and then pouring down the drain provides an additional level of biosecurity. Other than SOTON, all hydroponic cultivation chambers will use synthetic urine (rather than collected urine/wastewater) which contains tryptone (or peptone), yeast extract, NaCl and urea. Non-EU countries Both UWE and SOTON are UK based. Following Brexit on 1st January 2021, parcels to Europe are subject to customs and duty fees . This means that goods shipped between EU countries and the UK mainland must clear customs and require a commercial invoice and other export documentation. This will be considered in the planning, preparation, and completion of all MFC deliverables provided by SOTON to SONY, CSIC, KUL, BFC. Risks associated with regulatory divergence will be addressed by complying with the ethics provisions set out in the Grant Agreement, and notably: i) highest ethical standards; and ii) applicable international, EU and national law. Environment Health and Safety Mi-Hy adopts the highest ethical standards and safety procedures for the handling of all microorganisms. All hydroponics experiments will be run in parallel in identical hydroponic cultivation chambers (each with 3 optimum performing species of plants, with one plant from each variety in a 15x15 cm tray, each with its own MFC stack and MEC) and hosted by each member of the consortium, with expert input from members of each team (CSIC, SOTON, UWE, SONY). MFCs will be made and deployed by SOTON; hydroponics setup is overseen by UWE. Work is done locally with different foci and results shared via a virtual laboratory platform that allows collaboration and sharing of results. Each cultivation chamber is fed with standardised amounts of carbon (atmospheric CO 2) and N (“mock” wastewater formulated in a recipe with an average composition of different wastewater) . Only SOTON will use minimum amounts of collected urine in the MFC stacks (see Use of Urine in MFCs p23), whose new labs at the Future Towns Innovation Hub are containment level 2 because of the work carried out in the group in general. Modified organisms are mainly used by CSIC and are all BSL1. The CSIC ethics committee mandates the elimination of genetically modified microorganisms after use it to prevent their release into the environment. The Spanish legislation that regulates this are the Notifications A/ES/05/I-11 and A/ES/11/I-02 (resolutions of March 6, 2006, and July 1, 2011). UWE will be operating a station at BSL1, but also has the capability to operate at BSL2 and with GMOs if desirable for the project. Work at UWE will be covered by the UK Advisory Group on Dangerous Pathogens (UKAGDP) Regulations 2017. At UWE labs BSL1 and BSL2 organisms can be used under UKAGDP under the UWE Health and Safety Standard 21 'Work with Biological Agents'. 36 Mi-Hy Deliverable 6.3 For GMOs UWE is under the UK Health and Safety Executive GMO (contained use) Regulations using UWE Health and Safety Standard 22 'Work with GMOs' which prevents their release into the environment. Artificial Intelligence The development of the AI is therefore (according to our reasoning above) carried out according to the EU's \"Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI\" 2019 in that it has three components, which will be met throughout the system's entire life cycle: (1) it is lawful, complying with all applicable laws and regulations (2) it is ethical, where ethical principles and values are adhered to and (3) it will be robust, both from a technical and social perspective. The Mi-Hy consortium will ensure that the development, deployment and use of AI systems meets the seven key requirements for Trustworthy AI: (1) human agency and oversight, (2) technical robustness and safety, (3) privacy and data governance, (4) transparency, (5) diversity, non-discrimination and fairness, (6) environmental and societal well-being and (7) accountability. The Mi-Fi consortium will consider technical and non-technical methods to ensure the implementation of those requirements. 37"
