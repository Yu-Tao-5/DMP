The project has a triple goal. First, we will reinforce knowledge by \nincreasing the  technology  readiness  level  towards  application . Second,  we will form a consortium  \nthat, based  on the obtained  pilot dataset  and living  labs, will submit  a horizon  Europe  project.  Third,  \ntogether  with external  partners  (Bodemkundige  Dienst van  Belgi Ã« and Bosgroep  Zuid - Nederland)  \nwe aim to design  and roll out an expert  system  for consultancy  activities . Our first research  question  \nassesses  both chemical  rock product  variables  (dataset  originating  from 4 screening  tests  for product  \nANC),  next the behaviour  of rock dust products on soils is predicted  by a mechanistic  model   that \nuses data from these  screening  tests.  The second  research  question  addresses  planting  pit \napplications  of rock dusts, here a longitudinal  dataset  of tree growth  (height,  diameter)  as a function  \nof rock dust and substratum  is made  with intermittent  measures  of leaves'  nutrient  contents.  The \nthird  research  question  determines  the long-term  effects  via a dataset  that combines  different  \nhistorical  experiments  and the effects  on soil chemistry  (pH, %BS),  tree growth  (tree  ring analyses),  \ntree nutrition  (needle  nutrient  concentrations),  and biodiversity  of the assessed  plots.  The last \nresearch  question  will combine  the previous  lines of knowledge  in a probabilistic  Bayesian  Belief  \nNetwork  to estimate  (un)certainty  of output  variables  in rock dust restoration after  updating certain  \ninput variables  (rock type,  soil type, trees,  time since  application...).  \nInstitution  KU Leuven  \n \n1.

Does your research possibly result in research data with potential for tech  \ntransfer  and valorisation?  Will IP restrictions  be claimed  for the data  you created?  If \nso, for what  data  and which  restrictions  will be asserted?  \nYes, the pH model  derived  from dataset  1-4 is of interest  for valorisation  by the soil service  of \nBelgium.  The IP will be valorised  by a cooperation  agreement  where  the soil service  may use this           \nmodel  for consulting  in return  for a financial  return  to KU Leuven.  \nThe bayesian  belief  network  is of interest  for both broadening  the consultancy goal  from soil advise  \nto trees  and  biodiversity . \nThe data remain  property  of the KU Leuven.  \n \n \n \n3.4. Do existing  3rd party  agreements  restrict  dissemination  or exploitation  of the \ndata  you (re)use?  If so, to what  data  do they  relate  and what  restrictions  regarding  \nreuse  and sharing  are in place?  \nNo \n \n4. Documentation  and metadata  \n4.1. What  documentation  will be provided  to enable  understanding  and reuse  of the \ndata collected/generated  in this project?  \nFor each  workpackage  a README -file will be included  that explains  the scope,  and methodology  \nof the experiments  and why a certain  setup  was chosen.  \nFor each  experiment  (=spreadsheet)  there  is METADATA  (.txt. -file) that describes  each  column  \nand its units  and the most  important  statistical  analyses . \n \n \n4.2. Will a metadata  standard  be used?  If so, describe  in detail  which  standard  will be \nused.  If not, state  in detail  which  metadata  will be created  to make  the data \neasy/easier  to find and reuse.  \nYes, we are currently  develo ping a general  strategy  (rolling out in Spring  2023)  where   everything  \nis saved  on Onedrive,  and access  is given  to the promotor.  \n \n5. Data  storage  and backup  during  the project  \n5.1. Where  will the data  be stored?  \nThe master  copy of the data,  i.e. active  working  data during  the project,  is kept on the personal  \nlaptop of the researcher (Robrecht Van Der Bauwhede) which is backed up to OneDrive, this  \ncloud  is used as the research  unit's  central  storage  facility  to which  the promotors  of the project  \nhave  access.  \nFurthermore,  the project  is backed  up by the division  of forest,  nature  and landscape's  K-drive.  \n \n5.2. How  will the data  be backed  up? \nThe data will be stored  on the university's  central  servers  with automatic  daily  back-up \nprocedures  (Onedrive)  and periodic  back-ups to the division's  K-drive  (every  month).  \n5.3.
