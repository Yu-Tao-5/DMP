Despite this recent influx of structural information,  \nhowever,  we  still  do  not  fully  understand  how  differential  intrinsic  properties  of  amyloid  \nstrains/conformers,  such  as  their  morphology, co-aggregation potential  and transmissibility barriers  \nrelate to selective cellular/tissue toxicity and aggregation spreading patterns or the role they play in the  \nprogression of neurodegenerative disorders. This complexity increases even further when considering  \nsystemic or other localised forms of amyloidosis. \nWe desperately need fresh approaches to diagnose and potentially treat amyloid diseases, therefore, I  \npropose to develop a high-throughput screening platform for the analysis of strain-specific propagation  \nrates and structural features of patient-derived amyloids at an unprecedented resolution. I will integrate  \ncutting-edge single-molecule techniques (microfluidics, AFM-FTIR, cryo-electron microscopy, and high-\ncontent cellular screens) and will take advantage of the availability of patient-derived material to build a  \ncomprehensive database of disease-associated diagnostic markers of major proteinopathies. I will use this  \ndatabase and the integrated infrastructure to find cell-autonomous aggregation modulators and for the  \nfast and accurate screening of novel amyloid-specific inhibitors with therapeutic potential.\nInstitutions: KU Leuven\n1.

LEGAL & ETHICAL ISSUES\nWill you use personal data?  If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add the \nreference to the file in KU Leuven's Record of Processing Activities.   Be aware that registering the fact \nthat you process personal data is a legal obligation.\n●No\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on \nhumans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant ethical \nreview committee(s)\n●Yes\nHuman tissue samples will be used in the framework of study protocol S63759 approved by the Ethical \nCommittee of Research of UZ/KU Leuven.  \nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? Will \nIP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions will be \nasserted? \n●Yes\nThe goal of the project is to develop a method that has great diagnostic potential and we hope that the \nproposed work will lead to tech transfer and valorisation of the research data. VIB and KU Leuven has a \npolicy to actively monitor research data for such potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention \nwill be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of cases the invention will be IP protected (mostly patent \nprotection or copyright protection). As such the IP protection does not withhold the research data from \nbeing made public. In the case a decision is taken to file a patent application it will be planned so that \npublications need not be delayed. Further research beyond the scope of this project may be necessary \nfor developing a strong IP portfolio.\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If so, \nto what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\n●No\n4. DOCUMENTATION & METADATA\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this project?\nMetadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and \nanalysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook) and/or in hard copy \nlab notebooks that refer to specific datasets. All datasets will be accompanied by a README.txt file \ncontaining all the associated metadata (see more details below). The data will be generated following \nstandardized protocols. Clear and detailed descriptions of these protocols will be stored in our lab \nprotocol database, and published along with the results.  \nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used.  If no, state in \ndetail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse.\nThe following metadata standards will be used for certain datasets\nNucleotide sequence files (vectors and sequencing) : GenBank Sequence Format \n(https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.rg2vmt )\n16Protein structures will be saved in Protein Data Bank Format (PDB) \n(https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.9y4cqw ) \nFor sharing computer code, we use the  Zenodo format (https://zenodo.org/) \nFor instrument-specific datasets, additional metadata will be associated with the data file as \nappropriate.\nFor other datasets, the metadata will include the following elements:  \nTitle: free text\nCreator: Last name, first name, organization\nDate and time reference\nSubject: Choice of keywords and classifications\nDescription: Text explaining the content of the data set and other contextual information \nneeded for the correct interpretation of the data, the software(s) (including version number) \nused to produce and to read the data, the purpose of the experiment, etc.\nFormat: Details of the file format,\nResource Type: data set, image, audio, etc.\nIdentifier: DOI (when applicable)\nAccess rights: closed access, embargoed access, restricted access, open access.\nThe final dataset will be accompanied by a README.txt document. This file will be located in the top-\nlevel directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming \nconvention used. This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add \ncontextual value to the dataset for future reuse.  \n5. DATA STORAGE & BACK UP DURING THE FWO PROJECT\nWhere will the data be stored?  \nDigital files will be stored either on KU Leuven servers or in shared laboratory folders of an off-site \nonline backup service. The researchers working on the project will have copies of the data files as well as  \nof the derived and compiled data stored on their personal computers.\nThe Switch Lab has a professional subscription to an off-site online backup service with unlimited space, \nversion control and roll-back capability, which will be used for storage during the project and after. \nThere is a secondary on-campus physical backup of the online storage which synchronizes with the \nonline content with a one-day delay.\nAlgorithms, scripts and softwares: All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software code driving the \nproject will be stored in a private online git repository from the GitHub account of the department \n(https://github.com/vibcbd).\nThe screening core has a database system in place to handle the data stream from the high content \nimaging screen, including archiving facilities and will store the data during the project. Representative \nimages and the quantitation of the images will be transferred to the Switch laboratory storage for long \nterm storage.\nVectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, \nboth under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock (-80°C). All \npublished vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the non-profit plasmid repository \nAddgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request.\nCell lines: Newly created cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid nitrogen storage and \nwill be deposited in the UZ Leuven-KU Leuven Biobank.\n17Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as \nappropriate.\nHow is back up of the data provided?\nThe Switch Lab has a professional subscription to an off-site online backup service with unlimited space, \nversion control and roll-back capability, which will be used for storage during the project and after. \nThere is a secondary on-campus physical backup of the online storage which synchronizes with the \nonline content with a one-day delay.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If \nno or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will be taken care \nof.\n●Yes\nThe Switch Lab has a professional subscription to an off-site online backup service with unlimited space, \nwhich will be used for storage during the project and after.  \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these costs be \ncovered? \nData storage and backup costs are included in general lab costs. The Switch Lab has a yearly subscription  \nto an off-site online backup service paid from the general budget of the laboratory. The yearly cost of \nthe service is 5500 Euros. This cost includes unlimited data storage, not only the data belonging to the \npresent project.\nElectricity costs for the -80° and -20° freezers and refrigerators present in the labs as well as the cost of \nliquid nitrogen cryostorage are included in general lab costs.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by \nunauthorized persons?\nAll notebooks and physical data are stored in the labs. Entry to the lab requires ID-card and key. Access \nto the digital data is u-number and password controlled.  \n6. DATA PRESERVATION AFTER THE FWO PROJECT\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a \nselection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons  for this (legal or contractual \nrestrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nThe minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets.  \nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nFor the datasets that will be made openly accessible, we will use, whenever possible, the existing \nplatforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of publication.  \nFor all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows: -Digital datasets will be stored on \nstorage space of an online data-backup service. -Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently \nobtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer)  \nand as a bacterial glycerol stock (-80°C). -Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or \nas frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate.  \n18What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will \nthe costs be covered?  \nElectricity costs for the -80° and -20° freezers and refrigerators present in the labs as well as for in liquid \nnitrogen cryostorage are included in general lab costs. The cost of the laboratory's professional \nsubscription to the online data backup service is 5500 Euros per year (27 500 Euros for 5 years). This cost  \nincludes unlimited data storage, not only the data belonging to the present project. Data storage and \nbackup costs are included in general lab costs.  \n7. DATA SHARING AND REUSE\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an \nagreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\n●No\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nParticipants to the present project are committed to publish research results to communicate them to \npeers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made openly \naccessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to publication, either on \nan individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new collaborators, or publicly via \nrepositories (e.g. negative data). We aim at communicating our results in top journals that require full \ndisclosure upon publication of all included data, either in the main text, in supplementary material or in \na data repository if requested by the journal and following deposit advice given by the journal. \nDepending on the journal, accessibility restrictions may apply. Physical data (e.g. cell lines) will be \ndistributed to other parties if requested.  \nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\n●The data will be shared upon request by mail.\n●Possible ways of sharing the generated data:\nnucleic acid sequences: GenBank ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/ )\nprotein sequences: UniProt KB ( https://www.uniprot.org/ )\nvectors: AddGene (http://www.addgene.org/depositing/start-deposit/ )\ncell lines: direct mailing on dry ice\nmicroscope images: Image Data Resource ( http://idr.openmicroscopy.org/about/ )\nproteomics data: PRIDE ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ )\nmanuscripts: bioRxiv ( https://www.biorxiv.org/ )\nother digital data: Zenodo data repository ( https://zenodo.org/)\nWhen will the data be made available?\n●Upon publication of the research results\nGenerally, research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at the time of publication. No \nembargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, potential IP requirements – note \nthat patent application filing will be planned so that publications need not be delayed - or ongoing \nprojects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be made publicly available as soon as \nthe embargo date is reached.  \nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nWhenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through \nrepositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain sufficient \n19information to support data interpretation and reuse and will be conform to community norms. These \nrepositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 \nUniversal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication, a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY)   or an ODC Public \nDomain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties  \nwill thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used \nby citing the corresponding DOI. For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a \nnon-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly \ndescribe the types of reuse that are permitted.  \nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?  \nIt is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for \nmetadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-\nuse data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be \ncovered by the laboratory budget.\nThe receiving party will pay for sharing physical data (e.g. cell lines).\n8. RESPONSIBILITIES\nWho will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?\nMetadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and \nanalysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook) that refer to specific  \ndatasets. \nWho will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nThe research and technical staff will ensure data storage and back up, with support from René Custers \nand Alexander Botzki for the electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) and from Raf De Coster for the KU \nLeuven drives. \nWho will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ?\nThe PI is responsible for data preservation and sharing, with support from the research and technical \nstaff involved in the project, from René Custers and Alexander Botzki for the electronic laboratory \nnotebook (ELN) and from Raf De Coster for the KU Leuven drives.  \nWho bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nThe PI is ultimately responsible for all data management during and after data collection, including \nimplementing and updating the DMP.

Despite this recent influx of structural information, however, we still do not fully understand how differential intrinsic properties of amyloid strains/conformers, such as their morphology, co-aggregation potential and transmissibility barriers relate to selective cellular/tissue toxicity and aggregation spreading patterns or the role they play in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. This complexity increases even further when considering systemic or other localised forms of amyloidosis. We desperately need fresh approaches to diagnose and potentially treat amyloid diseases, therefore, I propose to develop a high-throughput screening platform for the analysis of strain-specific propagation rates and structural features of patient-derived amyloids at an unprecedented resolution. I will integrate cutting-edge single-molecule techniques (microfluidics, AFM-FTIR, cryo-electron microscopy, and high- content cellular screens) and will take advantage of the availability of patient-derived material to build a comprehensive database of disease-associated diagnostic markers of major proteinopathies. I will use this database and the integrated infrastructure to find cell-autonomous aggregation modulators and for the fast and accurate screening of novel amyloid-specific inhibitors with therapeutic potential.

LEGAL & ETHICAL ISSUES Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add the reference to the file in KU Leuven's Record of Processing Activities. Be aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation. ●No Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant ethical review committee(s) ●Yes Human tissue samples will be used in the framework of study protocol S63759 approved by the Ethical Committee of Research of UZ/KU Leuven. Does your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted? ●Yes The goal of the project is to develop a method that has great diagnostic potential and we hope that the proposed work will lead to tech transfer and valorisation of the research data. VIB and KU Leuven has a policy to actively monitor research data for such potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of cases the invention will be IP protected (mostly patent protection or copyright protection). As such the IP protection does not withhold the research data from being made public. In the case a decision is taken to file a patent application it will be planned so that publications need not be delayed. Further research beyond the scope of this project may be necessary for developing a strong IP portfolio. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place? ●No 4. DOCUMENTATION & METADATA What documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this project? Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook) and/or in hard copy lab notebooks that refer to specific datasets. All datasets will be accompanied by a README.txt file containing all the associated metadata (see more details below). The data will be generated following standardized protocols. Clear and detailed descriptions of these protocols will be stored in our lab protocol database, and published along with the results. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used. If no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse. The following metadata standards will be used for certain datasets Nucleotide sequence files (vectors and sequencing) : GenBank Sequence Format (https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.rg2vmt ) 16Protein structures will be saved in Protein Data Bank Format (PDB) (https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.9y4cqw ) For sharing computer code, we use the Zenodo format (https://zenodo.org/) For instrument-specific datasets, additional metadata will be associated with the data file as appropriate. For other datasets, the metadata will include the following elements: Title: free text Creator: Last name, first name, organization Date and time reference Subject: Choice of keywords and classifications Description: Text explaining the content of the data set and other contextual information needed for the correct interpretation of the data, the software(s) (including version number) used to produce and to read the data, the purpose of the experiment, etc. Format: Details of the file format, Resource Type: data set, image, audio, etc. Identifier: DOI (when applicable) Access rights: closed access, embargoed access, restricted access, open access. The final dataset will be accompanied by a README.txt document. This file will be located in the top- level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used. This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse. 5. DATA STORAGE & BACK UP DURING THE FWO PROJECT Where will the data be stored? Digital files will be stored either on KU Leuven servers or in shared laboratory folders of an off-site online backup service. The researchers working on the project will have copies of the data files as well as of the derived and compiled data stored on their personal computers. The Switch Lab has a professional subscription to an off-site online backup service with unlimited space, version control and roll-back capability, which will be used for storage during the project and after. There is a secondary on-campus physical backup of the online storage which synchronizes with the online content with a one-day delay. Algorithms, scripts and softwares: All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software code driving the project will be stored in a private online git repository from the GitHub account of the department (https://github.com/vibcbd). The screening core has a database system in place to handle the data stream from the high content imaging screen, including archiving facilities and will store the data during the project. Representative images and the quantitation of the images will be transferred to the Switch laboratory storage for long term storage. Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock (-80°C). All published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request. Cell lines: Newly created cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid nitrogen storage and will be deposited in the UZ Leuven-KU Leuven Biobank. 17Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate. How is back up of the data provided? The Switch Lab has a professional subscription to an off-site online backup service with unlimited space, version control and roll-back capability, which will be used for storage during the project and after. There is a secondary on-campus physical backup of the online storage which synchronizes with the online content with a one-day delay. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will be taken care of. ●Yes The Switch Lab has a professional subscription to an off-site online backup service with unlimited space, which will be used for storage during the project and after. What are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these costs be covered? Data storage and backup costs are included in general lab costs. The Switch Lab has a yearly subscription to an off-site online backup service paid from the general budget of the laboratory. The yearly cost of the service is 5500 Euros. This cost includes unlimited data storage, not only the data belonging to the present project. Electricity costs for the -80° and -20° freezers and refrigerators present in the labs as well as the cost of liquid nitrogen cryostorage are included in general lab costs. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? All notebooks and physical data are stored in the labs. Entry to the lab requires ID-card and key. Access to the digital data is u-number and password controlled. 6. DATA PRESERVATION AFTER THE FWO PROJECT Which data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...). The minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets. Where will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)? For the datasets that will be made openly accessible, we will use, whenever possible, the existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of publication. For all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows: -Digital datasets will be stored on storage space of an online data-backup service. -Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacterial glycerol stock (-80°C). -Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate. 18What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered? Electricity costs for the -80° and -20° freezers and refrigerators present in the labs as well as for in liquid nitrogen cryostorage are included in general lab costs. The cost of the laboratory's professional subscription to the online data backup service is 5500 Euros per year (27 500 Euros for 5 years). This cost includes unlimited data storage, not only the data belonging to the present project. Data storage and backup costs are included in general lab costs. 7. DATA SHARING AND REUSE Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? ●No Which data will be made available after the end of the project? Participants to the present project are committed to publish research results to communicate them to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made openly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new collaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. negative data). We aim at communicating our results in top journals that require full disclosure upon publication of all included data, either in the main text, in supplementary material or in a data repository if requested by the journal and following deposit advice given by the journal. Depending on the journal, accessibility restrictions may apply. Physical data (e.g. cell lines) will be distributed to other parties if requested. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? ●The data will be shared upon request by mail. ●Possible ways of sharing the generated data: nucleic acid sequences: GenBank ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/ ) protein sequences: UniProt KB ( https://www.uniprot.org/ ) vectors: AddGene (http://www.addgene.org/depositing/start-deposit/ ) cell lines: direct mailing on dry ice microscope images: Image Data Resource ( http://idr.openmicroscopy.org/about/ ) proteomics data: PRIDE ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ ) manuscripts: bioRxiv ( https://www.biorxiv.org/ ) other digital data: Zenodo data repository ( https://zenodo.org/) When will the data be made available? ●Upon publication of the research results Generally, research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at the time of publication. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, potential IP requirements – note that patent application filing will be planned so that publications need not be delayed - or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be made publicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain sufficient 19information to support data interpretation and reuse and will be conform to community norms. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication, a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) or an ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered? It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to- use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. The receiving party will pay for sharing physical data (e.g. cell lines). 8. RESPONSIBILITIES Who will be responsible for data documentation & metadata? Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook) that refer to specific datasets. Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project? The research and technical staff will ensure data storage and back up, with support from René Custers and Alexander Botzki for the electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) and from Raf De Coster for the KU Leuven drives. Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ? The PI is responsible for data preservation and sharing, with support from the research and technical staff involved in the project, from René Custers and Alexander Botzki for the electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) and from Raf De Coster for the KU Leuven drives. Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP? The PI is ultimately responsible for all data management during and after data collection, including implementing and updating the DMP."
