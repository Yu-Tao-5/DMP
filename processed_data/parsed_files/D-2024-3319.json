The impact of single degradation\nmechanisms of either carbonation- or chloride-induced corrosion is well-studied and service life prediction of RC structures is based on\nthese single actions. However, this is not always realistic for on-site situations as both processes typically occur combined over\nthe lifetime of the structure and may reinforce each other. Moreover, an important challenge lies in making long-term predictions for field\nperformance based on short-term laboratory testing. Current applied accelerated tests are not representative to mimic natural\nconditions. This project aims to fundamentally understand natural combined corrosion mechanisms in RC structures by using advanced\nnon-destructive techniques. Corrosion-induced damage due to single and combined actions is investigated. The effect of corrosion\nacceleration is studied. The findings in the laboratory are compared with samples extracted from case studies to identify differences\nbetween laboratory-made and on-site samples. The analyses are performed with advanced non-destructive techniques such as X-ray\nComputed Tomography (XCT) and the Acoustic Emission (AE) technique. Both techniques allow to study the time and space distribution\nof the corrosion process (4D-XCT and 4D-AE).
