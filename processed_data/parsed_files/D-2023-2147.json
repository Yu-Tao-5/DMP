The Strawson-Hart Account and the Responsibility-First\nApproach\nA Data Management Plan created using DMPonline.be\nCreator: \nBenjamin De Mesel\nAffiliation: \nKU Leuven (KUL)\nFunder: \nFonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)\nTemplate: \nFWO DMP (Flemish Standard DMP)\nGrant number / URL: \nG026923N\nID: \n199261\nStart date: \n01-10-2023\nEnd date: \n30-09-2026\nProject abstract:\nI have two main objectives. (1) To develop a new account, the\nStrawson-Hart account, of the nature of morality. (2) To present a new approach, the responsibility-first approach, to the study of moral\nresponsibility.\nI start from the thought that P.F. Strawson’s ‘Freedom and\nResentment’, the key text in responsibility theory, cannot be\nunderstood without grasping Strawson’s conception of morality. I argue that H.L.A. Hart’s work sheds light on Strawson’s. Their\naccounts of morality are mutually enriching, which makes it possible to develop a ‘Strawson-Hart account’. I argue that this account is\nconvincing and distinct from existing ones. Moreover, the similarities between law and morals highlighted in the Strawson-Hart account\nopen up the possibility of a new approach to the study of moral responsibility, the ‘responsibility-first approach’. The key idea here is that,\ninstead of explaining responsibility in supposedly more basic terms like freedom, responsibility is itself explanatorily basic. I show\nhow the responsibility-first approach can deal with skepticism about responsibility through a new, historically informed and empirically\nsupported argument.\nThis project promises to yield substantial gains. It may have a deep impact on debates about the nature of morality and responsibility, it\nwill enhance the understanding of two major 20th century analytic philosophers, and it will show how historically informed work leads to\noriginal contributions to contemporary debates.\nLast modified: \n02-05-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
