At the luminal side of the intestine, new\nCD lesions recur within weeks to months in two-thirds of patients undergoing surgery, but only in\nthe presence of the fecal stream. At the external side of the intestine, a pathognomic\nphenomenon of CD is observed, ie.creeping fat, which is a local hyperplasia of mesenteric\nadipose tissue migrating to the sites of intestinal inflammation. However, which luminal\ncomponents are triggering post-operative recurrence and whether creeping fat has a\npathological or protective role in CD, is still not clear. \nThe current project aims to identify triggers\nof post-operative recurrent CD, by focusing both on the external and the luminal side of the\nintestine. First, we will profile the lipidomic landscape of creeping and paired mesenteric fat at\nthe time of surgery, and assess if these lipid signatures are predictive for post-operative\nrecurrence. Next, we will characterize fecal components predicting recurrence by combining\nshotgun metagenomics with metabolomics. Furthermore, to get a better functional\nunderstanding, these fecal contents will also be exposed to their ileal epithelial cells using in\nvitro 2D transwells derived from organoids, followed by epithelial RNA sequencing as a readout.\nOverall, the clinical value of this project lies in a better understanding of creeping fat being\npathognomonic for CD, and in identifying predictive markers for post-operative recurrence, both\nexternal and luminal. The findings from the different analyses will enable to identify pointers for\nnew therapies or repurposing of existing drugs. Moreover, the impact for patients suffering from\nCD is that early strategies can be developed to identify and to treat patients at risk for disease\nrecurrence to ultimately reduce surgery rates.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered? The cost of archival on KU Leuven servers is estimated to be between 50 and 75 EUR for the 5 years after project end. Funding is available in our group to cover these costs. 7. Data sharing and reuse Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Yes. Specify: The informed consent contains a section in which the participant can if choose his/her data is shared, including sharing data within non-Belgian countries towards international scientific collaborations, including biotechnological or pharmaceutical companies. We will honour their choice. Furthermore, shared data will always be pseudonymised. Which data will be made available after the end of the project? This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 7 of 8 All data obtained can be available after publication. In case of sequencing data, these datasets will be deposited to NCBI. Applied codes can be made available on Github Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? In an Open Access repository Upon request by mail In open Access repository: In case of sequencing data, these datasets will be deposited to NCBI. Applied codes can be made available on Github Upon request by email Data is stored in the central server of KU Leuven and will be available upon request at least 5 years after the project. The information regarding this data can be found in the publications related to the project and the responsible PI will provide the requested data. All patient-related information is protected by the UZ Leuven. If the participants have allowed that their data can be reused, other researchers can ask for the data. The data will be provided using a secure medium, e.g. the filesender of Belnet. When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories. As detailed above, metadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use. For data shared upon request, a data transfer agreement will be concluded with the involved parties in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered? None, the filesender of Belnet is for free. 8. Responsibilities Who will be responsible for data documentation & metadata? The researcher (Sare Verstockt) and PI (Séverine Vermeire) are responsible for data documentation & metadata Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project? The researcher (Sare Verstockt) and PI (Séverine Vermeire) are responsible for data storage & back up during the project Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ? The PI (Séverine Vermeire) is responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP? The PI (Séverine Vermeire) bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP. The DMP will be evaluated at regular meetings between the researcher and the PI during the project This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 8 of 8"
