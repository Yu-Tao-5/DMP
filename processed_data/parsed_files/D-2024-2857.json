Most of the foods we are\nexposed to are unhealthy and often they are not the most sustainable option either. Both personal and planetary health are thus jeopardized. For\nadolescents, habituated to social media and its afflux of foods portrayed, this comes as a specific challenge. Furthermore, there’s an urgent need for\ninsights in how more vulnerable subgroups such as those with lower social class are affected. HashtagToFork aims to deliver fundamental insights in\n(a) the effect of social media on adolescents’ (un)healthy and (un)sustainable nutrition behavior, (b) the mediating role of perceived social norms in\nthis process, and (c) how objective and subjective social class moderate these processes. This will result in communication strategy recommendations\nfor the healthy and sustainable food system stakeholders, and policy recommendations concerning social media food messages.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n26-03-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? For now, the faculty of social sciences is covering the storage costs. This might change in the future. The costs for additional storage beyond the project duration will be covered by a budget line from Tim Smits.
