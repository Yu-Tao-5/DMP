Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nReuse existing data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nUsed Data:\nPython code: DyntaPy traffic assignment source code developed within the group with open\nsource license.\nBelgian traffic demand available via MOW: namely xls files and shape (.shp) files 1-5 GB. \nCASADI (https://web.casadi.org/): It has a permissive license such\nthat we are allowed to freely use them in a software project with not necessarily the\nsame license.\nGenerated Data:\nMATLAB and Python codes for optimisation of transport policy variables like tolls.\nPTV VISUM Static Traffic Assignment Models of different settings and cities. 1-50 GB\nxls files for traffic volumes in response of different policy variable values for different cities. \n1-10 GB\n3. Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNo\nPrivacy Registry Reference: Not Applicable\nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used: Not Applicable\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 4\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nNo\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nYes\nWe work with open source licenses with the restriction that everyone who uses our data or tools\nmust also make their tools or data available open source as well. For commercial use or other\nuse types that are excluded from the open-source license, license needs to be negotiated with\nKUL/LRD.\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nRaw simulation data will be collected per simulation test, including a txt file with a clear\ndescription of what the data represent and how they were generated. This text file will also be\navailable in the GIT repository for anyone willing to re-use the data internally or externally. The\ninput files used for the simulation will be kept in the same folder. \nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nMost simulation data will be stored in CSV and xls files and will be accompanied\nby metadata headers. We will ensure all metadata are described consistently\nduring the project and well documented. This will facilitate the reuse of our datasets,\nboth internally and externally.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\n1\n. \nAll the tools and data are regularly committed to the Git repository of the group i.e.\nITSCrealab and/or to KUL OneDrive folders during the active research phase. \n2\n. \nIn addition, a copy is stored on researcher's work computer which has already been\npurchased prior to FWO grant . \n3\n. \nThe outcome data will be stored on Gitlab, split in public (for open-source output) and\nprivate folders (for internal reuse).\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nKU Leuven provided Gitlab and OneDrive have adequate backup strategies in place. In case of\ndata loss or damage, we can easily revert to our software or data. \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nYes. KUL OneDrive and Gitlab quota are sufficient for the entirety of the project.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nCurrently, existing quota are sufficient. KUL offers large-volume storage and archiving services\n(\nhttps://admin.kuleuven.be/icts/onderzoek/dlm\n) at rates ~€99/TB, but it is not expected that\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 4\nthese will be required for this project as data volumes remain small.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nOur Git repository can only be modified by the researcher or the group GIT managers.\nOnly the researcher has access to his work computer. KUL works with multi-factor authentication\n(\nhttps://set.kuleuven.be/set-it/news/for-security-choose-multi-factor-authentication\n) and is\npermanently monitoring and updating its web security performance and policy.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nThe GIT repository of the group stays in tact irrespective of people finishing their research and\nmoving on to other projects.\nAll data related to publications will necessarily be retained along with other important\nunpublished data.
