Currently there are no\nsymptomatic or disease modifying treatments for MSA patients. The major neuropathological\nhallmark are alpha-synuclein (aSYN) protein aggregates, which are mostly found in\noligodendrocytes. Most studies have focused on the central nervous system (CNS), but recent\nevidence has shown aSYN aggregates in the urinary tract of MSA patients, which correlates with\nurinary dysfunction being one of the earliest symptoms. aSYNâ€™s ability to propagate like a\nprion supports the hypothesis that the disease may start in the periphery and later advance to\nthe brain when the motor deficits appear. We hypothesize that peripheral inflammatory insults,\nsuch as infections, could act as triggers of MSA in susceptible individuals. To develop disease-\nmodifying therapies for MSA we rely on limited understanding of the disease aetiology. In this\nproject we aim to develop a novel MSA model to study aSYN propagation from the urinary tract\nto the CNS as a potential contributor to disease pathogenesis. Additionally, we aim to elucidate\nthe role of infections as triggers or modifiers of disease progression. This project will provide new\ninsight into pathogenic mechanisms leading to MSA together with the development of tools that\ncan be used for prospective modelling or therapeutic approaches.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
