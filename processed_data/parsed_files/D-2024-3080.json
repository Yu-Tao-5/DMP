Main results and methods will be published in peer-reviewed journals (open access as required by KU Leuven Internal Funding regulations) and all publications will be archived in Lirias, the digital KU Leuven document repository. All digital data digital data generated in the project for each WP and associated metadata will be archived digitally and a searchable database format (Excel or Access) will be implemented. Electronic lab note books will be used and templates have been designed for writing protocols/SOPs, for excel spreadsheets for raw data and (statistical) analysis. When raw data are uploaded on repositories, keywords will be affixed along with readme files containing the needed information for reuse. In the final stage of the project, a master index file with the combined metadata for each WP will be generated and archived on a non-editable drive of the host institution KU Leuven (‘K drive’). All physical data physical data collected during the course of the project will be stored at designated storage places (at room temperature or frozen) and location and preservation method of the biological samples (tissues, tissue sections, blood plasma, genetic material) will be documented digitally (.xlsx files).

Yes Metadata will be a combination of machine-generated and manually generated metadata. Metadata of raw images (file size, pixel number, acquisition date, settings, etc. ) and qRT-PCR are captured automatically and saved on the server together with the corresponding data files. Other metadata (on quantification procedures, biochemical analysis, etc. ) are mostly captured manually and logged in lab notebooks or in searchable Excel/Access databases. For these metadata, we will progressively design own metadata standards using http://dublincore.rog/. We will also consider archiving our data using general data repositories (https://figshare.com/ and https://zenodo.org/). RNAseq data will be uploaded to the GEO repository which uses the MIAME standard.

Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution Researchers’ computers are backed-up through constant synchronisation synchronisation to the Box cloud of the KU Leuven (which provides 100 GB storage per KU Leuven researcher). The KU Leuven network drives and the UZ Leuven central server are automatically backed-up on a daily basis. Continuous KU Leuven network drive back-up is guaranteed and supervised by the KU Leuven ICT service and makes use of ‘snapshot’ technology. Once data sets do no longer need to be accesses and/or modified, ( e.g. , after publication of manuscripts), archiving to a read-only KU Leuven network drive (the K drive) will be done to maintain a copy.

Digital data Digital data : The KU Leuven network servers allow for secure storage of non-personal data and are compatible with GDPR regulations. The access to the KU Leuven server is u-number and password controlled. KU Leuven ICTS services provide the option to control data access for authorised persons only (in this case, KU Leuven affiliated research lab members involved in this project). For personal patient data stored on the UZ Leuven central server, access will be restricted with access right management only to clinical data manager Annemie Devroye and by Prof. R. Lemmens.
