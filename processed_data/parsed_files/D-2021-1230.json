For all data, common metadata are collected: (1) title,\n(2) author, (3) data type, (4) data created and date modified, (5) file size, (6) equipment\nreference (such as manufacturer and model identification. Depending on the nature of data\nadditional metadata are collected. Microscopy: (7) lense type, pinwholes, gain, laserstrength and\nmagnification. FACS: (8) channels used. Fluorescence: (9) wavelength.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nThe host institute provides a storage capacity of 2 TB per person with regular backup system\n(OneDrive) so the data will be stored there for active use and copies can be made and kept on\npersonal devices. Also, the PI of the laboratory pays for storage space (100 GB) on the network\ndrives of KU Leuven (J drive). The data will be stored there as well.\n \nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers (OneDrive) with automatic daily back-\nup procedures.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project?

How\nwill these costs be covered?\nOneDrive storage is provided by the host institution and the 100 GB network drive (J drive) is\npaid by the PI, Frederic Lluis in the price of 51,9 euros per year. \nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nBoth storage spaces (OneDrive and J drive) need my authorization for access. They are secured\nwith my KU Leuven credentials.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAfter the research: Copy of the laboratory notebooks and electronic data will be stored by the PI,\nProf. Frederic Lluis, who will be responsible for data preservation for at least 5 years after the end\nof the research.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 4\nData will be indefinetely stored in J drive paid by the PI. \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nThe obtained data will be stored on the 100 GB network drive (J drive) which is paid by the PI,\nFrederic Lluis in the price of 51,9 euros per year. \n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nNo\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nAll data can be available upon publication. Bioinformatics data are put on public repositories.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nUpon request by mail\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nPublished data are accessible to all.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nMost of the data are put without costs on public repositories.\n8. Responsibilities\nWho will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?\nI will be responsible for the producing data, for data documentation and metadata. \nWho will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nData storage and back-up is my responsibility. The responsibility for maintaining the\ninfrastructure access for data storage lies in the hands of the IT responsible of the research\nteam. Finally, the maintenance of servers and integrity of data stored on\nthese servers underlies the ITC services of the university.\nWho will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ?\nThe host instituteâ€™s IT team is responsible for digital preservation.\nWho bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nI, Paraskevi Athanasouli, bear the responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 4"
