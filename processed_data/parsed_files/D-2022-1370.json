Personalized medicine for CF patients not eligible for registered modulator\ntreatments \n- To screen for novel CFTR modulator combinations, both approved or in clinical\ndevelopment, to functionally rescue rare CFTR mutations for which the effect of approved\nmodulators is unknown. \nReached when 30 organoid samples from the KULeuven biobank are\ntested with CFTR modulators in 6 different combinations. (WP 1.1) \n- To develop novel tailored\nprime editing strategies for drug-refractory or non-druggable CFTR mutations. Mutations will be\nprioritized based on their prevalence and the availability in the organoid biobank, with priority to\npatient samples with two non-responsive mutations \nReached when an allele-specific correction of\nthe targeted CFTR mutations (n=7) is achieved on the genomic and functional level, with minimal\noff-target activity. For genotypes where the second allele is potentially rescuable by CFTR\nmodulators, the best drug (or drug combination) for that specific mutation (obtained through the\nfirst objective) will be combined with the gene editing treatment to assess a potential additive\neffect. (WP1.2) \n2. To develop and validate a novel microfluidic High-Throughput Screening (HTS)\nplatform with increased test capacity on smaller organoid samples to allow rapid and in vitro\ndrug HTS in a personalized medicine approach, as well as a phenotypically directed single\norganoid picking platform for downstream applications. \nReached when (1) the results of the CFTR\nassay based on rectal organoids in wells can be replicated in the HTS platform in droplets (WP2)\nand (2) the microfluidic HTS platform has performed automated screening of 80 different\ncombinations of modulators in organoids from 55 different patients and of gRNAs for gene\nediting in patients with selected non-druggable mutations (n=15), thereby establishing the\ncapacity to perform HTS on a patient derived in vitro model (WP3) \nResearch questions are\nmainly: - To which modulator(s) combination do rectal organoids of patients with rare CFTR\nmutations? - What are optimal guides for CRISPR/CAS correction of ultrarare 'non-druggable'\nmutations in rectal organoids - Can the CFTR assay in rectal organoids be applied in a\nmicrofluidic based platform system? - Can we test multiple modulator combinations or guide\ncombination in a microfluidic based platform system? - Do results obtained in the high-\nthroughput microfluidic platform system correlate with the results obtained in the low-trhoughput\norganoid assay?\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

In addition, the members of the\nlaboratory use the OneDrive for daily backup of all personal folders.\n \n5.3. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nThe OneDrive does have limitation in storage capacity (2TB) and provides periodic backups. For\nlarge data the laboratory has an external drive with a 5TB storage capacity which when full can\nbe substituted by another external drive if necessary. The drive is kept in a locked location at the\nOrgnaoid lab.\n5.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nExpected costs for data storage are covered by research grants in the labs of the 3 partners\n5.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not\naccessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nAll data will be retained for at least 10 years after the project. Thus, complying to the data\npreservation rules of KU Leuven.\n6. Data preservation after the end of the project\n6.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the\nproject? If only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is\nthe case (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll data will be retained for at least 10 years after the project. Thus, complying to the data\npreservation rules of KU Leuven.\n6.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)?\nEach research group will maintain the backups on the servers. After the end of the project, data\nmay be maintained on the servers or on hard drives kept in secured places in each lab.\n6.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How\nwill the costs be covered?\nCost of the preservation will depend on volume of data and method of preservation. Storage on\nservers is structurally financed in each research group.\n7. Data sharing and re-use\n7.1. Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data\n(e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions or because of IP\npotential)?\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n5 of 7\nAll data will be generated by the research groups involved, without restrictions for future use\nwithin the scope of the present project.\n7.2. Which data will be made available after the end of the project?\nData with valuable IP will be protected prior to publication. We will strive to comply with open\naccess guidelines at KU Leuven and therefore relevant digital data will be published and made\navailable after the end of the project via public repositories (e.g. zenon-do.org).\nAnonimized example datasets and images will be made available.\n7.3. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nUpon request by mail\nData will be available after signing a data sharing agreement which will be established with the\nsupport of KUL R&D after a request. Once KU Leuven has established a university managed and\nowned data repository sharing of data (or a subset of data) on this repository will be evaluated\ndepending on the policy and conditions of this repository. Changes to the data sharing policy will\nbe reported in the final DMP.\n7.4. When will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nData will be made available after publication in peer reviewed journals. Additional data will be\nmade available on basis of data sharing agreements if requested by third party. The anonymized\ndata could be made available upon publication of the results, only if anonimization can be\nguaranteed (given ultra-rare mutationsin many patients)\n7.5. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nDue to the potential commercial value of data no general and full open access to data will be\nprovided by default. Data which will be shared with third parties will exclude commercial use and\nwill require appropriate credit to the data owners.\n7.6. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nNo data sharing is actually planned.\nThe KU Leuven repository will not request any cost contribution for KU Leuven researchers. Data\nshared through journal repositories will be covered by publication costs. Bilateral agreements for\ndata sharing will be established through the services of KU Leuven R&D. The costs expected for\ndata sharing are thus low and will be reported in the final DMP at the end of the project. They will\nbe covered through funds of the project.\n8. Responsibilities\n8.1. Who will be responsible for the data documentation & metadata?\nThe individual researcher producing data will have the final responsibility for data documentation\nand metadata. In case of PhD students and technical personal the collection will be supervised by\nthe scientific project responsible (Dr. Marianne Carlon, Dr. Anabella Ramalho and Dr. François\nVermeulen, Dr Xevi Casadevall) while remaining the final responsibility of data integrity by the\nresearcher performing the experiments.\n8.2. Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nData storage and back-up underlies the responsibility of the individual researcher, who will be\nsupervised by the scientific coordinator. The responsibility for maintaining the infrastructure\naccess for data storage lies in the hands of the IT responsible of the research team. Finally, the\nmaintenance of servers and integrity of data stored on these servers underlies the ITC services of\nthe university. The maintenance of the integrity of the external drives and the data stored on\nthem will be responsibility of the lab manager (FV).\n8.3. Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and sharing?\nProf François Vermeulen will take responsibility to ensure data preservation, access and reuse.\nEach partner will take care of data preservation for his/her tasks of the project.\n8.4. Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nThe end responsibility for updating and implementing the DMP is with the supervisor (promotor)\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n6 of 7\nFrançois Vermeulen.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n7 of 7"

We will strive to comply with open access guidelines at KU Leuven and therefore relevant digital data will be published and made available after the end of the project via public repositories (e.g. zenon-do.org). Anonimized example datasets and images will be made available. 7.3. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? Upon request by mail Data will be available after signing a data sharing agreement which will be established with the support of KUL R&D after a request. Once KU Leuven has established a university managed and owned data repository sharing of data (or a subset of data) on this repository will be evaluated depending on the policy and conditions of this repository. Changes to the data sharing policy will be reported in the final DMP. 7.4. When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results Data will be made available after publication in peer reviewed journals. Additional data will be made available on basis of data sharing agreements if requested by third party. The anonymized data could be made available upon publication of the results, only if anonimization can be guaranteed (given ultra-rare mutationsin many patients) 7.5. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? Due to the potential commercial value of data no general and full open access to data will be provided by default. Data which will be shared with third parties will exclude commercial use and will require appropriate credit to the data owners. 7.6. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? No data sharing is actually planned. The KU Leuven repository will not request any cost contribution for KU Leuven researchers. Data shared through journal repositories will be covered by publication costs. Bilateral agreements for data sharing will be established through the services of KU Leuven R&D. The costs expected for data sharing are thus low and will be reported in the final DMP at the end of the project. They will be covered through funds of the project. 8. Responsibilities 8.1. Who will be responsible for the data documentation & metadata? The individual researcher producing data will have the final responsibility for data documentation and metadata. In case of PhD students and technical personal the collection will be supervised by the scientific project responsible (Dr. Marianne Carlon, Dr. Anabella Ramalho and Dr. François Vermeulen, Dr Xevi Casadevall) while remaining the final responsibility of data integrity by the researcher performing the experiments. 8.2. Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project? Data storage and back-up underlies the responsibility of the individual researcher, who will be supervised by the scientific coordinator. The responsibility for maintaining the infrastructure access for data storage lies in the hands of the IT responsible of the research team. Finally, the maintenance of servers and integrity of data stored on these servers underlies the ITC services of the university. The maintenance of the integrity of the external drives and the data stored on them will be responsibility of the lab manager (FV). 8.3. Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and sharing? Prof François Vermeulen will take responsibility to ensure data preservation, access and reuse. Each partner will take care of data preservation for his/her tasks of the project. 8.4. Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP? The end responsibility for updating and implementing the DMP is with the supervisor (promotor) This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 6 of 7 François Vermeulen.
