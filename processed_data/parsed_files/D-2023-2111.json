Ultrasonic (US) wave communication has several advantages compared to\nother techniques such as electromagnetic waves, inductive, or capacitive communication: US has lower in-body\nattenuation, it can be highly integrated and miniaturized, and its physiological impact is well-studied. Especially wireless\nbody area networks (WBAN) can benefit from the advantages of in-body US communication.\nRecently we have developed and demonstrated a highly flexible transceiver for US in-body communication. With this\ntwo-chip solution we have provided an answer to some fundamental challenges: we achieved a robust communication\nlink by implementing a custom modulation scheme, and we realized a compact system with a symmetrical end-to-end\nset-up. Moreover, the transceiver can work with mm-size omnidirectional US transducers.\nIn this C3 project, we want to make the step to a device demonstrator. This requires the integration of the full system,\nincluding the US transducer, the battery and the chip in a compact form factor. At the chip level, we will combine all\ncircuits in a single ASIC. Next to this difficult task of miniaturization, the most important remaining challenge is the\nreduction of power consumption of the chip by one order of magnitude, without giving in on the other performance\nmetrics such as transmission range.\nThe demonstrator will form the basis for further valorization activities, which we consider to be mainly the set-up of\nbilateral applied research and development contracts with companies in the fields of medical devices and/or ASIC\ndesign.\nLast modified: \n05-06-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

In those cases where we do have to publish in journals that are behind a paywall (e.g. IEEE journals that are the top\nin the field), we will always make a digital copy of the accepted paper available through an online repository. We will ensure that every publication gets a Digital Object\nIdentifier (DOI) and that we use our ORCID on every publication, so that the identification of the record and of the authors is unambiguous. Next to the Lirias document\nrepository system of KU Leuven, we will also use arXiv, which is a free distribution service and open-access archive.\nData related to published results can be made available through KU Leuven's RDR.\nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. \nThe simulation, design and measurement data with restricted access will only be accessible within KU Leuven, and specifically only to those persons who have been\ngranted access.\nIf a third party requests access to those data, this will be most likely in the frame of a collaboration agreement or a licensing agreement, and then it will be necessary to\ndraw up data transfer or data sharing clauses as part of that agreement.
