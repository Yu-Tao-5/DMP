The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Jan Verbakel  0000-0002-7166-7211\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles\nProject number 1 & title  Temporal trends and drivers of antibiotic failure in the general population\nFunder(s) GrantID 2G076723N\nAffiliation(s) ☒ KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nROR identifier KU Leuven: 05f950310\nPlease provide a short project description Antimicrobial resistance is a serious and growing concern for health systems worldwide. Although the link \nbetween antimicrobial use and resistance is well-established, this association is complex and much \nremains unknown about the exact drivers of antimicrobial resistance. Aim: to investigate temporal trends \nof first-line antibiotic failures in the general population as well as possible risk factors associated with \nincreased incidence of first-line antibiotic failures, by type of infection and antibiotic class. Methods: \nAnalyses will be performed on one of the largest and richest datasets available for research purposes in \nthe world - anonymised electronic health records with >100 million patient-years from 1995 to 2020 from \nthe Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Expected Outcomes: A better understanding of the factors \nassociated with antibiotic failures in routine clinical practice may inform the development of more \ntargeted and effective prevention measures to limit the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Identified \nrisk factors as well as differences between infection types and antibiotic classes may further point towards  \nbiological functions underlying these complications and inform the design of future research.\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.
