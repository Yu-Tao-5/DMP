Therefore, safeguarding these survivorsâ€™ quality of life is\nessential. One of the key elements in the multimodal treatment of these patients is radiotherapy\n(RT). However, neurocognitive decline arises in up to half of all these cranial irradiated patients,\nplacing a heavy burden on the social and economic aspects of the patientsâ€™ lives. To date,\nneither the pathologic processes nor the brain structures most important for neurocognition have\nbeen accurately identified. Together with the use of highly conformal radiotherapy techniques,\nthis knowledge would allow us to selectively spare them from excess dose and thus decrease\nradiotherapy-related toxicity. In this project, we will combine neuropsychological testing with\n(micro)structural and functional MRI in adult brain tumour patients in a multicenter longitudinal\ntrial (n=120). Based on these findings, we aim to increase our knowledge on the extent and\npathogenesis of neurocognitive decline after RT and identify brain structures correlated with this\nlong term toxicity. If successful, we aim to create a mathematical normal tissue complication\nprobability (NTCP) model that can be used to select the optimal RT treatment plan, limiting\nneurotoxic sequelae and providing patient-tailored care in future RT patients.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

The existing CRF’s\n(clinical) and acquired data will first be coded, so there continues to be a link between the data\nand the individual (pseudonymisation). The subject’s name and other identifiers will then be\nstored separately (on-site file) from their research data and replaced with a unique code to\ncreate a new identity for the subject. The original database (on-site file) with personal details will\nbe stored on the local hospital network only (in every centre).

This folder structure will be defined in the\nabovementioned codebook. For organizing and storing medical imaging data, a standard\nstructure for medical imaging will be used (BIDS, see above). A considerable portion of the meta-\ndata is included in the header information of the original MR DICOM images.

Since we will be working with sensitive personal data, data will be pseudonymized as soon as\npossible. Only one record that is linking the pseudonym to the personal data ('Participant\nidentification list') will be kept on a second separate drive, that will be password secured. Access\nwill be granted to researchers directly involved in the maintenance of this database and be kept\nas limited as possible.\n3. MR imaging data will be stored on an external hard drive, and reconstructed files will be\ntransferred to the hospital PACS system and uploaded on the Oncolopace platform. Since we will\ncollaborate with researchers from other research units and groups, we will use both the Aquilab\nOncoplace platform as well as the REDCap platform for active use of the data during the project.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe data will be stored on the university hospital's servers with weekly back-up procedures. The\ninvolved researcher of the local study team will perform the backup and recovery on a secured\nOneDrive (e.g Cumulus UZ Leuven) storage and on an external backup drive.\nPseudonymous data will be stored on the Redcap en Aquilab Onco Place platform.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\n- Personal data: UZ Leuven server, UZ Leuven cumulus OneDrive\n- Pseudonymous data: Redcap and Aquilab Onco Place platform (secured), external back-up hard\ndrive of 6TB\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nThe external back-up on 2 external hard drives will cost approximately 400euros.\nThe Redcap licence costs 40 euros per year, which is funded by Stand Up To Cancer.\nThe Aquilab Oncoplace platform costs 41 000 euro for 4 years, which is funded by Stand Up To\ncancer.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\n1. The identifiable data files from this study will be managed, processed, and stored in a secure\nenvironment of the local hospital (e.g. UZ Leuven). Access will be controlled by PI determined\naccess rights mediated by password protection and customised read/write permissions\n2. The access to the pseudonymised data on the REDCap and Aquilab oncoplace platform will be\nlimited to researchers of the local studyteam only. Only the studyteam of UZ Leuven will have\naccess to all pseudonymised data.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 6\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll data will be retained for at least 10 years years after the end of the project (policy KU Leuven).\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nThe data will be archived on the university hospital servers only. After the end of the study, also\nthe external drives (including the high capacity back-up drive) containing the pseudonymized\ndata will be saved in the hospital.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nThere will be no additional costs after the end of the project.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nYes. Specify:\nWe've signed a contract with Aquilab restricting the data to be shared beyond the project\ncollaborators. After the project, data will be downloaded and stored in a secured enviroment in\nUZ Leuven. The data will be destroyed on the Aquilab Onco Place platform.\n \n \nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nThe full pseudonymized behavioural dataset will be made available after publication of the data,\nupon request with the PI, for clearly defined research purposes and after signing a data sharing\nagreement. Because of the nature of medical imaging data that does not allow for full\nanonymization, even when removing all personal information from the files and defacing the\nimages, this will be kept restricted.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nUpon request by mail\nAs explained above, medical imaging data is rather sensitive personal data. Therefore, re-use\nwithin or outside of the research group will be provided if requested via mail. In this case, only\nthe necessary pseudonymized information will be shared. In case of data sharing outside of the\nstudy team, the universities' privacy and legal experts will be consulted prior to data sharing to\nconform with all current privacy standards and regulate the data sharing process.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nData will only be made available to other researchers after publication of the research results.\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nSharing of pseudonymized data will be considered after a request is submitted explaining the\nplanned reuse. Only uses for research purposes will be allowed and commercial reuse will be\nexcluded. All participants will have signed the informed consent, containing the agreement to\nshare pseudonymized data with other researchers inside or outside KU Leuven (open data). Data\nwill only be shared if the research is approved by the ethical committee and participants will be\ninformed regarding this secondary use. Publications relating to the study will be provided in open\naccess via Lirias.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nNo costs for data sharing are expected. If any occur, they will be covered by the requesting\nParties.\n8.
