The\ngoal is to understand how the cells/tissues deform and fracture under mechanical deformation,\nand the relative biological mechanism that underlines the sensing of the stimuli by the cell\nthrough mechano-sensors such as ion channels. The data are collected and created in order to\nunderstand the mechanical response of the biological materials.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

How will the costs be covered?\nThe data that will be produced will be saved in KU Leuven's servers supported by ICTS. The cost\nis € 99,55 per TB and per year.
