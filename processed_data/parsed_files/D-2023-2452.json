Nippon Victor was founded in 1927 as a Japanese branch of The Victor\nTalking Machine Company and became a prominent player in the East Asian jazz\nmarket by using the Japanese empire as its base. This research aims to study the\nchanging role of Nippon Victor as an actor in disseminating jazz in Japan between\n1927 and 1954, and its impact on the regional development of the music. It takes as\nhypothesis that during this time the popularity of jazz music in Japan and its empire\nwas to a certain extent tied to the transnational working of Nippon Victor and its\ninteraction with the state represented in the form of the Home Ministry, the Imperial\nRule Assistance Association and, during the US occupation, the General\nHeadquarters in the context of constant political change that balanced between\ncosmopolitanism, imperialism and democracy. This PhD project investigates unique\nand hitherto unused source material from Japan and the United States such as the\nSommerer-files of the Hagley Museum in Delaware which were disclosed in 2015, and\nthe memoirs of prewar Nippon Victor management that have been published by former\ncompany employees.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\nData Collection\nWhat data will you collect or create?
