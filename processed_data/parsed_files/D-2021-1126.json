Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nReuse existing data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nMy project is not a scientific empirical project but a philosophical/theoretical one. I will not\ngenerate new data in the sense of measurements/observations or survey data. However, I do use\ndata in a broad sense of collecting PDFs of scientific and philosophical articles, which I read and\nanalyze. I also generate \"data\" in the form of figures for articles, using Adobe Illustrator and\nsometimes Adobe Photoshop. My research is largely stored in the form of notes and essay drafts\nin Microsoft Word. The total filesizes of all of this would be in the neighborhood of <15 GB.\n3. Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNo\nPrivacy Registry Reference:\nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used: NONE\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)?

Documentation and metadata\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 3\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nI take structured notes in Microsoft Word in which I identify which I identify unused research\nsources. I also collect, organize, and store discarded writing material from paper drafts that I\nedited out or had to cut due to word limits for a given publication venue. All of this material is\neasily searchable and I sometimes reuse discarded material that is several years old. This\nmethod has worked fine for my research purposes.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nThe only \"metadata\" necessary for longer-term storage for my research purposes is structured\nnotes in Microsoft Word.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nAll of my research is stored on Dropbox, which provides a backup in case my laptop breaks or is\nstolen. In addition, I regularly back up all of my data on an external hard drive with high capacity\n(8 TB).\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nAll of my research is stored on Dropbox, which provides a backup in case my laptop breaks or is\nstolen.

If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nI have purchased a Dropbox pro subscription and an external hard drive using my personal\nsalary. KU Leuven does not reimburse Dropbox but instead \"Box,\" which functions poorly. And\nthe process for purchasing computer equipment such as an external HD at the Institute of\nPhilosophy is laborious, highly inefficient, and has limited options. It is just simpler to pay for it\nmyself.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nMy data is not sensitive. My computer is password-protected and I lock my doors...\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll data will be retained (all word documents, PDFs of papers, and scientific figures).\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nI maintain my own personal storage of all of the research I've ever done, on Dropbox and\nnumerous external hard drives. I will also upload the relevant data to the KUL central storage\nlater in the project.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nThe costs will be essentially free because I will be paying for the needed storage anyway. I don't\nknow the exact costs of KUL's maintaining my data in their central servers, but it will be\nminiscule.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 3\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nYes. Specify:\nI do not want other people to access and publish my unpublished work. Anything I want to be\navailable to the general public will be published and accessible that way.\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nI will not make my \"data\" available to the general public after completion of my project.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nOther (specify):\nNA\nWhen will the data be made available?\nNA\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nNA\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing?
