It relies on the early accumulation of driver mutations, and also on a combined set of\nsignaling and nongenetic reprogramming events. Metastasis spreading requires tumur cells to enter the blood circulation, thus becoming Circulating\nTumor Cells (CTCs), to spread to distant/vital organs. This is critical step, in which tumor cells appear particularly vulnerable.  A deeper understanding\nof the biology of CTC may help design strategies that eradicate metastasis. \nLittle is known about CTCs in Melanoma, a highly metastatic disease. Herein I propose to develop methods for systematic detection and\ncharacterization of melanoma CTCs. I will use the Met-Track mouse model of metastatic melanoma, engineered by the host lab, in which all\nmetastasis-initiating cells and their descendants are fluorescently tagged. This allows isolation of reporter-positive CTCs from the bloodstream. I will\nalso take advantage of clinical specimen, to provide the first comprehensive transcriptomic landscape of human melanoma CTCs. Using single-cell\nmulti-omics approaches, I will probe the extent of CTC heterogeneity, study their molecular properties and identify CTC markers for their\nidentification in the blood of mice and cancer patients. Subsequently, I will use a loss of function CRISPR-based approach to identify CTCs’\nvulnerabilities with the overarching aim to identify pharmacological strategies that halt early metastatic dissemination.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n21-03-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Cryoblocks of tumor tissue will be stored at -20°C, paraffin blocks of tumor\ntissue will be stored at room temperature. All human tissue samples will be registered with a Belgian biobank, in compliance with the Belgian\nlaw on human body material (dd 19-12-2008).\nOmics data: omics data generated during the project will either be stored on KU Leuven servers, in Mango or on The Flemish Supercomputer\nCentre (VSC), initially in the staging area and later in the archive area.\nVectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA\n(in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock (-80°C). All published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the non-profit\nplasmid repository Addgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request. \nCell lines: Newly created human cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid nitrogen storage and will be deposited in the UZ\nLeuven-KU Leuven Biobank. Other human cell lines will be stored locally in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory when actively used\nfor experiments. Animal cell lines will be stored in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory.\nBacterial and yeast strains will be stored in a -80°C freezer in the labs. Costs are covered by general lab expenses.\nGenetically modified organisms: Mice will be maintained in facilities of the Laboratory Animal Center of KU Leuven, which applies Standard\nOperation Procedures concerning housing, feeding, health monitoring to assure consistent care in accordance with European and national\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Sensitive data transfer will be performed according to the best practices for “Copying data to the secure environment” defined\nby KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of upgrades and security patches.\nThe server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound by the ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root\nrights. A security service monitors the technical installations continuously, even outside working hours. All private data will be rendered\nanonymous before processing outside the digital vault. Only the PI will be granted access to the server to deposit private data. The PI will be\nthe only responsible for linking patient information, survey data and/or tissue samples, and will strictly respect confidentiality. All de-identified\ndata will be exported from the database by the PI, and stored on KU Leuven servers from where it can be accessed by the research and\ntechnical staff from the laboratory.

When no experiment is\nplanned with a particular mouse strain, and in compliance with the 3R’s rule (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk), cryopreservation will thus be used to\nsafeguard the strain, prevent genetic drift, loss of transgene and potential infections or breeding problems. Cryopreservation of sperm/embryos\ncosts about 500 to 700 euro per genotype, plus a minimal annual storage fee (25 euro per strain for 250 to 500 embryos). Frozen specimens are\nkept in two separate liquid nitrogen tanks at two different sites on campus. When necessary, the costs of revitalization from cryopreserved\nsperm/embryos are about 1,100/600 euro.\nElectricity costs for the -80° freezers present in the labs are included in general lab costs.\nData storage and backup costs are included in general lab costs.\n4.

It relies on the early accumulation of driver mutations, and also on a combined set of signaling and nongenetic reprogramming events. Metastasis spreading requires tumur cells to enter the blood circulation, thus becoming Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs), to spread to distant/vital organs. This is critical step, in which tumor cells appear particularly vulnerable. A deeper understanding of the biology of CTC may help design strategies that eradicate metastasis. Little is known about CTCs in Melanoma, a highly metastatic disease. Herein I propose to develop methods for systematic detection and characterization of melanoma CTCs. I will use the Met-Track mouse model of metastatic melanoma, engineered by the host lab, in which all metastasis-initiating cells and their descendants are fluorescently tagged. This allows isolation of reporter-positive CTCs from the bloodstream. I will also take advantage of clinical specimen, to provide the first comprehensive transcriptomic landscape of human melanoma CTCs. Using single-cell multi-omics approaches, I will probe the extent of CTC heterogeneity, study their molecular properties and identify CTC markers for their identification in the blood of mice and cancer patients. Subsequently, I will use a loss of function CRISPR-based approach to identify CTCs’ vulnerabilities with the overarching aim to identify pharmacological strategies that halt early metastatic dissemination.

All animals will be registered in the Leuven Animal Information System (LAIS) database or ticket@lab, along with corresponding genotyping information, ethical approval documents and animal provider receipts. Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate. Algorithms, scripts and softwares: All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software code driving the project will be stored in a private online git repository in Gitlab Nucleic acid and protein sequences: All nucleic acid and protein sequences generated during the project will be stored on KU Leuven servers. Upon publication all sequences supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via repository such as the GenBank database or the European Nucleotide Archive (nucleotide sequences from primers / new genes / new genomes), NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (microarray data / RNA-seq data / CHIPseq data), the Protein Database (for protein sequences), the EBI European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) for personally identifiable (epi)genome and transcriptome sequences. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? KU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme: - data stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept. - data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept. - data stored on the digital vault is backed up using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. As standard, 10% of the requested storage is reserved for backups using the following backup regime: an hourly backup (at 8 a.m., 12 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.), the last 6 of which are kept; a daily backup (every day) at midnight, the last 6 of which are kept; and a weekly backup (every week) at midnight between Saturday and Sunday, the last 2 of which are kept. - All omics data stored on the Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC) and a backup is stored in Mango.

If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes There is sufficient storage and back-up capacity on all KU Leuven servers: - the “L-drive” is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster with NetApp eseries storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front-end. - the “J-drive” is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controlers with an Ontap 9.1P9 operating system. - the sequencing data is maintained on VSC storage and backed in Mango How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Both the “L-drive” and “J-drive” servers are accessible only by laboratory members, and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. Access to the digital vault is possible only through using a KU Leuven user-id and password, and user rights only grant access to the data in their own vault. Sensitive data transfer will be performed according to the best practices for “Copying data to the secure environment” defined by KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of upgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound by the ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. A security service monitors the technical installations continuously, even outside working hours. All private data will be rendered anonymous before processing outside the digital vault. Only the PI will be granted access to the server to deposit private data. The PI will be the only responsible for linking patient information, survey data and/or tissue samples, and will strictly respect confidentiality. All de-identified data will be exported from the database by the PI, and stored on KU Leuven servers from where it can be accessed by the research and technical staff from the laboratory. Data on VSC is only accessible by VSC username, password, and MFA, and permissions on data folders are set for specific groups in case of GDPR. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The total estimated cost of data storage during the project is 10,000 euro. This estimation is based on the following costs: -The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 114€/TB/Year for the “L-drive” and 519€/TB/Year for the “J-drive”, Mango 35€/Tb/year. - the Staging on VSC has been renewed in 2021 with 3 Pb of space; and the gbiomed NAS is scaleable and will start with 150 Tb space. Cloud Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 21 March 2024 8 of 11 storage is scalable. -Maintaining a mouse colony alive costs about 2,400 euro per year (for 12 cages), excluding the costs of genotyping. When no experiment is planned with a particular mouse strain, and in compliance with the 3R’s rule (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk), cryopreservation will thus be used to safeguard the strain, prevent genetic drift, loss of transgene and potential infections or breeding problems. Cryopreservation of sperm/embryos costs about 500 to 700 euro per genotype, plus a minimal annual storage fee (25 euro per strain for 250 to 500 embryos). Frozen specimens are kept in two separate liquid nitrogen tanks at two different sites on campus. When necessary, the costs of revitalization from cryopreserved sperm/embryos are about 1,100/600 euro. Electricity costs for the -80° freezers present in the labs are included in general lab costs. Data storage and backup costs are included in general lab costs. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project 4.
