The mismatch between multi-party proceedings and our procedural framework leads to legal uncertainty and may\ncontribute to longer court disposition times. The latter is especially problematic in view of Belgian court delay.\nProcedural change can tackle this problem. In the past, procedural change has been tested in view of reducing disposition times.\nHowever, speed cannot be the only goal of procedure: celerity sometimes conflicts with the right to a fair trial and the principle of party\nautonomy. This holds especially true in the context of multi-party proceedings.\nThis project aims to gather more in-depth and coherent knowledge on the position of multi-party proceedings in Belgian civil procedure.\nTheir current position will be profoundly studied in a doctrinal analysis, reinforced by semi-structured interviews with judges. It will then\nbe evaluated in light of the normative framework, using the principles of celerity, party autonomy and legal certainty, as well as the right to\na fair trial as criteria. The criteria will be operationalized through a comparison with the Netherlands and France, ensuring its relevance\nbeyond Belgium. Lastly, recommendations for scenarios with and without the possibility of legislative change will be formulated.\nID: \nID: \n213834\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-11-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n31-10-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n25-03-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
