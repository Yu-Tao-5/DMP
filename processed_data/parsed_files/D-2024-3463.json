Significant efforts have been made to develop DC-based therapies using donor-derived DCs. The use of\nautologous or allogenic DCs pulsed\nwith tumor lysates or tumor antigens represents a promising medical strategy for cancer treatment by boosting the priming of\nautologous tumor-specific T cells. However, several major drawbacks, including the high costs related to the time-consuming and labor-\nintensive manufacturing, the difficulty to use allogenic DCs and the sensitivity of DCs to tumor-derived immunosuppression are still\nhindering the potential of DCs-based therapies. To address these issues, I aim to generate a\nnovel artificial DC(aDC) that will mimic the T-cell priming of natural DCs but will be controllable, more efficient, and less expensive to\nproduce and handle. aDCs will incorporate a peptide:MHC I complex, costimulatory molecules, and a lipid-based vesicles “cytokine-\nreleasing” system. aDCs will be characterized via cryogenic electron-, scanning electron- and confocal microscopy. Their ability\nto activate T cells for tumor inhibition will be evaluated in vitro by a combination of functional assays and in vivo with mouse tumor\nmodels. Overall, these aDCs could allow to circumvent many limitations that hinder the potential of DC-based therapies and therefore\nrepresent a novel treatment strategy for cancer.\nID: \nID: \n212050\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-11-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n31-10-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n09-01-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

The KU Leuven (KUL) ICT service is responsible for the long-term storage server (K:Drive). The data is transferred to this drive after publication. All obtained data are saved on the KUL drive (J:Drive) and are accessible for the promotor of this project (Prof. Xavier Casadevall i Solvas) at all times. The MeBioS has implemented a data research management plan based on the general guidelines of the KUL, in accordance with FWO requirements, and has hired a dedicated data manager to take care of these actions. Also, remote access to J:Drive is possible through the KUL Box cloud and One Drive. We use SyncbackFree for backups in between One Drive and J:Drive folders. Created using DMPonline.be.
