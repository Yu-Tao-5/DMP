If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes We do not exclude that the proposed work could result in research data with potential for tech transfer- and valorization. VIB has a policy to actively monitor research data for such potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of cases the invention will be IP protected (mostly patent protection or copyright protection). As such the IP protection does not withhold the research data from being made public. In the case a decision is taken to file a patent application it will be planned so that publications need not be delayed.

Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook that refer to specific datasets. In addition, all related data will be stored, including data presented in congress, meetings, scientific events etc, manuscripts drafts and final versions.

Yes While specific data types might require particular metadata, as a general rule the metadata will be based on a generalized metadata schema such as Dublin Core or DataCite, including the following elements: • Title: free text • Creator: Last name, first name, organization • Date and time reference • Subject: Choice of keywords and classifications • Description: Text explaining the content of the data set and other contextual information needed for the Created using DMPonline.be.

For specific datasets, additional metadata will be associated with the data file as appropriate such as experimental procedures to generate transcriptomic data. The final dataset will be accompanied by this information under the form of a README.txt document. This file will be located in the top level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used. This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3.

How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Both the L-drive and J-drive servers are accessible only by laboratory members, and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. Access to the digital vault is possible only through using a KU Leuven user-id and password, and user rights only grant access to the data in their own vault. Sensitive data transfer will be performed according to the best practices for “Copying data to the secure environment” defined by KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of upgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound by the ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. A security service monitors the technical installations continuously, even outside working hours. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Each year €738 will be charged from our ICT service for the use of 5 TB on the L-drive (long term storage). Back-up service is included in the price. These costs are included in the lab budget.
