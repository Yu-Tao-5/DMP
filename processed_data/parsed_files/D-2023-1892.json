For these\nkitchen secrets, called ‘trade secrets’ in legal jargon, intellectual property protection is often\nimpossible or inappropriate. In order to be able to invoke this intellectual property protection, the\ninformation must be made public and over time the competitive advantage is lost. However, trade\nsecrets also leave the internal kitchen of the company when employees start their own business or\njoin another company. This tension between trade secret protection and the freedom to conduct a\nbusiness is at the heart of the proposed research: after all, the trade secret regime can stop this\ninformation flow, but only if the necessary conditions are met. However, those conditions are vaguely\ndefined, making it difficult to determine whether they are met, and current doctrine offers little\nclarification. This research therefore examines (1) which safeguards for the balance between trade\nsecret protection and the freedom to conduct a business the trade secret regime (as it is currently\ninterpreted) provides, (2) how these safeguards and their interpretation can be explained, (3) to\nwhat extent the current Belgian safeguards create a balance between trade secret protection and the\nfreedom to conduct a business and (4) in which way this balance can be improved.\nLast modified: \n05-04-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
