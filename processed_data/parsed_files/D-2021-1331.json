That means that these materials cannot be shared with other researchers. All the data without copyright restriction will be available. Which data will be made available after the end of the project? At the end of the project the data will be uploaded in Zenodo. The researcher will only make publicly available those that do not involve copyright, that have not required a declaration of non-dissemination. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? In a restricted access repository At the end of the project all data will be uploaded in Zenodo, but only part of them will be made publicly available, depending on copyright restrictions. When will the data be made available? Immediately after the end of the project In sharing data, potential copyright restricions will be taken into account. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? The full dataset will be uploaded in Zenodo, but only part of it will be accessible to third parties. Regarding the part available there will be not restrictions. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered? Zenodo is a free platform. No costs will be involved. 8.
