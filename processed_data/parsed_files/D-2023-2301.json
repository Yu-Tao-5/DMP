In the non-\ndissipative ground state of a superconductor  electrons combine in so-called Cooper pairs, i.e. two electrons \nwith opposite spin orientation allowing the maximization of their phonon -mediated attraction. Unfortunately,  \nthis compensated spin configuration is not beneficial for s pin information propagation in superconductors.  \nHowever, at finite temperatures elementary excitations (quasiparticles) behaving as chargeless fermions  \nenable  efficient  transmission  of  pure  spin  information  with  extremely  long  lifetimes.  Interfacing  the \nsuperconductor with a ferromagnetic material permits  the transformation of spin-singlet (S=0, no spin  \ntransport possible) into spin-triplet (S=1, possible spin transport) pairs and the creation of a spin-triplet  \nlossless supercurrent. Thus far, most  investigations  have  addressed the spin transport  in conventional  \nsuperconductor/ferromagnet hybrids.  In this research project, the KUL and ULg team will tackle a variety of  \nvery interesting questions regarding the origin and lifetime of the spin carriers and how one can achieve  \nefficient spin pumping using a variety of novel superconducting and ferromagnetic hybrid devices. More \nprecisely, we will focus on complex oxides that exhibit unique advantages including epitaxial stacking and  \nconsequently  high  transparency  for  spin  transport,  a  high  superconducting  critical  temperature  \ntechnologically attractive for potential operational devices, and a wealth of unconventional coupled electronic  \nand structural phases.

If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: As mentioned in the previous point 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data.☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☐ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☒ Other: data obtained at international research infrastructures are also stored at the facility (and remain available for online access) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? ☐ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back-ups I make (specify) ☒ Other (specify) All experimental data will be stored on the Network drives provided on site at the department (smb or nfs protocol), the system consists of two backup systems. The drive is backed up daily, and deleted folders/files can be recovered up to 64 snapshots. Secondly, this is with a 30-day retention policy, which means we can restore deleted or previous versions of our files up to 30 days in the past. This backup is physically on another server to prevent data loss in case of hardware failures of the main fileserver. The documentation mentioned in point 3 is also stored on our Network drive, moreover locally on my department laptop and personal hard drive (weekly). Data obtained at international research infrastructures are stored and backed up at that facility on large storage devices. Physical samples are placed in sample boxes and labelled as described in the overview dataset. The volatile samples will be kept secure in our available vacuum pots (capacity of around 800 samples, present in our lab), while the robust samples are stored under ambient conditions in my personal office space. However, the storage of fabricated samples is not always as useful as conceived. Some samples degrade over time or are destroyed purely by the removal process inherent to our cryostats. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If no, please specify: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data To gain access to the network drives, one need to go through a process initiated by our ICT responsible and be KULeuven/physics associated. The only way to access is through our personal department laptop or lab desktop. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?No additional resources are needed, covered by our department/KULeuven. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☒ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?No additional resources are needed, covered by our department/KULeuven, personal. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☐ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☐ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☒ Other, please specify: Data used in a publication will not be placed online in a repository, but is stored on our network drives accessible by all our team members. The data that support the plots of our papers and other findings within our studies are available upon reasonable request. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Not applicable, data is accessible upon reasonable request. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Other data repository (specify) ☒ Other (specify) See description above. When will the data be made available? ☐ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☒ Other (specify) See description above. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 14Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. Check the RDR guidance on licences for data and software sources code or consult the License selector tool to help you choose. ☐ CC-BY 4.0 (data) ☐ Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) ☐ MIT licence (code) ☐ GNU GPL-3.0 (code) ☒ Other (specify) no reuse of data. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☒ No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? No costs 7.
