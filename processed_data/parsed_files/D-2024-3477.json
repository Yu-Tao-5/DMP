Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate.\nYes\nThis project already received personal data processing approval from the GDPR-unit in KU Leuven with application number G-2024-8859.\nIn short, we only collect essential personal data of the pupil (name, gender, age), of the class (study program, study year) and of the school (which school group), together with student reponses to mathematical\ntesting instruments and control instruments (for example socio-economic status). Before participation, parents have the time to go through all information in an informed consent and pupils themselves also\nhave the option to opt out at any stage in the research process. All personal data is pseudonymized immediately after collection, and the pseudonymization keys are stored separately and only kept for the\nminimally needed time.\n \nDoes your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)?

If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nYes\nAs \"open-source\" is one of this project's spearheads, the created testing instruments (O2materials) and the created educational intervention online modules (O3materials) will be released publicly and easily\ncopy-able. This means anyone in the world (for example researchers wanting to test the same skills or textbook authors in proving) are allowed to build on the produced materials, including commercialisation\n(for example selling derived textbooks to students). We are purposely allowing commercial derived works, to increase the impact of our research project on everyday practice (which is mainly guided by\ntextbooks from commercial publishers).\nCommercial valorization of the datasets containing student answers is neither appropriate nor wanted.\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements/ research collaboration agreements)?

Yes, human subject data This project already received ethics approval from the SMEC committee with application number G-2024-8859. This project is in the area of mathematics educational research, and thus needs to collect educationally relevant data from pupils in order to investigate teaching effectiveness. Participants are informed in full in advance, their experience during participation is almost indistinguishable from ordinary mathematics lessons (filling in a test or completing an online learning module) + parental consent is required in advance. Will you process personal data? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. Will you process personal data? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. Yes This project already received personal data processing approval from the GDPR-unit in KU Leuven with application number G-2024-8859. In short, we only collect essential personal data of the pupil (name, gender, age), of the class (study program, study year) and of the school (which school group), together with student reponses to mathematical testing instruments and control instruments (for example socio-economic status). Before participation, parents have the time to go through all information in an informed consent and pupils themselves also have the option to opt out at any stage in the research process. All personal data is pseudonymized immediately after collection, and the pseudonymization keys are stored separately and only kept for the minimally needed time. Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes As \"open-source\" is one of this project's spearheads, the created testing instruments (O2materials) and the created educational intervention online modules (O3materials) will be released publicly and easily copy-able. This means anyone in the world (for example researchers wanting to test the same skills or textbook authors in proving) are allowed to build on the produced materials, including commercialisation (for example selling derived textbooks to students). We are purposely allowing commercial derived works, to increase the impact of our research project on everyday practice (which is mainly guided by textbooks from commercial publishers). Commercial valorization of the datasets containing student answers is neither appropriate nor wanted.

Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Total physical data is less than 3000 pages, which can fit in the mentioned closet. Digital data in total (across all platforms) is limited to 250 GB, most of which comes from video materials which will be stored on the Shared KU Leuven drive of the research group. Other online platforms (ANS, Pavlovia, Gitlab, ...) either do not have exact data limits (as typical usage is less than 10 Mb's) or the expected data size is covered by an existing KU Leuven agreement. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? To summarize the table before: physical data is stored in a locked closet within the researcher's personal, locked office. Digital data is stored on KU Leuven server's or on reliable platforms the university has existing agreements with. All authentication happens through KU Leuven's central login. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? See the overview before. Expected costs are well below the available FWO credit for yearly research expenses (on the scale of 150 euro per year). Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 27 March 2025 10 of 12 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Wherever possible, data will be retained for at least five years. Exceptions are the created videos for the interviews, as these are hard to pseudonimyze and will be converted into written transcriptions (which will be kept). Also the field notes provide little relevant information for later re-use and will thus not be stored long-term. And lastly, the dataset of interactions in the online learning platform (during development, so O3 is of little use to other researchers) The binding key (connecting pseudo-ids and identifying information) will be stored only for limited time and then securely destroyed. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Physical data will be archived in the research group archives for at least 5 years. Digital data will be archived (and shared, see later) on the Zenodo platform. Source code will be made public on the Gitlab from KU Leuven. The designed educational resources will be deposited in oercommons.org and (flemish database of such resource) \"Klascement\". For integration with the FWO's automatic checks on publications, we will also register a record in Lirias (without the data itself) to afford integration with the FRIS research portal. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? None. 5. Data sharing and reuse 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in an Open Access repository Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) All data with re-use value will be shared (see the exceptions in the data retention section). The testing materials used will be shared in a restricted access repository, to prevent students from preparing their assessment in advance. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Access is only restricted to the used testing instruments.
