Certainly, the volume of OI research and its impact on practice\nhas been remarkable. However, equally remarkable is the lack of balance. With few exceptions, the stories of OI are\npositive stories. The focus on successes leads to open innovation imperatives and the conclusion that, where ‘openness’\nfalls below some optimum, as is frequently the case, there is (market) failure. Despite suggestions of eventual\ndiminishing returns, the common conclusion of most scholarly articles is that for most firms, openness is good and more\nopenness is better.\nIn this research project, we will nuance this perception by empirically investigating the relationships between innovation\nopenness and its effects on project abandonment, IP litigation risk, as well as (unintended) knowledge leakage and\neventual product imitation. Using unique (survey) data from Belgium and Germany we will investigate multiple modes of\nOI and their impact on the aforementioned dangers and risks firms are facing in their (open) innovation strategy\nimplementation.\nThese pitfalls of OI will lead to both managerial and policy implications. Managers will find it useful to review their IP\nstrategies carefully and to re-inforce a careful project management control, and policy makers may re-consider their\ncollaborative R&D and innovation-cluster policies.\nLast modified: \n03-07-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
