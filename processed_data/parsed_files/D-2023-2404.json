Detection of early warning signs of\ndepression is therefore of great importance, as it allows for timely intervention. Statistical process control (SPC) has recently been introduced in\npsychopathology, to monitor a person’s affective experiences in real-time and signal when meaningful changes in mood occur. While initial studies\nshow the potential of SPC in early detection of depression, several challenges currently limit its usability in practice. This project aims to address these\nchallenges in the following ways.
