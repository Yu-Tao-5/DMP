Data storage and Backup during Research\nHow and where will the data be stored during research?\nCentrally on storage facilities of the research unit\nWhich back-up procedures are in place?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic daily back-up\nprocedures\nDescribe the data security procedures and who has access to the data.\nThe researchers involved have access to the data.\nData generated internally by CD3/Cistim are stored in a dedicated project folder on an internal\nserver, maintained and secured by KU Leuven ICTS. Access to the data is limited to Cistim\nemployees. Next to this, chemical structures and activity data of compounds are uploaded into\nthe Dotmatics repository hosted on an internal KU Leuven maintained server following\nstandardized procedures. Access to Dotmatics is also limited to internal users. Scientists at\nCistim are trained on data security processes. Data can only be stored on the central server or\ndotmatics and not on PC’s or non-secured data carriers. Compound structures are never shared\nvia email or other none secured data carriers.

In most cases a master service agreement is or will be\nestablished and if not, terms and conditions will be negotiated with support of KU Leuven LRD to\nprotect data and IP. In any case all shared data, analysis results, analytical reports and products\nwill remain our sole property. Through the contract the CRO is also obliged to prepare adequate,\naccurate and secured records of their work done in the performance of the services. They are\nalso required to report all data, information, discoveries, observations and the like. If needed, a\nrepresentative is allowed to inspect the CRO’s facility to audit correct execution of the contract.\nThe contracts will also contain agreements regarding data retention and destruction by the CRO\nwhen all services are finished. \nData generated by LBDM (Voet lab) is stored in a double backed-up NAS of 64TB with 4TB\nreserved for this project.\nData generated by Laboratory for Molecular Biodiscovery is stored in lab books and on local\ncomputers which are kept in the laboratory and only accessible by approved personnel with a\nbadge.

For\ninstance all data on compound activity will be shared with all members of the consortium but\nchemical structures will only be shared when this is required.\nData sharing with CROs is also limited and tightly monitored. When approaching a CRO an NDA\nwill be established with support of KU Leuven LRD before confidential data are shared.\nSubsequently, data sharing during the services by the CRO will be described in a contract as\ndescribed above.\n There will be restrictions for data disclosure outside of the consortium as it may contain IP-\nsensitive information.
