The F WO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.  \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.  \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation  Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders \nand research institutions.  This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary  of definitions and abbreviatio ns is \navailable via the following link.  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        2 \n 1.

T cell redirecting strategies such  as bispecific antibodies (bsAb) are  a new and important therapy \nfor those patients. T cell redirecting strategies used in MM target  B cell maturat ion antigen (BCMA)  and the \norphan receptor GPRC5D amongst others . Despite their impressive therapeutic efficacy,  there is still an  \nimportant knowledge gap regarding predictive factors for response and adverse  events such as cytokine \nrelease syndrome (CRS) and infections, and optimal preventive measures during treatment with bsAb. \nDifferences in the  stromal bone marrow environment and circulating immune repertoire are thought to be \nresponsible for variation between patients.  In this research project we will perform detailed immune analysis \nin blood  from RR MM patients who are  treated with bsAb  and after VZV vaccination  to identify the most \nimportant factors that are contributing to vaccine  response , bsAb response , CRS and infections. In-depth \nserological analysis and a dvanced immune profiling by flow cytometry will be performed on blood at regular \nintervals. In selected patients, the relationship with the stromal cells will be investigated using multi -iterated \nimmunohistochemistry , spatial tran scriptomic  analysis  and 3 -D confocal microscopy will be done on bone \nbiopsies. In addition to the micro environment, we will also explore novel mechanisms of resistance by  \nstudying the downstream signalling  pathway of BCMA  and GPRC5D . In particular we will analyse gene \nmutations and  altered gene and protein expression  of BCMA and attempt to identify the binding partners of \nGPRC5D . These pathways will be modulated and bsAb tested in co -culture experiments and in -vivo \nexperiments with immunodeficient mice.  We believe  that this project will create novel insights in the  \nmechanisms contributing to response and resistance  of bsAb and therefore can contribute  to a more optimal \nuse of these drugs in RR MM.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        4 \n 2.

    "clean_full_text": "FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 1 FWO DMP Template - Flemish Standard Data Management Plan Version KU Leuven Project supervisors (from application round 2018 onwards) and fellows (from application round 2020 onwards) will, upon being awarded their project or fellowship, be invited to develop their answers to the data management related questions into a DMP. The F WO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviatio ns is available via the following link.

FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 3 Please provide a short project description Patients with relapsed refractory (RR) multiple myeloma (MM) have an unmet need for better treatment strategies. T cell redirecting strategies such as bispecific antibodies (bsAb) are a new and important therapy for those patients. T cell redirecting strategies used in MM target B cell maturat ion antigen (BCMA) and the orphan receptor GPRC5D amongst others . Despite their impressive therapeutic efficacy, there is still an important knowledge gap regarding predictive factors for response and adverse events such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and infections, and optimal preventive measures during treatment with bsAb. Differences in the stromal bone marrow environment and circulating immune repertoire are thought to be responsible for variation between patients. In this research project we will perform detailed immune analysis in blood from RR MM patients who are treated with bsAb and after VZV vaccination to identify the most important factors that are contributing to vaccine response , bsAb response , CRS and infections. In-depth serological analysis and a dvanced immune profiling by flow cytometry will be performed on blood at regular intervals. In selected patients, the relationship with the stromal cells will be investigated using multi -iterated immunohistochemistry , spatial tran scriptomic analysis and 3 -D confocal microscopy will be done on bone biopsies. In addition to the micro environment, we will also explore novel mechanisms of resistance by studying the downstream signalling pathway of BCMA and GPRC5D . In particular we will analyse gene mutations and altered gene and protein expression of BCMA and attempt to identify the binding partners of GPRC5D . These pathways will be modulated and bsAb tested in co -culture experiments and in -vivo experiments with immunodeficient mice. We believe that this project will create novel insights in the mechanisms contributing to response and resistance of bsAb and therefore can contribute to a more optimal use of these drugs in RR MM.
