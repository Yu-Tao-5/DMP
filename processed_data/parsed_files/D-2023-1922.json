ResMacs originate from \nembryonic progenitors and mainly self-maintain within tissues but may be replaced by monocyte-derived \nmacrophages following depletion or inflammation. The function of ResMacs is tissue-dependent and their \nphenotype is largely determined by cues and signals from surrounding cells, a concept known as the \nmacrophage niche. Diverse ResMacs are located in distinct layers of the intestine including close to \n(sub)mucosal blood vessels (BVA-ResMacs). We have collected preliminary evidence that BVA-ResMacs \nare involved in limiting bacterial translocation to the portal circulation. Furthermore, following bacterial \ninfection, BVA-ResMacs are replaced by monocytes (BVAinfResMacs). I hypothesize that BVA-ResMacs are \ncrucial for the integrity of the gut-vascular barrier and that upon inflammation, these cells are replaced \nBVA-infResMacs with a distinct, protective phenotype improving the gut-vascular barrier during a \nsubsequent inflammatory event. To unravel the underlying mechanism, I will investigate and compare the \nfunction, transcriptome and the niche of embryonic BVA-ResMacs and their inflammatory counterparts, \nBVA-infResMacs. The outcome of this project will provide crucial insights in the role of BVA-(inf)ResMacs \nin intestinal vascular integrity and inflammation, and lead to the identification of novel targets to treat \nimmune-mediated diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 84.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Data will be stored on servers centrally managed by ICTS KU Leuven and with back-up capacities (KU Leuven enterprise box, Largevolume-storage). The scRNAseq data are stored by the lab of Prof. Thierry Voet at the VSC (Flemish Supercomputer Centre) and the server of UZ Leuven. Physical (tissue) samples will be stored at -20 or -80°C in freezers purchased by the PIs. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.We will use the back-up facilities of the KU Leuven ICTS with automatic daily back-up procedures. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: So far, there is enough storage room. If the capacity foreseen by KU Leuven is exceeded, extra storage capacity will be requested at the ICT department of KU Leuven. Expected maximum volume: 5 TB. If needed, extra freezers will be purchased. If no, please specify: 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7Data files are stored on the J drive of KU Leuven which is protected via a central login for KUL personnel. In case data are stored on managed laptops, the hard drive is encrypted. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?The estimated amount of data (scRNAseq data excluded) can be stored on the K drive, KU Leuven ICTS. If needed, an upgrade will be requested at 156,60 euro/TB/year. The expected maximum data volume of 5 TB will cost a total of 4000€ for 5 years (5 x160 euro/yr x 5 years). The costs will be paid from the current project. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All data will be retained during 5 years following the end of the project. This includes all physical and non physical data. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?Server of KU Leuven (see above) Data will be archived after 5 years on the K drive of KU Leuven devoted for longterm storage. Permission to access the K drive is limited to the PI and only for read-only use. Archived data may no longer be modified. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?The estimated amount of data (scRNAseq data excluded) can be stored on the K drive, KU Leuven ICTS. If needed, an upgrade will be requested at 156,60 euro/TB/year. The expected maximum data volume of 5 TB will cost a total of 4000€ for 5 years (5 x160 euro/yr x 5 years). The costs will be paid from the current project. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 116. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☐ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Data will be shared within the research unit. Data under IP will not be shared with peers. Sequencing data will be uploaded in an open access repository and shared upon request. The data will be protected by creative commons. Data without sharing restrictions will be shared through peer reviewed publications. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.The data will be made available after publication via the required link in the publication or upon request. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.Upon publication of the research results The data will be made available after publications via the required link in the publication or upon request Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 The data will be made available after publications via the required link in the publication or upon request. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes: What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Peers can use the data at no cost under the condition of co-authorship. Commercial organizations will have to pay a fee that will be determined by LRD-KU Leuven. 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 137.
