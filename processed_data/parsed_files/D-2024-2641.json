Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). At PSI as well as at CERN ISOLDE, a digital logbook is kept for the preparation of the experiment and the experiment itself, to note down important information that may be needed during the offline analysis. This will include information regarding the setup (type and unique code of detectors used, other electronics used ...), the parameters used (voltages, filters, ...), and details for every collection (time of start/stop, isotope, beam current, proton current, foil used, ...). Every person involved in the experiment will have access to it through personal credentials. Moreover, for the Reference Raddi experiments, the experimental conditions are saved for each run in an equipment.json file. Additionally, an analysis logbook will be created to keep track of the progress and of the procedures used during the offline analysis. Only people involved in the analysis will have access to this. At CERN, TIMBER is used to store all parameters related to the experimental setup (eg. magnetic fields). For the target production of the stable Ag, the specifications are kept in a .pdf file. Moreover an overview sheet will be made including all targets owned by the ReferenceRadii and their current location. For the 110mAg test target, the production information at PSI will be documented. For the 108mAg target, the production procedure at MARIA or BR2 will be documented. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data?

Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? The PSI data is stored on the PSI DAQ PC, as well as backed up via DORA-PSI. Moreover, the raw, secondary and tertiary data are stored on the KU Leuven cluster that is accessible to every member of the research group (in read-only mode). The ISOLDE data is stored on the DFS (data file server). Everything produced in the offline analysis will be kept on this same KU Leuven cluster. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? The KU Leuven cluster features a multi-location back up, so all raw data and metadata will be stored and backed up automatically every week Created using DMPonline.be.

How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The access to the KU Leuven cluster repository of the research group is limited and the original data is in read-only mode, so that nobody can, even unintentionally, modify the raw data.

In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). institutional policies...). The raw output data of the ReferenceRadii experiments as well as the output trees. The stable silver targets will be kept. The results from the self-sputtering simulations will be kept as txt files as well as the input files used to generate these results. However, 108mAg and 110mAg are radioactive and can therefore not be kept in a stable status (110mAg after 5 years: 100kBq -> 0.6366kBq; 108mAg after 5 years: 1MBq -> 0.9919MBq). Hence, the information regarding the production procedure will be kept as the sources themselves cannot be kept in spite of the best practices. In that sense, the 110mAg separated source will be left at CERN so that other experiments can benefit from its ideal calibration properties. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? The data will be stored on the IKS servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.
