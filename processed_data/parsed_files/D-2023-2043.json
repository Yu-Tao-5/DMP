To fill this gap, the topical application of probiotic Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) has been explored to combat\nwound infections. While both in vitro and in vivo data underpin the potential of this strategy, there is still considerable room for\nimprovement. Therefore, this project aims to investigate whether experimental evolution can be used to tailor LAB for their application in\nwound care by enhancing their antimicrobial and anti-virulence properties against wound-associated pathogens. First, this project aims to\ndeliver in vitro proof-of-concept by designing innovative setups for experimental evolution to improve various probiotic traits of LAB,\nincluding their competitive strength against wound-associated pathogens, their collagen-binding properties, their quorum quenching\ncapacity and their co-aggregation with target pathogens. The most promising probiotics that emerge from these evolution experiments will\nbe phenotypically and genotypically characterized and validated in an in vivo porcine wound infection model. If successful, this project will\nnot only contribute to a significant advancement in the domain of wound care, but also provide a more general framework for enhancing\nthe efficacy of probiotics as an antimicrobial strategy.\nLast modified: \n07-03-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

This digital notebook organises all data acquired within a project in a standardized manner\nand attaches a fixed set of metadata (see below). In addition, separate folders are created for the raw, processed, and final data. \nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data?

Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nThe data will be stored on the hard drive of my laptop, as well as on the SharePoint-based electronic lab notebook (ELN). The ELN is an application hosted on-site within KU Leuven (meaning it is\nnot a cloud storage). Large data files such as microscopy images and whole genome sequencing files will be stored on the internal server of KU Leuven and linked to the ELN. \nHow will the data be backed up?\nThe ELN and the internal KU Leuven server contain an automatic back-up for the drive capacity that is in use:\nA back-up every few hours (at 9h, 12h30, and 17h), of which the latest 7 versions are saved\nA daily back-up (at 21h), of which the latest 10 version are saved\nA weekly back-up (Sunday at 11h), of which the latest 6 version are saved\nIn addition to these daily and weekly backups on the internal KU Leuven servers, a regular backup on an external drive will be made to protect against the unlikely scenario in which the KU\nLeuven servers malfunction.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nKU Leuven provides easily expandable storage space based on their internal server maintained by the IT service of KU Leuven. Our lab uses two drives on the KU Leuven internal server: the J-\ndrive, and the K-drive. The J-driver is intended for daily use, while the K-drive mainly serves as a long-term storage space.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nAccess to the ELN only works via KU Leuven Single Sign On\nEach user should have a valid KU Leuven intranet user ID and password\nPermission for access can be defined in detail by the local admin of the SharePoint site.\nBiological samples will be stored in a secured -80°C freezer at the facility.\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
