Specifically, it gives an  \noverview of the data that will be collected during the project through the work packages  \n(WPs) and tasks, and clarifies how these will be collected, stored, and used. This DMP is a  \ndynamic document that will be adapted, refined, and updated throughout the course of the  \nproject, as the exact outputs of each WP, and thus the data management requirements,  \nbecome clearer. Final revisions to the DMP will be incorporated into the final version of the  \nproject report and submitted to the FWO at the end of the project.\nBio+W aims to make all data available, aside from any GDPR-sensitive data (which is not  \nexpected) and data  obtained within the confines of a confidentiality agreement (which is also  \nnot anticipated). All Research Data is managed via this detailed Data Management Plan  \n(DMP) and its rolling updates, to ensure that data collected throughout the project, and  \nunderpinning the publications, can be accessed (and therefore the results reproduced) and  \nthat the data/research outputs are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR )1.\n1 Mark D.

Using the principles of bioreceptive  \ndesign, which is a building engineering science focussed on the texturing, and patterning of  \nbase material surfaces, details on the wood surface form microniches with affordances for  \nbiological succession where (mixed) biofilms, and rootless plants (e.g. mosses and lichens)  \nultimately, give way to higher plants.  Bio+W differs from current state-of-the art as  current \ninterest in bioreceptive surfaces centres on reducing the environmental impact of concrete.  \nThe project aims to develop optimized surface topologies, which enable a range of plants and  \norganisms to be nurtured through the strategic direction of water and air flow.  \nBioreceptive performance in Bio+W is evaluated through the fidelity of plant growth patterns  \nbased on quantitative measurements and in vitro experiments with respect to change in  \nmass  (reflecting  water  and  biomass  content),  relative  humidity,  temperature,  and  \npercentage cover at scheduled time intervals. The integrity of the panels is also tested at the  \nend of the experiments through static bending and hardness tests.  \nBio+W  is  a  foundational  system  for  next-generation  sustainable  design,  which  on  \nimplementation, enables buildings to benefit from attractive sustainable wooden facades  \nwith similar the benefits as low maintenance green walls that increase biodiversity, reduce  \nheat island effects, provide sound insulation, and reduce air pollution.\n5\nBio+W                                                                                                                   Data Management Plan V1\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU LeuvenDocument Summary\nProject supervisors (from application round 2018 onwards) and fellows (from application  \nround 2020 onwards) will, upon being awarded their project or fellowship, be invited to  \ndevelop their answers to the data management related questions into a DMP. The FWO  \nexpects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project \nor fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination  \noffice of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.  \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  must be added to the final report of  \nthe  project;  this  should  be  submitted  to  FWO  by  the  supervisor-spokesperson  through  \nFWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is  \nan element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP  \nsubmitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this  \ntemplate.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the  \nFlemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by  \nthe  Flemish  Research  Data  Network  (FRDN)  Task  Force  DMP  which  comprises  \nrepresentatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP  \ntemplate based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data  \nmanagement planning. \nTo increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link. \n6\nBio+W                                                                                                                   Data Management Plan V1\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU LeuvenGeneral Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Rachel Armstrong, ORCID: 0000-0002-3516-6815\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Veerle Van der Sluys, ORCID: 0000-0002-204204068  \nProject number 2 & title G048424N– BioReceptive Wood (Bio+W)\nFunder(s) GrantID 3G048424N\nAffiliation(s) KU Leuven \nROR identifier KU Leuven: 05f950310\nPlease provide a short project description Bio+W is a foundational system for next-generation sustainable design, which on implementation, enables  \nbuildings  to  benefit  from  attractive  sustainable  wooden  facades  with  similar  the  benefits  as  low  \nmaintenance green walls that increase biodiversity, reduce heat island effects, provide sound insulation,  \nand reduce air pollution.\n2 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

Other project outputs e.g., video, \nanimations, public information are hosted on the project website, the Research Catalogue (www.researchcatalogue.net) and YouTube.  \nAfter any IP concerns have been addressed (non-GDPR sensitive and unbound by confidentiality agreements) , datasets will be publicly available, and will be  \ngiven DOI and made publicly available, being deposited  in online trusted repositories such as Zenodo, with programming code (e.g. for novel patterns)  \ndeposited in GitHub and/or GitLab. Zenodo automatically assigns a persistent identifier (DOI) to all inputs, and the GitHub and GitLab repositories will be  \nlinked within the appropriate Zenodo repositories. KUL’s institutional repository RDR (https://rdr.kuleuven.be) will be used to ensure that all data has a DOI  \nand metadata can be added so it is findable.

All datasets will be exclusively in digital formats and will be created throughout the  \nproject as the result of experimental studies. These digital datasets will be stored in a variety of formats and will have volumes ranging from less than 1GB to  \ngreater than 50TB. \nThe data and knowledge produced through this project will provide guidance for the incorporation of surface patterns into different kinds of woods to generate  \nwooden panels with bioreceptive and aesthetic properties. Building on the natural properties of wood, Bio+C intensifies natural processes, which are enhanced  \nby the bioreceptive design making them accessible to further colonisation by organisms, to increase biodiversity, perform ecosystem services and offer an  \nattractive aesthetic appearance for installation within site-specific contexts. \nAll data generated  and/or collected through the project that can be made publicly available ( i.e., non-GDPR sensitive data and unbound to confidentiality  \nagreements) will be deposited online in a trusted repository . The main repositories that will be used are Zenodo for the general content and GitHub and  \nGitLab for programming code ( e.g., written in R). Data entered in GitHub/GitLab will be linked to Zenodo. All open access data in the repositories will by  \nlicensed through CC-BY, CC-0, or an equivalent license. Publications generated using project data will be deposited in a trusted repository at the time of  \npublication. All information required for the understanding, reuse, or repurposing of the data will be attached to the data, and all information necessary to  \nrepeat, recreate, and validate the results will accompany the publications. In the repository, immediate open access will be provided. When reports or scientific  \npapers are written using processed, pseudonymized, and/or anonymized data, open access will be granted through a trusted repository. Data containing  \nGDPR-sensitive information and data obtained through confidentiality agreements will not be made publicly available, but these datasets will be deposited in  \na trusted data repository, with a DOI, metadata, and access restrictions in a repository like Zenodo or RDR.  \nThe data will be stored in open non-proprietary formats such as (JPEG/PNG/TIFF, PDF, PSD, MP4, txt, etc.). If proprietary formats are used internally, a usable  \ncopy will be available in one of the recommended open formats.  All outputs or processed data produced through the project workflow that are neither  \nconfidential nor GDPR sensitive will be made publicly available as licensed under CC-BY or an equivalent/comparable license, with metadata licensed under  \nCC-0, as is automatically done when using Zenodo. Data deposited in Zenodo will always be described with metadata and is compliant with DataCite, a leading  \nglobal non-profit organization that provides persistent identifiers (specifically DOIs) for research data and other research outputs . All relevant materials will be  \ndirected to DataCite servers during DOI registration and indexed therein. Zenodo automatically catalogues the metadata, with relevant statistics reported,  \nsuch that the data and metadata can be seamlessly harvested through the platform.\n11\nBio+W                                                                                                                   Data Management Plan V1\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU LeuvenClearly describe what approach will be followed  \nto  capture  the  accompanying  information  \nnecessary  to  keep  data  understandable  and  \nusable, for yourself and others, now and in the  \nfuture (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and  \ntypes required, procedures used, Electronic Lab  \nNotebooks,  README.txt  files,  Codebook.tsv  \netc. where this information is recorded).\nRDM guidance on documentation and metadata .Protocols \nAll data will be made available  collected throughout the project so it can be accessed (and therefore  \nthe results reproduced).

Specifically, it gives an overview of the data that will be collected during the project through the work packages (WPs) and tasks, and clarifies how these will be collected, stored, and used. This DMP is a dynamic document that will be adapted, refined, and updated throughout the course of the project, as the exact outputs of each WP, and thus the data management requirements, become clearer. Final revisions to the DMP will be incorporated into the final version of the project report and submitted to the FWO at the end of the project. Bio+W aims to make all data available, aside from any GDPR-sensitive data (which is not expected) and data obtained within the confines of a confidentiality agreement (which is also not anticipated). All Research Data is managed via this detailed Data Management Plan (DMP) and its rolling updates, to ensure that data collected throughout the project, and underpinning the publications, can be accessed (and therefore the results reproduced) and that the data/research outputs are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR )1. 1 Mark D. Wilkinson; Michel Dumontier; IJsbrand Jan Aalbersberg; et al. (15 March 2016). \"The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship\" . Scientific Data. 3 (1): 160018. doi:10.1038/SDATA.2016.18 4 Bio+W Data Management Plan V1 FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU LeuvenProject Summary \"Bioreceptive Wood” (Bio+W) explores enlivening building surfaces through the structured patterning of sustainably sourced, untreated wood. Using the principles of bioreceptive design, which is a building engineering science focussed on the texturing, and patterning of base material surfaces, details on the wood surface form microniches with affordances for biological succession where (mixed) biofilms, and rootless plants (e.g. mosses and lichens) ultimately, give way to higher plants. Bio+W differs from current state-of-the art as current interest in bioreceptive surfaces centres on reducing the environmental impact of concrete. The project aims to develop optimized surface topologies, which enable a range of plants and organisms to be nurtured through the strategic direction of water and air flow. Bioreceptive performance in Bio+W is evaluated through the fidelity of plant growth patterns based on quantitative measurements and in vitro experiments with respect to change in mass (reflecting water and biomass content), relative humidity, temperature, and percentage cover at scheduled time intervals. The integrity of the panels is also tested at the end of the experiments through static bending and hardness tests. Bio+W is a foundational system for next-generation sustainable design, which on implementation, enables buildings to benefit from attractive sustainable wooden facades with similar the benefits as low maintenance green walls that increase biodiversity, reduce heat island effects, provide sound insulation, and reduce air pollution. 5 Bio+W Data Management Plan V1 FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU LeuvenDocument Summary Project supervisors (from application round 2018 onwards) and fellows (from application round 2020 onwards) will, upon being awarded their project or fellowship, be invited to develop their answers to the data management related questions into a DMP. The FWO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP must be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link. 6 Bio+W Data Management Plan V1 FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU LeuvenGeneral Project Information Name Grant Holder & ORCID Rachel Armstrong, ORCID: 0000-0002-3516-6815 Contributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Veerle Van der Sluys, ORCID: 0000-0002-204204068 Project number 2 & title G048424N– BioReceptive Wood (Bio+W) Funder(s) GrantID 3G048424N Affiliation(s) KU Leuven ROR identifier KU Leuven: 05f950310 Please provide a short project description Bio+W is a foundational system for next-generation sustainable design, which on implementation, enables buildings to benefit from attractive sustainable wooden facades with similar the benefits as low maintenance green walls that increase biodiversity, reduce heat island effects, provide sound insulation, and reduce air pollution. 2 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number. This question is optional.

For each dataset or data type (observational, experimental etc.), provide a short name & description (sufficient for yourself to know what data it is about), indicate whether the data are newly generated/collected or reused, digital or physical, also indicate the type of the data (the kind of content), its technical format (file extension), and an estimate of the upper limit of the volume of the data . All data and research outputs will be evaluated by the PI (Rachel Armstrong) before making datasets open. For Open Access scientific publications, we will use public shared spaces e.g., arXiv.org. For Green open access Lirias is used. Other project outputs e.g., video, animations, public information are hosted on the project website, the Research Catalogue (www.researchcatalogue.net) and YouTube. After any IP concerns have been addressed (non-GDPR sensitive and unbound by confidentiality agreements) , datasets will be publicly available, and will be given DOI and made publicly available, being deposited in online trusted repositories such as Zenodo, with programming code (e.g. for novel patterns) deposited in GitHub and/or GitLab. Zenodo automatically assigns a persistent identifier (DOI) to all inputs, and the GitHub and GitLab repositories will be linked within the appropriate Zenodo repositories. KUL’s institutional repository RDR (https://rdr.kuleuven.be) will be used to ensure that all data has a DOI and metadata can be added so it is findable. If open access is not possible, reasons for restricted data sharing for datasets will be given . Bio+W uses transparent research design, robust statistical analyses, addresses negative results early and shares through a systematic approach to preregistration (protocols, methodology) using The Open Science Framework (OSF) and preprints using arXiv, with open access to software, workflows, tools, etc. ONLY FOR DIGITAL DATAONLY FOR DIGITAL DATAONLY FOR DIGITAL DATAONLY FOR PHYSICAL DATA Dataset NameDescription New or Reused Digital or Physical Digital Data TypeDigital Data Format Digital Data Volume (MB, GB, TB)Physical Volume Software generated patternsDesigned and evolved geometries for Generate new data DigitalPSD, PNG, TIFF, MP4, CAD filesPSD, PNG, TIFF, MP4, CAD files<1GB N/A 8 Bio+W Data Management Plan V1 FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuventexturing wooden surfaces 3D topologiesDesigned and evolved geometries for texturing wooden surfacesGenerate new data DigitalCAD files CAD files <1GB N/A Surface CoverPercentage of coverage of wooden tile surface (using grid) and species typeGenerate new data Digital and PhysicalText files, photographsWord, TIFF, PNG, JPG, txt.<1GB 10 x 10 or 30 x 30 cm2 tiles TEXTProtocols, description of research results, literature studiesGenerate new data DigitalTextual .txt 1GB N/A Microscopy ImagesHigh resolution images of tile surfacesGenerate new data DigitalImages, films TIFF, JPG, PNG, 100-200GB N/A Microscopy moviesHigh resolution images of tile surfacesGenerate new data DigitalMovies MP4 100-200GB N/A 9 Bio+W Data Management Plan V1 FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU LeuvenEnvironment al Data Relative humidity, lux (light intensity), temperature (surface and sub-surface) using on-site Generate new data DigitalNumerical .txt 100-200GB N/A Changes in mass of tilesGains and losses of mass during the experiment for water retention experimentsGenerate new data DigitalNumerical .txt 1 GB N/A Static bending and hardness testsBending strength and modulus of elasticity (flexural modulus) Generate new data DigitalNumerical, images.txt, PNG, TIFF, JPG, MP4 100-200GB N/A 10 Bio+W Data Management Plan V1 FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU LeuvenDocumentation and Metadata In Bio+W, different types of data will be stored in different file formats. All datasets will be exclusively in digital formats and will be created throughout the project as the result of experimental studies. These digital datasets will be stored in a variety of formats and will have volumes ranging from less than 1GB to greater than 50TB. The data and knowledge produced through this project will provide guidance for the incorporation of surface patterns into different kinds of woods to generate wooden panels with bioreceptive and aesthetic properties. Building on the natural properties of wood, Bio+C intensifies natural processes, which are enhanced by the bioreceptive design making them accessible to further colonisation by organisms, to increase biodiversity, perform ecosystem services and offer an attractive aesthetic appearance for installation within site-specific contexts. All data generated and/or collected through the project that can be made publicly available ( i.e., non-GDPR sensitive data and unbound to confidentiality agreements) will be deposited online in a trusted repository . The main repositories that will be used are Zenodo for the general content and GitHub and GitLab for programming code ( e.g., written in R). Data entered in GitHub/GitLab will be linked to Zenodo. All open access data in the repositories will by licensed through CC-BY, CC-0, or an equivalent license. Publications generated using project data will be deposited in a trusted repository at the time of publication. All information required for the understanding, reuse, or repurposing of the data will be attached to the data, and all information necessary to repeat, recreate, and validate the results will accompany the publications. In the repository, immediate open access will be provided. When reports or scientific papers are written using processed, pseudonymized, and/or anonymized data, open access will be granted through a trusted repository. Data containing GDPR-sensitive information and data obtained through confidentiality agreements will not be made publicly available, but these datasets will be deposited in a trusted data repository, with a DOI, metadata, and access restrictions in a repository like Zenodo or RDR. The data will be stored in open non-proprietary formats such as (JPEG/PNG/TIFF, PDF, PSD, MP4, txt, etc.). If proprietary formats are used internally, a usable copy will be available in one of the recommended open formats. All outputs or processed data produced through the project workflow that are neither confidential nor GDPR sensitive will be made publicly available as licensed under CC-BY or an equivalent/comparable license, with metadata licensed under CC-0, as is automatically done when using Zenodo. Data deposited in Zenodo will always be described with metadata and is compliant with DataCite, a leading global non-profit organization that provides persistent identifiers (specifically DOIs) for research data and other research outputs . All relevant materials will be directed to DataCite servers during DOI registration and indexed therein. Zenodo automatically catalogues the metadata, with relevant statistics reported, such that the data and metadata can be seamlessly harvested through the platform. 11 Bio+W Data Management Plan V1 FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU LeuvenClearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .Protocols All data will be made available collected throughout the project so it can be accessed (and therefore the results reproduced). Data/research outputs are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR)4. Types of data/research outputs include experimental laboratory data (images/microscopy, laboratory reports, text files, calculations, adapted figures), algorithms/AI, digital modelling software, drawings, images (photographs), integration protocols (documents), video, CAD files (3D models), design-led research outputs (video, photographs), and research publications (DTP, text/image). All deliverables will require the generation of novel (i.e., new) data by consortium members through surveys, meta-analyses, and experiments. Data Capture: information regarding choice of wood, materials (settings, parameters, set-up apparatus, physical conditions e.g. relative humidity) and experimental methods) will be carefully recorded and stored on a secure shared server using open non-proprietary formats such as (JPEG/PNG/TIFF, PDF, JSON, CSV, RDF). If proprietary formats are used internally, a usable copy will be available in one of the recommended open formats. The research progress and obtained data will be regularly documented, detailing the findings, and noting how the results were generated. Experimental data will be collected in an electronic notebook (eLABJournal) with folders provided for all subtasks of the project. In each folder, a new file will be made for each experiment, named with the date and subject, and including information on the people involved as well as version tracking. Each experimental file will contain a section on the objectives, protocols, results (a description of results and observations) and conclusions. For each experiment, all raw and analysed data files will be stored in a folder on the shared server, using the same hierarchical folder structure as the eLABJournal. By using the same structure on the server and in the electronic eLABJournal, 4 Mark D. Wilkinson; Michel Dumontier; IJsbrand Jan Aalbersberg; et al.

If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ No If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: No uniform metadata standard exists for all different aspects and disciplines of this project. Instead, a uniform system will be created for Bio+W to enhance the use of secondary data using the eLABJournal to establish several key, predetermined topics that are described for each experiment (objective, protocol, results, and conclusion). The eLABJournal therefore, facilitates searching for metadata using a search engine. By mimicking the folder structure of the eLABJournal the server-based folder with the experimental data, linking of the metadata to the actual data will be facilitated. 13 Bio+W Data Management Plan V1 FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU LeuvenData Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored?
