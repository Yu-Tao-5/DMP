The overuse and misuse of antimicrobials\nin humans, next to animals and plants are the main drivers in the development of drug-resistant bacteria. AMR affects countries in all\nregions and all income levels, but its consequences are exacerbated by poverty and equality. Therefore, low- and middle-income\ncountries, such as Ethiopia, are more affected. AMR makes infections harder to treat and makes other medical treatments, such as\nsurgery and cancer chemotherapy, much riskier. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS), bundling different types of interventions and\napproaches to warrant correct use of antimicrobials, is very important to combat emergence of AMR. In western Europe, AMS is\nnowadays accepted as standard-of-care in hospital setting. However, low income countries, such as Ethiopia, AMS is implemented in a\nvery fragmented way or absent. Objectives The aim of this PhD project is to develop and implement a complex PRIMED-AMS\nintervention’ in different tertiary care setting, ensuring optimal preparedness, initiation, modification, de-escalation, and discontinuation\nof antimicrobials in patients admitted with (severe) infections. With this, we aim to show that antimicrobial consumption will be reduced\nwhile maintaining the same efficacy (clinical cure rate) and safety. The primary endpoint is reduction in antimicrobial prescribing, and\nantimicrobial consumption (DDD/100 patient days) and the secondary endpoint includes reduction of emergence of antimicrobial\nresistance. After completion of the study, the data will be analyzed and finalized at the KU Leuven. A dissemination protocol, including\nbarriers and facilitators, will be developed to allow dissemination in other Ethiopian hospitals.\nID: \nID: \n213232\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-10-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n30-09-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n28-03-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
