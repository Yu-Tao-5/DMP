The F WO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official  start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel.  Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.  \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation  Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders \nand research institutions.  This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary  of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link.  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        2 \n 1.

One of the key challenges is to keep this growing population of older  adults \nactive and healthy. Several European countries are extending the retirement age.  Consequently, the \npopulation at work will also age. However, when we age, our executive functions (EFs) decline. EFs are vital \nto planning, thinking abstractly and comprehendi ng complex problems. The modern workplace often \nconfronts workers with various, often parallel, streams of information that need to be processed. This \nheavily relies on EFs. How can we reconcile the reliance on EFs at the workplace with the increase of old er \nworkers with declining EFs? The current project aims to focus on a cognitive skill that might remain intact \nor even improve with aging. Insight problem solving is the sudden retrieval of the solution into \nconsciousness after being stuck solving a proble m. It is often assumed to be an implicit process that does \nnot rely heavily on EFs. In contrast, analytical problem solving entails a conscious, effortful, step -by-step \napproach to obtain a solution. The aim of the current project is to study if and how ol der adults benefit from \ninsight as opposed to analytical problem solving. To achieve this, we will compare phenomenological, \nbehavioral and neural indices of insight and analytical problem solving between young adults and \nprofessionally active older adults . Furthermore, we will study how insight problem solving can be stimulated \nin professionally active older adults.  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        4 \n 2.

Documentation and Metadata  \n \nClearly describe what approach will be followed \nto capture the accompanying information \nnecessary to keep data understandable and \nusable , for yourself and others, now and in the \nfuture (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and \ntypes required, procedures u sed, Electronic Lab \nNotebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. \nwhere this information is recorded ). \n \nRDM guidance on documentation and metadata . \n First, each dataset will be accompanied by a codebook in an Excel -document to make the data \nunderstandable and usable. In th ese codebook s, I will explain what each variable means.  Namely, I will \nprovide specific information about the experimental data, questionnaires, ESM data, et c, such as the \nvariable labels, their description,  units  of measurement , and ranges. Each dataset will also be \naccompanied by a ReadMe text file , which will contain information about the content of the data : who \ncollected the data, when the data w ere collected, how the data were created (e.g., computer program \nwrites a  raw csv file to the local computer after the experiment) , to which research project the dataset \nbelongs , how the dataset should be opened , what  delimiter is used to separate the data , and the rights on \nthe dataset . \nSecond, each computer programming task will also be accompanied by a ReadMe text file  with details \nabout the number of trials, different conditions, a task description, etc.  Third , code explanation in file  will \nalso be added to all computer task  scripts  and coding scripts that contain code to clean and analyze the \ndata . In other words, e xplanatory comments are added  to the code for clarification so that third parties \nand I can understan d the code. Finally, study manuals  for each research project will be created t hat \ncontain the study protocol and that  will help collect the data in a standardized way.   \nFor each work package or research project, a new folder will be  created  on the OneDrive for Business of \nthe researcher  where all the data belonging to that specific project is stored. The folder structure  on the \nOneDrive for Bu siness  of the researcher will  be documented in a ReadMe tex t file. Within each main \nfolder, a number of subfolders will be created that refer  to a specific step in the research process ( e.g., \nEthical Approval, Programming, Preregistration, Data Collection, Data, Analyses, Results, and  Manuscript).  \nFurthermore,  I use GitLab as a versioning system  for working on my code to clean the data and analyze it  \nand Open Science Framework (OSF)  as a tool for data documentation .  \n \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        12 \n Will a metadata standard be used to make it \neasier to find and reuse the data ?  \n \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard \nwill be used.

KU Leuven provides an additional backup \non top of the measures that Microsoft provides as standard to protect the data . OneDrive for Business is \nsuitable for strictly confiden tial data, as long as multifactor authentication with the KU Leuven \nAuthenticator app is activated.  Therefore, KU Leuven OneDrive for Business  is suitable for storing personal \ndata. Data f iles will also be transferred to the supervisor  using the  Belnet fil esender . Paper data (e.g., \nquestionnaires) will be stored in a locked cabinet in the supervisor's office.  \n \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?  Usage of the KU Leuven OneDrive for Business is free.

Paper data will be stored in a \nclosed locket of the supervisor,  organized in a folder per study. In order to make the data publicly available  \nthrough OSF, the pseudonymized data  will later be anonymized by removing the participant number that \nlinks the personal data (i.e., names and email  addresses) to the data and by adding a new, random \nparticipant number. In this way , names and email address es can never be linked to the data obtained in \nthe study when consulting the openly available  data . The anonymized  data will be made publicly available \nthrough O SF. After the project is finished, the DOI identifier  will be registere d. In this way, the data  can \nalso be retrieved from KU Leuven RDR.  \nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during the expected retention \nperiod? How will these costs be covered?  \n \n Data preservation on the KU Leuven OneDrive for Business , OSF and KU Leuven RDR is free of charge. \nStorage capacity on the OneDrive for Business can be extended to 5 TB without costs. We do not expect to \nexceed 5 TB. In case we exceed this limit, possible expenses will  be covered  by the research group.  \n \n \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        15 \n 6.

    "clean_full_text": "FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 1 FWO DMP Template - Flemish Standard Data Management Plan Version KU Leuven Project supervisors (from application round 2018 onwards) and fellows (from application round 2020 onwards) will, upon being awarded their project or fellowship, be invited to develop their answers to the data management related questions into a DMP. The F WO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.

FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 3 Please provide a short project description We live in an aging society. One of the key challenges is to keep this growing population of older adults active and healthy. Several European countries are extending the retirement age. Consequently, the population at work will also age. However, when we age, our executive functions (EFs) decline. EFs are vital to planning, thinking abstractly and comprehendi ng complex problems. The modern workplace often confronts workers with various, often parallel, streams of information that need to be processed. This heavily relies on EFs. How can we reconcile the reliance on EFs at the workplace with the increase of old er workers with declining EFs? The current project aims to focus on a cognitive skill that might remain intact or even improve with aging. Insight problem solving is the sudden retrieval of the solution into consciousness after being stuck solving a proble m. It is often assumed to be an implicit process that does not rely heavily on EFs. In contrast, analytical problem solving entails a conscious, effortful, step -by-step approach to obtain a solution. The aim of the current project is to study if and how ol der adults benefit from insight as opposed to analytical problem solving. To achieve this, we will compare phenomenological, behavioral and neural indices of insight and analytical problem solving between young adults and professionally active older adults . Furthermore, we will study how insight problem solving can be stimulated in professionally active older adults. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 4 2.

It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all materials that need proper management because they are valuable, difficult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is a n integral part of your datasets and should described under documentation/metadata. RDM Guidance on data If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type . No. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number . ☒ Yes, huma n subject data ; provide SMEC or EC a pproval number: - 01- WP2: G-2022 -5918 -R3(AMD) - 02: Aha ! moments in daily life: G -2023 -7070 ☐ Yes, animal data ; provide ECD reference number: ☐ Yes, dual use; provide approva l number : ☐ No Additional information : We will ask the Social and Societal Ethics Committee for ethical approval before initiating the project's work packages that are not listed above (see SMEC approval numbers above for two work packages). As such, all work packages will fulfill the legal obligations regarding personal data. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9 Will you process personal data3? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number). ☒ Yes (provide PRET G -number or EC S -number below) ☐ No Additional information: Most datasets will contain personal da ta: - Name - Email address - Birth date - Ethnicity - Gender and biological sex - Education - Occupation and professional activities - Personal data concerning health (i.e., presence of neurological and psychiatric disorders, cancer treatments, medication intake, presence of bad/impaired vision, alcohol/drug abuse) Datasets that will contain personal data: - 01-WP2: Survey data - 01-WP2: Merged experimen tal data - 02- Aha! moments in daily life : Raw data - 02- Aha! moments in daily life: Processed data - 03-WP1+WP3: Survey data - 03-WP1+WP3: Merged experimental data - 04-WP4: Raw data - 04-WP4: Processed data PRET approval number: - 01-WP2: G-2022 -5918 -R3(AMD) - 02-Aha! moments in daily life: G -2023 -7070 We will submit PRET applications for the remaining work packages (WP1+WP3+WP4). Every participant will be assigned a participant number, which will be linked to all their data. Using the participant number, we will pseudonymize all data because only the main researchers will be able to link the behavioral data to participants’ personal info rmation (e.g., name or email address) for the purpose of the study. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10 Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer , for example spin - offs, commercial exploitation, … )?

If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. ☐ Yes ☒ No 3 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11 3. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures u sed, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata . First, each dataset will be accompanied by a codebook in an Excel -document to make the data understandable and usable. In th ese codebook s, I will explain what each variable means. Namely, I will provide specific information about the experimental data, questionnaires, ESM data, et c, such as the variable labels, their description, units of measurement , and ranges. Each dataset will also be accompanied by a ReadMe text file , which will contain information about the content of the data : who collected the data, when the data w ere collected, how the data were created (e.g., computer program writes a raw csv file to the local computer after the experiment) , to which research project the dataset belongs , how the dataset should be opened , what delimiter is used to separate the data , and the rights on the dataset . Second, each computer programming task will also be accompanied by a ReadMe text file with details about the number of trials, different conditions, a task description, etc. Third , code explanation in file will also be added to all computer task scripts and coding scripts that contain code to clean and analyze the data . In other words, e xplanatory comments are added to the code for clarification so that third parties and I can understan d the code. Finally, study manuals for each research project will be created t hat contain the study protocol and that will help collect the data in a standardized way. For each work package or research project, a new folder will be created on the OneDrive for Business of the researcher where all the data belonging to that specific project is stored. The folder structure on the OneDrive for Bu siness of the researcher will be documented in a ReadMe tex t file. Within each main folder, a number of subfolders will be created that refer to a specific step in the research process ( e.g., Ethical Approval, Programming, Preregistration, Data Collection, Data, Analyses, Results, and Manuscript). Furthermore, I use GitLab as a versioning system for working on my code to clean the data and analyze it and Open Science Framework (OSF) as a tool for data documentation . FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COUL D ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: There is no formally recognized metadata standard specific to psychology . The metadata of the entire PhD project will consist of codebook s, ReadMe text files and code explanations in file. Anonymized datasets will be added to the OSF. The anonymized data on OS F will contain unique identifiers (DOI) and relevant keywords to make the data easy to find. 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data. ☐ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I -drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on -premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☒ Other: Paper data (e.g., questionnaires) will be stored in a locked cabinet in the supervisor's office. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? ☒ Standard back -up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back -ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13 Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If no, please specify : How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . Guidance on security for research data Since we will be working with personal data, all the data will be stored on KU Leuven OneDrive for Business based on the recommendations made by KU Leuven. KU Leuven provides an additional backup on top of the measures that Microsoft provides as standard to protect the data . OneDrive for Business is suitable for strictly confiden tial data, as long as multifactor authentication with the KU Leuven Authenticator app is activated. Therefore, KU Leuven OneDrive for Business is suitable for storing personal data. Data f iles will also be transferred to the supervisor using the Belnet fil esender . Paper data (e.g., questionnaires) will be stored in a locked cabinet in the supervisor's office. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Usage of the KU Leuven OneDrive for Business is free. Therefore, there are no expected costs. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 14 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). Guidance on data preservation ☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be ke pt for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data . Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide . ☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): To archive data securely at the end of the project, all digital data will be stored on the KU Leuven OneDrive for Business of the supervisor (with a utomatic back -up procedures) for at least 10 years after the end of the project, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. Paper data will be stored in a closed locket of the supervisor, organized in a folder per study. In order to make the data publicly available through OSF, the pseudonymized data will later be anonymized by removing the participant number that links the personal data (i.e., names and email addresses) to the data and by adding a new, random participant number. In this way , names and email address es can never be linked to the data obtained in the study when consulting the openly available data . The anonymized data will be made publicly available through O SF. After the project is finished, the DOI identifier will be registere d. In this way, the data can also be retrieved from KU Leuven RDR. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Data preservation on the KU Leuven OneDrive for Business , OSF and KU Leuven RDR is free of charge. Storage capacity on the OneDrive for Business can be extended to 5 TB without costs. We do not expect to exceed 5 TB. In case we exceed this limit, possible expenses will be covered by the research group. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 15 6.
