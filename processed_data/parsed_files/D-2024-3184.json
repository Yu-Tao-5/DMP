Although modern intensive care has reduced mortality, a large number of\nsurvivors continue to require such supportive care in the ICU sometimes for weeks or months. Once in this prolonged phase, typical ICU-\nacquired morbidities such as lingering organ failure, muscle wasting and weakness and vasopressor- and ventilator-dependency become\nthe main drivers of poor short- and long-term outcome irrespective of the initial diagnosis upon admission. Research from our group has\nfocused on two of these unresolved problems, namely ICU-acquired muscle weakness and ICU-acquired adrenal insufficiency, for which\nthere is either no treatment or treatment has deleterious off-target effects that may fuel a vicious circle impairing short- and long-term\nrecovery. Today, intensivists see these conditions as two separate pathophysiological entities, an assumption we think is false. We\nhypothesize that ICU-acquired adrenal insufficiency shares upstream underlying mechanisms with ICU-acquired muscle weakness,\npathways that are currently unexplored and that can be manipulated with the potential to reverse both problems together. We will test\nthis hypothesis via an experimental and a clinical track. The proposal starts from a novel, controversial idea, developed via experiments in\na unique, clinically relevant and validated mouse model of sepsis-induced critical illness and via the study of human patients, and aims to\nclose the loop with a proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial. Our ambition is to identify and test a novel compound, or combination\nof compounds, to concomitantly reverse adrenal insufficiency and muscle weakness in prolonged critical illness, while avoiding\ndeleterious side-effects and aiming for synergy. Reaching this ambitious goal would represent ground-breaking progress.\nID: \nID: \n210056\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-10-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n30-09-2029\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n11-10-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

All characteristics can be queried to retrieve specific participants or\nsamples. Data can be exported as Excel files or csv files. The full study protocols describe data collection and definition of\nvariables. Standing operating procedures are in place to describe data collection. For individual data elements requiring\nexplanation, a definition is provided as info label in the structured database. All these documents are stored electronically in the\nstructured study master file. We will keep a separate registry documenting the names and locations for raw and processed data\nexports as used for every step in the project.\nAs soon as robust and conclusive data analyses will be achieved, data will be deposited in the Research Data Repository (RDR) of\nKU Leuven (\nhttps://rdr.kuleuven.be/)\n and will be available to the community upon reasonable request.\n2. Making data openly accessible\n2. Making data openly accessible\nAs soon as robust and conclusive data analyses will be achieved, data will be deposited in the Research Data Repository (RDR) of\nKU Leuven (\nhttps://rdr.kuleuven.be/)\n and will be available to the community upon reasonable request. \nAll materials/resources reused or newly generated in the project will be stored in-house and will be freely available to the\ncommunity upon reasonable request.\nThe clinical databases contain sensitive and personal information. Although the data are pseudonymized, theoretically, it could be\npossible to identify a patient based on a combination of demographic characteristics and admission date/diagnosis. Therefore, it\nis important to only share those data that are necessary to answer a specific research question. Study questions that fall outside\nthe original study question are subject to ethical approval. Hence, as data sharing would occur in the context of a new study\nquestion, ethical approval would be needed.\n3. Making data interoperable\n3. Making data interoperable\nData will be deposited in a format that can be accessible for everyone, and that is widely used as a standard in our scientific\ndiscipline. Mostly csv, txt and pdf file formats will be released to the KULeuven RDR.\n4. Increase data re-use\n4. Increase data re-use\nInformation on the research outputs and how to reuse/process released data with specific programs,\nsoftware, workflows, etc. (including version number and parameters initially used) will be clearly described in the different\ndepositories, where data will be accessible via the identifiers described above upon request.\nThe clinical databases contain sensitive and personal information.

Hence, as data sharing would occur in the context of a new study\nquestion, ethical approval would be needed.\n5. Allocation of resources and data security\n5. Allocation of resources and data security\nAccording to our plans, there will be no cost to make data and research outputs FAIR in this project, as repositories and other\nresources are provided by free, open access platforms. Data preservation on UZ Leuven servers is currently free of costs. Data\npreservation on KULeuven servers will be paid by other budgets of the laboratory of intensive care medicine.\nAll study databases are protected, accessible only with restricted user ID and password. Access control is set at network,\ndirectory and database level. User access and changes in the databases are recorded. \nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 11 October 2024\n7 of 7"

The data management plan with the required information on data collection and processing operations will be part of the protocols that will have to be approved by the Institutional Ethical Review Board for this phase 1 and phase 2 trial. Further details will be added to this data management plan in due time.

All characteristics can be queried to retrieve specific participants or samples. Data can be exported as Excel files or csv files. The full study protocols describe data collection and definition of variables. Standing operating procedures are in place to describe data collection. For individual data elements requiring explanation, a definition is provided as info label in the structured database. All these documents are stored electronically in the structured study master file. We will keep a separate registry documenting the names and locations for raw and processed data exports as used for every step in the project. As soon as robust and conclusive data analyses will be achieved, data will be deposited in the Research Data Repository (RDR) of KU Leuven ( https://rdr.kuleuven.be/) and will be available to the community upon reasonable request. 2. Making data openly accessible 2. Making data openly accessible As soon as robust and conclusive data analyses will be achieved, data will be deposited in the Research Data Repository (RDR) of KU Leuven ( https://rdr.kuleuven.be/) and will be available to the community upon reasonable request. All materials/resources reused or newly generated in the project will be stored in-house and will be freely available to the community upon reasonable request. The clinical databases contain sensitive and personal information. Although the data are pseudonymized, theoretically, it could be possible to identify a patient based on a combination of demographic characteristics and admission date/diagnosis. Therefore, it is important to only share those data that are necessary to answer a specific research question. Study questions that fall outside the original study question are subject to ethical approval. Hence, as data sharing would occur in the context of a new study question, ethical approval would be needed. 3. Making data interoperable 3. Making data interoperable Data will be deposited in a format that can be accessible for everyone, and that is widely used as a standard in our scientific discipline. Mostly csv, txt and pdf file formats will be released to the KULeuven RDR. 4. Increase data re-use 4. Increase data re-use Information on the research outputs and how to reuse/process released data with specific programs, software, workflows, etc. (including version number and parameters initially used) will be clearly described in the different depositories, where data will be accessible via the identifiers described above upon request.

Allocation of resources and data security According to our plans, there will be no cost to make data and research outputs FAIR in this project, as repositories and other resources are provided by free, open access platforms. Data preservation on UZ Leuven servers is currently free of costs. Data preservation on KULeuven servers will be paid by other budgets of the laboratory of intensive care medicine. All study databases are protected, accessible only with restricted user ID and password. Access control is set at network, directory and database level. User access and changes in the databases are recorded. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 11 October 2024 7 of 7"
