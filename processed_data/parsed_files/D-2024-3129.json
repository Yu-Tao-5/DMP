All work performed in the lab will be saved as an Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN). This notebook will contain all information on methodology, protocols, results, and conclusions. The ELN will be ordered chronologically, with a title for every date and a subtitle for every experiment. All data will be accompanied by appropriate documentation styles and tabs outlining procedures and standards followed during data collection and processing. Standard operating procedures and guidelines to be followed during data collection, processing, and laboratory work will be well documented in the lab. General protocols and standard operating procedures will be collected in a dedicated folder on a Shared network drive (J:) at KU Leuven. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 24 October 2024 4 of 8 Raw LC-MS, HPLC, and NMR data will be collected alongside a .txt file (README) describing the experimental conditions. All the images with their explanation will be saved in separate folders in the ELN. Background information will be stored in an Excel file and the Electronic Lab Notebook.

No The aforementioned methods of data documentation clearly ensure the exact documentation and finding of the data. Any specific data related to this project can be retrieved from the above documentation methods. In short, the metadata for most of the experiments are generated in a descriptive format that can be interpreted easily by other people in the future. The metadata for all NMR, LC-MS, and UV spectroscopic data will be available within the file format they will be stored in.

Shared network drive (J-drive) OneDrive (KU Leuven) Large Volume Storage Data will be stored on a network drive (J:) which is backed up by the ICTS service at KU Leuven. This includes monthly, time- stamped copies of each lab notebook, images, and spectroscopic data. Additional copies will be made and kept on personal devices. The network drive is only accessible to group members. Once a researcher leaves the lab, their data will be transferred to a large-volume network archive drive. All LC-MS data will be stored in duplicate on dedicated external hard drives. Bacterial strains and DNA plasmids will be kept in duplicate at -80 and -20°C freezers, respectively.

How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The KU Leuven shared network drive costs € 503,66/ TB / year. Additionally, a large volume storage drive from the KU Leuven costs € 104,42 / TB / year. This drive will be used to store all the large files. These costs, along with the costs for the external hard drives (approx. € 200) will be covered by the project budget.
