If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, explain how this will be taken care of. Yes We will use OneDrive (KU Leuven), J-drive and K-drive for data storage. If storage at OneDrive is not sufficient, data will be moved to the J- drive/K-drive. If storage capacity at J-/K-drive is not sufficient, we will contact ICTS of KU Leuven to increase the storage capacity according to our needs. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Patient-related data will be gathered in a case report form (CRF) and stored in a REDCap database (UZ Leuven). Genetic data will strictly be stored on network drives of KU Leuven, which are not accessible for unauthorized persons. Other research data will mostly be stored on these drives as well throughout the project, and completely at the end of the project. All storage spaces (OneDrive, J drive and K-drive) need researcher authorization for access, as they are secured with KU Leuven credentials and double authentication system.
