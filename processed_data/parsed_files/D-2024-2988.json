The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Karel Talavera (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3124-138X)\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Justyna Startek - postdoctoral fellow (http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1131-1149)\nProject number  & title Transient Receptor Potential and Piezo channels as molecular sensors of extracellular lipid vesicles \n(G0AAL24N)\nFunder(s) GrantID 2Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)\nAffiliation(s) ☒ KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\n Add rows for each dataset you want to describe.\n See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan  2 Funder(s) GrantID refers to the number of the DMP at the funder(s), here one can specify multiple GrantIDs if multiple funding sources were used.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 3Please provide a short project description Transient receptor potential (TRP) and Piezo channels are ubiquitous mechanosensory proteins and are \nthereby involved in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes and proposed as targets to \ntreat multiple human diseases. These channels are activated by mechanical stimuli inducing shear stress \nand changes in membrane curvature and tension, and by the perturbations produced by insertion of \nchemicals in cell membranes. Based on previous studies by our group and solid preliminary data, we here \nhypothesize that TRPs and Piezos can sense the extracellular lipid vesicles upon their interaction with the \nplasma membrane of target cells. We will test this hypothesis by using a wide variety of up-to-date \nexperimental techniques to: 1) screen the effects of natural and artificial lipid vesicles on TRP and Piezo \nchannels, 2) determine the mechanism whereby lipid vesicles activate these channels and 3) determine \nthe pathophysiological relevance of vesicle-channel interactions in somatosensory nerves and epithelial \ncells. Because TRP and Piezo channels are ubiquitously expressed, the confirmation of our hypothesis will \nindicate that these channels are universal mediators of the effects of lipid vesicles on target cells, via their \nkey regulatory roles of cellular signaling. Our findings will shed light on the mechanisms underlying the \nrole of extracellular vesicles in intercellular communication and of artificial lipid vesicles used as drug and \nvaccine vector delivery agents.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 41 Add rows for each dataset you want to describe.1.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) All data will be retained for a period of 10 years, including the relevant data such as the basis of publications, data that can only be generated or collected once or data likely to be reused within the research unit or in wider contexts. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): The data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic backup procedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?The costs are covered by the host laboratory. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☒ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: All digital data will be made available in a restricted access repository. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Scientific researchers will have to motivate why they want access to the data: -Studied topic -How is the data linked to the research domain? -Why is the data needed? -Which question/problem will the data help with? The other researchers will be asked to give credit to the original creators of the data. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☒ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Other data repository : in an Open Access repository (GitHub) ☒ Other: upon request by email When will the data be made available? ☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT.
