Diagnostic indicators\nserve as tools to evaluate the condition of a rotating component and can be subdivided into two types. Indirect diagnostic indicators are\nbased on signal processing and machine learning techniques applied on indirect measurements such as acceleration, sound or rotational\nspeed. Direct diagnostic indicators can be defined as based on direct damage measurements by using images. Online monitoring\nsystems exist using indirect diagnostic indicators, but these are rarely compared with direct damage measurements. Therefore, this\nproposal aims to develop a standalone direct monitoring (vision) system which is able to detect defects in rotating machinery at\noperational conditions, in order to serve as a ground truth for novel indirect monitoring techniques, with a focus on encoder\nmeasurements and pitting on gears. Firstly, a design for an online vision system is developed which should be robust against the harsh\nconditions in a gearbox complicating the visual access to the gear teeth. Secondly, novel encoder-based diagnostic indicators for gear\nmonitoring are investigated and developed. The third step consists of integrating the two systems and methods on in-house test rigs with\nindustrially relevant gearboxes.\nLast modified: \n27-04-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
