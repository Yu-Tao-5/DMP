These documents will include the most relevant experimental details ensuring the reproducibility of the results. All the dataset generated during the research will be labeled descriptively, including fabrication details of the sample (e.g. date_material_synthesis conditions_processing parameters), in such a way that all the data can be re-analyzed in the future if needed and the samples can be reproduced. An electronic lab notebook will be created for each experiment, containing a brief description of the sample (including synthesis and processing parameters), the goal of the experiment and the main observations of the researcher. The fabrication protocol developed during the project will be written and continuously updated. These reports will be stored internally as Standard Operating Procedure (SOPs) for future researchers and will be shared under request for external researchers. 3. Resources and responsibilities 3.
