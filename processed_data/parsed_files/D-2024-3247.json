The protein is attached to axonal\nmicrotubules, but pathogenic mutations or hyperphosphorylation induce it to detach. The accumulation of Tau at synapses ultimately\ninduces synaptic dysfunction and degeneration. I previously showed that the presynaptic problems provoked by Tau are sufficient to\ninduce cognitive decline, and rescuing the Tau-induced presynapse-specific defects prevents cognitive decline in a tauopathy mouse\nmodel. This proof-of-concept suggests that interfering with functions of Tau in a cell-compartment-specific manner (synapses only),\nrather than bluntly removing the protein altogether, may be an effective strategy to treat tauopathies; however, the exact mode-of-action\nof Tau at synapses, and effective methodology to target Tau at synaptic compartments remain poorly explored. Here, I will perform a\nsynapse-specific proteomic screen using a well-established mouse model and a genetic screen using validated fly Tau models to identify\ndruggable synaptic targets for the treatment of tauopathy. I will then develop antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to 2 of these targets (one\ntarget, Crmp, is already identified) and test these in relevant cell and animal models.\nID: \nID: \n214381\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-10-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n30-09-2027\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n08-04-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

The protein is attached to axonal microtubules, but pathogenic mutations or hyperphosphorylation induce it to detach. The accumulation of Tau at synapses ultimately induces synaptic dysfunction and degeneration. I previously showed that the presynaptic problems provoked by Tau are sufficient to induce cognitive decline, and rescuing the Tau-induced presynapse-specific defects prevents cognitive decline in a tauopathy mouse model. This proof-of-concept suggests that interfering with functions of Tau in a cell-compartment-specific manner (synapses only), rather than bluntly removing the protein altogether, may be an effective strategy to treat tauopathies; however, the exact mode-of-action of Tau at synapses, and effective methodology to target Tau at synaptic compartments remain poorly explored. Here, I will perform a synapse-specific proteomic screen using a well-established mouse model and a genetic screen using validated fly Tau models to identify druggable synaptic targets for the treatment of tauopathy. I will then develop antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to 2 of these targets (one target, Crmp, is already identified) and test these in relevant cell and animal models.

The organisation of research data follows a hierarchical folder structure folder structure based on model organism (eg. flies/mice/hamsters/cells). At the second level, these folders contain subfolders per experiment type (eg. western blotting, ERG, EM, immunofluorescence,...). At the third level, these folders contain subfolders per individual experiment (with date indication, see below). Each of these experiment folders contain subfolders for raw data, processed data, and analysed data. Digital files and folders of individual experiments will be named named following a standard naming convention. All file names in a given dataset will follow the same format: they will start with the date, followed by the project acronym, a concise descriptive name, and an optional version number. Whenever possible, names will be kept under 32 characters, containing only letters, numbers, and underscores. Dots will only be used for version control indicators (minor revisions indicated by decimal numbers, and major revisions by whole numbers): YYYYMMDD_Project_Experiment_ version.format. Similarly, folder naming for individual experiments follows the following structure: YYYYMMDD(_Project)_Experiment Data will be accompanied by documentation documentation containing all contextual and descriptive features of the research data, which allow to understand and (re)use the data. Detailed procedures of each experiment are logged in the electronic laboratory notebook ( E- E- notebook) notebook) , with reference of each experiment to the directory path of the folder containing raw and analysed data files. This also includes data collection methods, protocols, and code explanation. Documentation is stored at the study- and the data-level, providing data provenance from the original source data to specific datasets linked to publications. Data will be generated following standardized protocols protocols . Clear and detailed descriptions of these protocols will be stored in our lab protocol database and E-notebook. Metadata Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the E-notebook and/or in hard copy lab notebooks that refer to specific datasets. To allow long term access and use of research data will be stored or converted to open file formats open file formats as much as possible. We use controlled vocabularies controlled vocabularies or ontologies when applicable to provide unambiguous meaning, for example: • Gene Onotology: molecular function, cellular component, and biological role of RNA seq • ENSEMBL or NBCI identifiers: gene identity • HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee: names and symbol of human genes • FlyBase: names and symbol of Drosophila genes • UniProt protein accessions: protein identity Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data?

Digital data Digital data Primary storage for active digital files active digital files will be on KU Leuven servers. KU Leuven offers fast (\"J-drive) and slower (\"L-drive\") storage that allows reading/writing/modification of non-confidential, confidential, and strictly confidential data. KU Leuven further offers the ManGO platform for storage and management of large volumes of active research data large volumes of active research data . This platform allows secure storage, manual and automated metadata coupling, data workflows, and file sharing. Data that is no longer active, can be archived archived on the KU Leuven K-drive, which allows reading of non-confidential, confidential, and strictly confidential data. Physical samples Physical samples Tissue samples will be stored locally in the laboratory. Cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid nitrogen storage and will be deposited in the UZ Leuven-KU Leuven Biobank. Fly line stocks are preserved as a minimum of two separate cultures, each maintained at 18°C on a 4-to-5-week generation cycle. Mice will be maintained in facilities of the Laboratory Animal Center of KU Leuven, which applies Standard Operation Procedures concerning housing, feeding, health monitoring to assure consistent care in accordance with European and national regulations and guidelines. All animals will be registered in the Leuven Animal Information System (LAIS) database, along with corresponding genotyping information, ethical approval documents and animal provider receipts. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? KU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme: - data stored on the “ L-drive L-drive ” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept. - data stored on the “ J-drive J-drive ” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept. - data stored in ManGO ManGO : Snapshots are made at regular intervals (hourly, daily and monthly) in case data needs to be recovered. The data itself is synchronized on two separate hardware storage systems, each 6 PB large, located at Leuven and at Heverlee (ICTS). The data is protected against calamities at either site by synchronizing it in real-time at hardware level. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project?
