The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Joren Peeters https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5589-7981  \nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Ernst Wolff (supervisor) https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1203-0664  \nMassimiliano Simons (co-supervisor) https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8751-9152  \nProject number 1 & title 3H240594 What Waste?

In line with the \nincreasing focus on concrete materials, practices, and discourses in  environmental \nphilosophy, and drawing on insights  from the practice turn in the philosophy of science, this \nproject will contribute to filling this lacuna. The main hypothesis is that there is not \none universal concept of  waste, but only different situated conceptualizations of waste \nembedded in different practices and concerns. The main objective  is to construct \na theoretical framework that connects different conceptualizations of waste and explains \nhow they function in practice. To arrive at this objective, I  will first draw from waste and \ndiscard studies. More precisely, the ongoing debate  on the nature of waste in these fields \nprovides a perfect case to map out different conceptualizations of waste, and the typology \nof the three main approaches to waste can function as a starting point  for this investigation. \nI will then investigate how  these conceptualizations of waste function in practice by a) \nconducting a textual case study of the  debate on e-waste, and b) conducting an \nempirical case study of the different municipal cleaning  services of Amsterdam.
