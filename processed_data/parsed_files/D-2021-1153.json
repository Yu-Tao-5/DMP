The\ngoal of this project is to investigate the neural mechanisms for novelty detection. To do so, I use mice as an animal model and\ncollect data on their response to novel stimuli: at the behavioral level (videos) and on the neural level (using recording of\nelectrophysiology). I also keep brain slice to ensure where we are recording in the brain.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. General Information\nName applicant\nEleonore Schiltz\nFWO Project Number & Title\n1135122N & Investigating the neural mechanisms for novelty detection\n \nAffiliation\nKU Leuven\nOther\nVIB, IMEC\n2. Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. This may be\neasiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and per WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing\ndata, specify the source of these data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nThe research will generate\n - Anatomical data: Microscopy images and anatomical reconstructions (.tif,jpeg,digital). Physical originals (brain sections) are\nsaved as well. 100 GB maximum.\n - Behavioral data (digital) including videos of breathing rate, pupil dilation, mouse position on the virtual track, stimulus\ndelivery times and choices. We will save raw data together with their extracted information (.mov, .mat, tdms). 1TB.\n- Electrophysiological data (digital): raw recording data will be saved together with processed, spike-sorted data.\n(.ap,tdms,.mat,.npy) 20 TB.\n3. Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use.

Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this project?\n1. The behavioral and neural preprocessed data will be made available on a python (numpy) format with an\nexplicit name for each variable and a readme for a good comprehension of the dataset.\n2.

Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\n1. The brain slices will be stored in the fridge of the laboratory.\n2. The behavioral and neural data will be stored on the server sysfs01. A back-up is used on another server, and the\ninvestigator will keep another copy of the data on a hard-disk at her place.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe data will be stored on two different servers at the institute, and a third back-up will be keep at the investigator place on a\nhard disk to avoid losing the data in case of natural disaster.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.

How will these costs be covered?\n1. The hard disk will cost around 400 euros.\n2. The servers are already there, so only the costs of energetic consumptions are taken into account. It should not be more than\n1000 euros per year depending on the electricity price and those costs will be covered by the VIB grant of my principal\ninvestigator Sebastian Haesler.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by\nunauthorized persons?\nAn engineer in computer science is paid by the institute to ensure the security of the servers.
