This\ntransition is being driven by tremendous efforts and progress, at an international scale, to address quantum states and to exploit their quantum\nsuperposition and entanglement, creating new opportunities not only for fundamental science but also for quantum technologies. This movement is\noften referred to as the Second Quantum Revolution. One of the main efforts within this revolution is to search for new solid state systems that can be\noperated as qubit systems, and understand the interplay between their solid state properties (atomic-scale structure, electronic properties, …) and their\nquantum functionality (quantum coherence, initialization and readout…). This project aims exactly at that, focusing on a particularly promising type of\nsolid state qubit: spin defects in solids. Whereas extensive research has been devoted in the past to well-established defects in 3D (bulk) materials, e.g.\nNV centers in diamond and donors in silicon, this project deals with new quantum defects in 2D systems (2D materials and surfaces). In particular, we\nwill develop the creation of these new defects using a unique technique, ultralow energy ion implantation, and investigate the relation between their\nsolid state properties and their quantum functionality, opening new opportunities for the development of scalable, spin-based quantum technologies.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n25-06-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
