Many \ngenes have been discovered by whole exome/genome sequencing (WES/WGS) but their exact role in \nplatelet formation and function remains unknown due to the lack of animal or efficient cell-based models. \nToday, high throughput-sequencing multi-gene panel tests comprising these genes can diagnose 48 to 26%  \nof patients with platelet formation and function disorders, respectively.

SURVEY RESULTS, SENSOR READINGS, SENSORY OBSERVATIONS); EXPERIMENTAL (E.G. MICROSCOPY, SPECTROSCOPY, CHROMATOGRAMS, GENE SEQUENCES); COMPILED/AGGREGATED DATA5 (E.G. TEXT & DATA MINING, DERIVED VARIABLES, 3D MODELLING); SIMULATION DATA (E.G. CLIMATE MODELS); SOFTWARE, ETC. EXAMPLES OF DATA FORMATS: TABULAR DATA (.POR,. SPSS, STRUCTURED TEXT OR MARK-UP FILE XML, .TAB, .CSV), TEXTUAL DATA (.RTF, .XML, .TXT), GEOSPATIAL DATA (.DWG,. GML, ..), IMAGE DATA, AUDIO DATA, VIDEO DATA, DOCUMENTATION & COMPUTATIONAL SCRIPT. DIGITAL DATA VOLUME: PLEASE ESTIMATE THE UPPER LIMIT OF THE VOLUME OF THE DATA PER DATASET OR DATA TYPE. PHYSICAL VOLUME: PLEASE ESTIMATE THE PHYSICAL VOLUME OF THE RESEARCH MATERIALS (FOR EXAMPLE THE NUMBER OF RELEVANT BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES THAT NEED TO BE STORED AND PRESERVED DURING THE PROJECT AND/OR AFTER). If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type. WGS data: This data is stored on secured servers of University of Cambridge-UCAM High Performance Computing facility, Freson K (promotor) has access to this server. RNAseq: part of this data (20 control platelet samples) has been generated during the PhD of Fabienne Ver Donck and is stored on the EGAS000106339 archive. 5 These data are generated by combining multiple existing datasets. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 8Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, please describe these issues further and refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate.☒ Yes, human subject data ☐ Yes, animal data ☐ Yes, dual use ☐ No If yes, please describe: Reference to ethical committee approval: S63666 Will you process personal data? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. If available, add the reference to your file in your host institution's privacy register.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes: -Short description of the kind of personal data that will be used: Whole genome sequencing, RNA sequencing and personal metadata (age, gender, clinical condition, laboratory data (hemostatic tests results), blood counts) will be collected -Privacy Registry Reference: not applicable Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin- offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please comment: If data will be obtained of interest for valorization, IP restriction will be claimed. It is not clear from the start what novel genetic targets relevant for megakaryopoeisis and platelet formation/function can be identified. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please explain: The megakaryocyte model itself \"imMKCL\" cannot be protected by IP restrictions as this model was developed by our collaborators and we have signed an MTA (with dr K Eto, Kyoto university). If this model is needed for the overall IP restriction, a joined application is a possibility (as stated in the MTA). The flow chamber to enhance platelet production from imMKCL cells from the Bristol group (PI A. Poole) cannot be protected by IP restrictions as we have signed an MTA to use these slides in this project. Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3.Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded).Generated sequencing data will be uploaded to EGA in combination with related metadata (e.g. age, gender, case/control status, sequencing platform/library... etc.) to be accessible to the public. Flow cytometry and sorting: information on gating strategy for cell identification and sorting will be saved in electronic files with details on antibody concentrations and protocols for cell preparation and staining will be described in detail in lab books. Imaging (confocal and cytation5 imager): images and settings will be saved in electronic files. Details on staining techniques and antibody or dye concentrations and protocols for cell preparation will be described in detail in lab books. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: The metadata standards of EGA will be used for submission of sequencing data, as can be consulted on https://ega-archive.org/submission/sequence/unaligned If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored?
