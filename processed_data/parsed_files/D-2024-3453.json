Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) Other, please specify: For each outcome of the PhD project (models, imaging datasets, new techniques, etc), IP rights will be ad hoc discussed with the partners involved in the project and the Tech Transfer Office of the UCLouvain and the KU Leuven. Trade off between patenting and open access will be considered. Once IP is protected, the outcome will be made available via Open Access repositories or upon request after publication. Especially for the imaging datasets, which are very large (>50GB/dataset), the data will be made available upon request and can be send via BelNet Filesender or via transvol (UCLouvain). For the mechanical data and the models, they will be made available upon request, via scientific papers and 'data papers' if supported by the journals, via data repositories, such as for example Zenodo, or other repositories upon request, etc. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. The restriction of the imaging datasets comes mainly due to the large size of the datasets, and the related cost for long term storage in open access repositories. Therefore, the datasets will be made available upon request, and can be send via BelNet FileSender or transvol (UCLouvain). Once IP is secured and once the related results, datasets are published, everyone should be able to obtain access to the imaging datasets upon request. For the smaller datasets (i.e. models, protocols, mechanical data), once published, the datasets should be accessible via open access repositery. Created using DMPonline.be.

Yes, Other My PhD is a joint-PhD between the university of KU Leuven and UCLouvain. Therefore, a joint-PhD agreement will be signed, which states that the property, publication, use and protection of the results of the research is common to the two host institutions and are required to be in conformity both with the specific procedures in each of the two communities as well as the relevant internal regulations of each institution. Any cases of potential conflict in the provisions will form the subject of arbitration between the KU Leuven and the UCLouvain. This can restrict or prevent the sharing of my data. Furthermore, the large size of the imaging datasets and the cost related to long term storage in open access repositories, can also be a restriction to sharing in open access such datasets. In this case, the imaging datasets will be made available upon request. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.
