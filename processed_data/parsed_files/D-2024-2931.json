The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal.

Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan.

There is growing evidence that phytoplankton or\nextracellular polymers produced by phytoplankton induce flocculation of sediments, with important\nimplications of sediment transport. Flocculation of small sediment particles into larger flocs in turn\nreduces underwater light extinction and, hence, may enhance phytoplankton primary production.\nConsequently, phytoplankton could be viewed as engineering its environment by reducing turbidity\nthrough flocculation.

The novelty of the current approach\nconsists in an intensive characterization of field conditions and the replication of field conditions in\nthe lab and decomposition of parameters inducing flocculation in a factorial laboratory experiment.\nGathered insights will subsequentially be incorporated in a coupled flocculation, phytoplankton and\nsediment transport model.

RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .1.TELEMAC model will be saved along with a script (Fortran source) in the same folder in which explanatory comments are included. Additional calculations (with relevant input data) will be made in Excel and saved in the corresponding folder. 2.Sediment and Phytoplankton data files will be saved with date and sample type. An overview Excel will be set-up with relevant data, on which further reporting can be done. 3.Sediment and Phytoplankton samples will be saved at 4 degrees with date and sample type. After processing measurement results will be documented in folders with date of measurement, and subfolders with the sample type. Here, a text file is included of the sediment and phytoplankton analysis, jpg files of the images describing sample locations. 4.Elevation data will be saved in excel (dGPS data) and as Geotiffs. Raw data and agisoft-data- processing will be settings will be safed in an excel file. 5.Rotational Flume data and Flow velocity data will be saved as raw-data files (*.udt; *.csv) with the respective post-processing scripts(python). Data properties such as measurement location or experimental run ID will be shown in an overview Excel file for all the experimental runs, together with the operating conditions and date. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data.☒ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☐ Other: How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? ☒ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back-ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No Storage capacity is resp. 50 GB and 0.99 TB at personal and shared network drive of KU Leuven which is automatically backed-up. The network drives can also be accessed at drives.kuleuven.be. KU Leuven has concluded an agreement with the online cloud storage provider Box. Here, an additional capacity of 100 GB can be stored with a maximum file size of 15 GB, and, when necessary, storage capacity can be extended to 400 GB. Moreover, standard every KU Leuven user has 2 TB with a maximum file size of 100 GB on OneDrive for Business, and an option to extend the capacity to 5 TB without costs. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data Only the (co)promotors and involved researchers (e.g. thesis students) have access to the shared folders where the data, analysis files and reports will be stored on OneDrive for Business. Additionally, the two-factor authentication of KU Leuven provides secure storage against unauthorized persons. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?The amount of data that will be generated in this project should not exceed a fe w hundred of GBs, which can be stored (with automatic back-up) on the current university's central servers without extra cost. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☒ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY.

FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?

If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS.

How will these costs be covered? Freeware such as WeTransfer can be used to transfer and share the files. 7. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project?The PI, co-PI and promotor of the project. Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project?The PI, co-PI and promotor of the project, together with the IT service that is responsible for the implementation of the storage and regular back up on the shared d s Who will manage data preservation and sharing?The PI, co-PI and promotor of the project. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 15Who will update and implement this DMP?
