VIB has a policy to actively monitor research data for such potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of cases the invention will be IP protected (mostly patent protection or copyright protection). As such the IP protection does not withhold the research data from being made public.

Data will be generated following standardized protocols. Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook) and/or in hard copy lab notebooks that refer to specific datasets. Cryotubes of biological samples (bacterial and yeast strains) stored at -80°C will be labelled with a reference number that links to an entry in or strain database. All datasets will be accompanied by a README.txt file containing all the associated metadata (see more details below). The data will be generated following standardized protocols.

Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? All other electronic files (text documents, images, sequences): will be stored on KU Leuven servers, with hourly on-site backup and mirroring or stored on a cloud-based service offered by KU Leuven (OneDrive). In addition data will be regularly backed -up and stored on an external harddrive. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? KU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme: - data stored on the “ L-drive L-drive ” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept. - data stored on the “ J-drive J-drive ” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept. - data stored on the digital vault is backed up using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. As standard, 10% of the requested storage is reserved for backups using the following backup regime: an hourly backup (at 8 a.m., 12 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.), the last 6 of which are kept; a daily backup (every day) at midnight, the last 6 of which are kept; and a weekly backup (every week) at midnight between Saturday and Sunday, the last 2 of which are kept. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes There is sufficient storage and back-up capacity on all KU Leuven servers: - the “L-drive” is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster with NetApp eseries storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front-end. - the “J-drive” is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controlers with an Ontap 9.1P9 operating system. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Both the “L-drive” and “J-drive” servers are accessible only by laboratory members, and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The total estimated cost of data storage during the project is based on the following costs: - The costs of digital data storage are as follows: €173,78/TB/Year for the “L-drive” and €519/TB/Year for the “J-drive”. . All published lines will be preserved for the remainder of the PI’s research career.

As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org). Sharing policies for specific research outputs are detailed below: Cell lines: All human pluripotent cell lines supporting publications will be registered in hPSCreg, the European human embryonic stem cell registry supported by the European Commission (https://hpscreg.eu/). Information about the deposited lines (including donor information, derivation method, availability and characterization) will also be made accessible. Registration of cell lines in hPSCreg will provide visibility, confirm ethical procurement and facilitate comparison with other hiPSC lines. The PI will remain the distributor of the pluripotent cell lines. Other digital datasets that support publications (including image, video or audio files, spectroscopy data and simulation data) will be made publicly available via an open research data platform such as Mendeley Data or Zenodo.

Research documentation: All protocols used to generate published data will be described in the corresponding manuscript(s), and the related documentation will be included as supplementary information. These data and all other documents (daily logs, raw data) are accessible to the PI and the research staff, and will be made available upon request. Manuscripts: All scientific publications will be shared openly. Manuscripts submitted for publication will be deposited in a pre-print server such as bioRxiv, arXiv, Nature Precedings or ASAPbio). At the time of publication, research results will be summarized on the PI’s website (add website address) and postprint pdf versions of publications will be made available there if allowed by copyright agreements, possibly after an embargo as determined by the publisher. Before the end of the embargo or in cases where sharing the post-print is not allowed due to copyright agreements, a pre-print version of the manuscript will be made available. Publications will also be automatically listed in our institutional repository, Lirias 2.0, based on the authors name and ORCID ID.
