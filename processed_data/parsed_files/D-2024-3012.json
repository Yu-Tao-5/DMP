These consequences have a prolonged and adverse influence on social integration and well-\nbeing. The WHO highlights considerable financial costs, including morbidity, healthcare expenses, emotional issues and social exclusion for patients,\ntheir environments and society. The objective of this study is to compare high and low intensity speech intervention in children with CP±L based on\nthe perceptions of the intervention providers (speech therapists in primary care) and intervention recipients (children with CP±L and their caregivers).\nParticipation in this study includes taking part in a semi-structured interview. These interviews will be analyzed using both inductive and deductive\napproaches. After the interview, the participants are required to fill out a questionnaire regarding their demographics.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n23-02-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
