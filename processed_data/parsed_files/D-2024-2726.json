And while facilities exist to provide pointed radial velocity (RV) follow-up on exoplanets detected via transit, a large\nsweeping survey has yet to be undertaken. The international MARVEL project will accomplish this with 1 m/s precision, exploiting an ultra stable,\nhigh resolution echelle spectrograph fiber fed by an array of 4 independent telescopes. Using a prism cross disperser, the telescopes can either work in\nunison focusing on the same star, or be used to observe four separate objects simultaneously. \nThis PhD project is fully embedded into the MARVEL project and I will focus on the final commissioning of the facility, and its scientific exploitation\nfollowing first light in late 2024. I will investigate a novel wavelength calibration method involving a rubidium locked Fabry Pérot étalon, and integrate\nit into the MARVEL instrument. As part of the end-to-end instrument evaluation, I will identify, quantify, and mitigate sources of noise, in order to\nhelp the spectrograph reach 1 m/s precision. After commissioning, I will lead an RV follow-up of promising exoplanet candidates around F, G, K, or M\ntype stars detected by the TESS satellite, demonstrating the scientific capabilities of MARVEL.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n26-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). institutional policies...). Observational spectroscopic data, design data, and characterization data, will be stored for at least 5 years. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Observational spectroscopic data, design data, and characterization data will be stored on both MARVEL telescope array servers and KU Leuven’s Institute of Astronomy servers, which will remain in operation far beyond 5 years. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Costs for data preservation will be handled internally by the KU Leuven's Institute of Astronomy. Datasets for this project are not expected to incur significant costs for data preservation 5.

In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. data type which data will be made available. Yes, in an Open Access repository Observational spectroscopic datasets collected by the MARVEL array will be stored in the commonly used .fits format, and released in an open access repository. Code to produce simulation datasets will also be available as open access via GitHub. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. For one year following our observations, data will subject to one year proprietary access by our MARVEL consortium members, so that we have time to work with and publish results using it. Following the proprietary period, observational data will become open access.

Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. Data will be made available without cost on CDS, Strasbourg astronomical Data Center (https://cds.unistra.fr/). This allows open access to astronomers and the public worldwide. If published in a scientific article, it would be possible to access through the NASA's Astronomical Database System (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/). Code to produce simulation datasets will also be available as open access via GitHub. When will the data be made available? When will the data be made available? The observational spectroscopic datasets collected by the MARVEL array will be accessible by the public upon publication via databases such as NASA ADS (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/), CDS (https://cds.unistra.fr/), and KU Leuven Lirias. If not published within scientific articles, observational data will be made publicly available one year proprietary access following our observations on CDS.
