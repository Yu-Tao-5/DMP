Large efforts in mapping the expression of these molecules across brains is\nrevealing common features of the brain’s chemoarchitecture. Yet, it remains unclear how neuromodulator pathways change throughout development or\nto what extent non-neuronal cells participate. This project will uncover how the neuromodulator network matures at a systems level by analyzing\nrecent transcriptional atlases of all somatic cells of the nematode C. elegans across larval and adult stages. First, the expression of neuromodulators and\ntheir receptors will be systematically compared to trace all putative cell-to-cell connections across life stages. Next, I will use network science to\ninvestigate the interactions between neuromodulators and synaptic connectivity between neurons, glia, and muscles, which will pinpoint cells where\naminergic and/or neuropeptide signaling converge to control behavior and physiology. Finally, neuromodulator signaling will be connected to neural\nfunction by assessing to what extent signaling motifs predict functional connectivity in brain-wide neuronal imaging datasets. Doing so for adult worms\nwill guide targeted in vivo experiments to characterize changes in neuromodulator function throughout development. Given neuromodulator pathways\nshow evolutionary consistency in their functions and structure, this work promises to uncover principles of neuromodulator function generalizable\nacross animals.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n15-05-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Yes Biological imaging data will be stored following the OME (Open Microscopy Environment) standard to encode metadata on microscopy experiments in image files metadata (*.tif, *tiff, *.hdf5, *.czi). Metadata about strain and plasmid collections will be created manually, following the community guidelines as published on the Nomenclature section of the community resource Wormbase (www.wormbase.org). For software code (MATLAB with *.m; Python with *.py or *.ipnyb; R with .r) core calculation functionality is programmed and commented in the source code. Comments and Notebooks will be used to keep all information necessary to understand and reuse the code. Reference to any additional and necessary data/functions are made directly in the code and/or README.txt files bundled together with the software code. Created using DMPonline.be.

Where will the data be stored? During the research, all digital data will be stored on Desktop File Storage. The ICT team of the Biology Department will facilitate the technical infrastructure and authentication to access stored files through KU Leuven's Active Directory (Luna). Hardcover notebooks will be kept personally by all researchers involved during the project, and by the PI after the end of the project. Samples will be stored in central stock collections of the lab. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Network storages (fee-based) for digital data are hosted in the KU Leuven ICTS data center, with incremental backups on at least a daily basis. All data is mirrored to a second ICTS data center. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project?

Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? After the research, digital data will be archived for at least 5 years on Large Volume Storage hosted in the KU Leuven ICTS data center with automatic back-up procedures. Samples will be kept for long-term storage in frozen stock collections (-80 freezer or liquid nitrogen). What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period?
