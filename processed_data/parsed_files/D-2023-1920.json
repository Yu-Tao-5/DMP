The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID NENA BOBOVNIK 0000-0002-5824-4783\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles\nProject number1 & title  1197923N, The Magna Moralia and its Contribution to Medieval Moral Philosophy\nFunder(s) GrantID2\nAffiliation(s) ☐ KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nProvide ROR3 identifier when possible:  \nPlease provide a short project description\nThe project aims at studying the medieval Latin translation of Aristotle’s ethical treatise, Magna Moralia. \nIts objective is twofold: I will first and foremost provide the first critical edition of Magna Moralia while I \nwill also study the reception history of this work up until the dawn of the modern era.  \n2.Research Data Summar\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.
