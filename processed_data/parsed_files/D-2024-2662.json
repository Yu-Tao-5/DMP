More specifically, it follows up and\nextends on a recent description of equivariant Kasparov theory for C*-dynamical systems. The first\nobjective is to redevelop the basics of equivariant KK-theory from the point of view of the Cuntz-\nThomsen picture, including a self-contained new description of the Kasparov product. A parallel\nobjective is to introduce equivariant KL-theory for C*-dynamical systems, to study its analogous\nproperties as KK, and to deduce its role in the classification of group actions on Kirchberg algebras.\nThe more ambitious part of the project is to explore consequences of the universal coefficient\ntheorem à la Köhler-Meyer for group actions, at least for relatively tame cases such as actions of\nfinite cyclic groups.\nThe last objective is to introduce a notion of ”equivariant total K-theory” and to investigate whether it\nrelates to equivariant KL-theory in the spirit of the Dadarlat-Loring universal multicoefficient theorem\nfor C*-algebras.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n09-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Due to the very small size of the data produced (<100MB of .tex and .pdf files), sufficient storage is guaranteed. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The data is theoretical and thus there is no need for such measures. None of the data related to the project is personal, sensitive, or warrants strict access procedures. By the design of the university's online infrastructure, the data stored via OneDrive can only be opened on the personal computers of staff members, or remotely by logging into OneDrive with the credentials of the relevant staff member using 2-factor authentication. Given the low-risk nature of the data, we expect this to provide ample security. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? There will be no extra cost beyond the storage space that I have by default as a member of staff at KU Leuven. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project 4.

In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). institutional policies...). As is common in pure mathematics, the produced research articles will be permanently stored on the website arxiv.org. Every produced research article will also be permanently stored on LIRIAS, as I am obliged to do as an author affiliated to KU Leuven (as indicated here: https://www.kuleuven.be/open-science/what-is-open-science/scholarly-publishing-and-open-access/open-access-kuleuven/deposit-obligation). There will be no other project-related data to be retained or reused. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?

When will the data be made available? As soon as the data is produced (that is, when the first versions of the research articles are written), it will be uploaded both in .tex and .pdf files to the website arxiv.org. When the research articles will be peer-reviewed and published, they will be made available on the website LIRIAS, as per the KU Leuven deposit obligation.
