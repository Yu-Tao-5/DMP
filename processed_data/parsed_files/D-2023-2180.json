The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Bea Maes, orcid.org/0000-0002-5011-1134  \nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles\nProject number 1 & title Stress and stress regulation in children with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities\nFunder(s) GrantID 2G024323N\nAffiliation(s) X KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number. This question is optional. Applicants can only provide one project number.  2 Funder(s) GrantID refers to the number of the DMP at the funder(s), here one can specify multiple GrantIDs if multiple funding sources were used.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 3Please provide a short project description The project’s main aim is to unravel the role and mechanisms of stress regulation in children with \nprofound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD). First, the way in which these children experience \nsensory stimuli and respond to them, as well as how these contribute to their general stress level will be \nstudied. Secondly, it will be evaluated in which way high quality interactions which are attuned to the \nneeds of persons with PIMD can diminish their stress levels. The third aim is to test the association \nbetween stress levels and stress regulation on the one hand and the children’s general wellbeing, \nengagement and problem behaviours on the other hand. Data will be collected in 50 children with PIMD in  \nreal life situations. Data on environmental stimuli, staff’s interaction style and behavioural indicators of \nstress will be collected through continuous video observation, attaching two small cameras to the \nparticipant’s wheelchair and one bodycam. A physiological indicator of the child’s stress will be registered \nthrough the galvanic skin response with an Empatica E4 wristband. Wellbeing, engagement and problem \nbehaviour will be measured using questionnaires from the professional staff. More knowledge on this \ntopic can lead to the development of targeted interventions to reduce stress regulation problems in \npersons with PIMD and can give practitioners more insight in how to adapt the environment and their \ninteraction styles to accommodate the person’s stress levels.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

Video-observations will be imported and coded with Noldus Observer. Empatica physiological data will be analyzed by the software, offered by Empatica. The researcher and promotor are responsible for the data storage during the project. All digital data will be stored on a Bitlocker encrypted and password protected computer in the university’s secure environment (Onedrive for Business), with multifactor authentication for strictly confidential data. These data cannot be accessed or modified by unauthorized persons. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Storage capacity is standard 2 TB, which can be extended to 5 TB. If necessary extra costs will be paid by the project (this is foreseen). 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?No extra costs. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☐ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☒ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Data will be restricted to other master and PhD students and researchers that will work on the datasets during and after the project. All above described conditions will be preserved. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☒ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☒ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Other data repository (specify) ☐ Other (specify) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12When will the data be made available? ☐ Upon publication of research results ☒ Specific date (specify) ☐ Other (specify) At the end of the project Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT.
