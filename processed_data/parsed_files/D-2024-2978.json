The FWO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.  At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning.

This project capitalizes on a unique opportunity provided by a nature restoration project, where several clusters of new ponds are being created. From their creation onwards, all ponds will be subjected to detailed monitoring, including the quantification of abiotic conditions, community assembly through conventional and eDNA techniques, population assembly through genomics, and animal vector visits through camera trapping. In parallel, we will develop statistical methodology to comprehensively model evolving metacommunities and how alleles and species assemble through space and time. We will advance state-of-the-art Joint Species Distribution Models to simultaneously consider co-occurrence patterns in alleles and species, imperfect detection in metacommunity eDNA data, spatial pond connectivity through animal vectors, and the occurrence of legacy effects.
