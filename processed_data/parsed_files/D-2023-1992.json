Chemical data from experiments (reaction conditions, experimental sequence, observations, amount of reagents used) will be stored by the researcher in Microsoft OneDrive (2 TB), MBook ELN( Electronic Lab Notebooks) and analog lab notebooks. Corresponding structural identification data for the obtained compounds (raw and processed) will be uploaded in the ELN and linked to the correct experiment making data traceable. Biological data will include information on kinase inhibition and antiviral activity and will be preserved digitally and shared among all collaborators. All project data will be shared with the PI and other collaborators via Microsoft OneDrive and via the ELN. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.

STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: Metadata will be saved in the OneDrive storage and will be reported in the ELN. Filenames of the data generated (raw and processed) will be annotated in the ELN as well. 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? The active data used during the project will be will be stored by the researcher in Microsoft OneDrive (2 TB), MBook ELN(Electronic Lab Notebooks) and analog lab notebooks . Data that has to be actively used by KU Leuven or external collaborators will also be shared via Microsoft OneDrive. All project data will be shared with the PI and collaborators via Microsoft OneDrive and via the ELN. Biological data will include information on kinase inhibition and antiviral activity and will be preserved digitally as manuscripts, structure drawings, image files, and modelling information. Analog lab notebooks will be stored by the researcher during the project. Samples will be stored in the chemical inventory system . FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.For the active data, the data is automatically backed up via OneDrive. The electronic lab book provides a back-up for the analog lab notebooks and is backed-up automatically in the ELN's cloud service. The PI stores the paper copies of the analog lab notebooks and a scanned version in the online archival storage as PDF. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: KU Leuven OneDrive provides space of 2 TB which is regularly backed up and can be extended if needed. If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7OneDrive is not publicly accessible and password protected. Access needs to be granted by the researcher and will be limited to the PI (and his delegate responsible for data storage). For collaborations, accessibility to the relevant files will be granted if described in a non-disclosure agreement. Archival storage at KU Leuven is not publicly accessible and only people with permission (PI and his delegate responsible for data storage) can access the data. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?The use of OneDrive is free of charge if the capacity of 2 TB is not exceeded. Archival data storage is centrally offered via KU Leuven at 270 Euro/TB/Year. MBook ELN and the cloud service are offered by Mestrelab at 10 Euro/month for the subscription and a one-time license fee of 120 Euro. These costs are being covered by the general operating budget of the research group, or by the individual bench fee of researchers. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All data gathered by the researchers during the project that is stored in Microsoft Onedrive will be copied to archival storage rented at KU Leuven. The data stored in the MBook ELN remains accessible to the PI. The analog lab book will be stored in a physical archive. Samples will be stored for 10 years in our depository as long as the long-term stability and quantity of the compound allow it. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?The data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. The ELN data remains available to the PI via the cloud subscription to the ELN. All publications accompanied with the corresponding datasets will be deposited in LIRIAS. Also, the data that is disclosed in the supporting information of publications will be stored permanently. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Data archival at KU Leuven is currently offered at 270 Euro/TB/year. Since no large datasets are generated in this project, one TB of storage will be sufficient and the price for storage for 10 years is 2700 Euro. These costs are covered by the general operating budget of the research group or by the individual bench fee of researchers. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 136.
