How will the data be backed up? Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution Personal back-ups I make (specify below) During and after the research, all data will be stored on the online secured, safe platform of KU Leuven Sharepoint and via the personal network KU Leuven drive. The KU Leuven Sharepoint platform has sufficient storage to keep all the data that will be gathered during this Research Project. A standard back-up is provided by KU Leuven ICTS. In addition, a backup will be stored on the KU Leuven Onedrive. Personal back-ups will be made on the personal network drive (I-drive). Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, explain how this will be taken care of. Yes During and after the research, all data will be stored on the online secured, safe platform of KU Leuven Sharepoint and via the personal network KU Leuven drive. The KU Leuven Sharepoint platform has sufficient storage to keep all the data that will be gathered during this Research Project. A standard back-up is provided by KU Leuven ICTS. In addition, a backup will be stored on the KU Leuven Onedrive. Personal back-ups will be made on the personal network drive (I-drive). Backup occurs automatically, as the folders are synched. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Only the researchers involved in the project will have access to the secured KU Leuven server and as such the data. All researchers will work on a password protected computer of the KU Leuven. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? As only small datasets will be generated that can be stored (now and after the end of the project) on the online, free of charge platform of KU Leuven, Sharepoint, there will be no costs related to data storage. If deemed needed, extra storage can be bought (5GB for 39,80 euro), which can be paid from the C3 Project funds. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for 10 years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain below) All data will be preserved for 10 years (in line with KU Leuven RDM policy), except for the audio recordings of stakeholder interviews and focus group discussions. These will be deleted upon completion of the respective study. The transcripts from the recordings will be preserved for 10 years. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Other (specify below) All datasets will be stored on the online secured, safe platform of KU Leuven, Sharepoint. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? As only small datasets will be generated that can be stored on the online, free of charge platform of KU Leuven, Sharepoint, there will be no costs related to data storage. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 16 June 2023 6 of 8 Other (specify below) The data sharing possibilities will depend on the type of data gathered within the project. We distinguish between three types: - Personal data and interview/ focus group discussion transcripts will remain closed, as it can lead to stakeholder identification - Outcomes with potential for commercial valorization will not be made publicly available - Datasets that do not contain personal information and have no potential for commercial valorization will be made publicly available at the time of or after scientific publication (made available through a repository/or made available upon request). If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. The data access possibilities will depend on the type of data gathered within the project: - Personal data and interview/ focus group discussion transcripts: only involved researchers can access this data. - Outcomes with potential for commercial valorization: only involved researchers can access this data - Datasets that do not contain personal information and have no potential for commercial valorization: we strive to make these publicly available/no access restrictions (made available through a repository/or made available upon request). Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes, privacy aspects Yes, intellectual property rights Yes, ethical aspects The data access and sharing possibilities will depend on the type of data gathered within the project: - Personal data and interview/ focus group discussion transcripts: only involved researchers can access this data. --> restrictions due to privacy and ethical reasons - Outcomes with potential for commercial valorization: only involved researchers can access this data --> restrictions due to potential IPR - Datasets that do not contain personal information and have no potential for commercial valorization: we strive to make these publicly available/no access restrictions (made available through repository/or made available upon request). Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. KU Leuven RDR (Research Data Repository) Other (specify below) Audiofiles and transcripts will be stored on a KU Leuven sharepoint. Aggregated data resulting from the analysis of the data from audiofiles and transcripts will be made stored on personal protected computers of the researchers and made available via publications, meetings with stakeholders, experts, and conferences. All data will be stored and made available according to the conditions as approved by the ethics committee. When will the data be made available? Upon publication of research results Data will be analysed during the project duration, and aggregated results will be made public via scientific publications or conferences after conclusion of each individual study. Data sharing in this sense is not expected to be postponed for IP reasons. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. CC-BY 4.0 (data) Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) Other (specify below) For data that does not involve software source code, we will use a creative commons licence. For certain types of data, a data transfer agreement might be needed, to be discussed with LRD. For software, an appropriate license mechanism will be discussed with LRD. Do you intend to add a persistent identifier (PID) to your dataset(s), e.g. a DOI or accession number? If already available, please provide it here. No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 16 June 2023 7 of 8 Data will be shared via scientific publications or conferences. Publication of such data is in most cases associated with publication fees requested by publishers, ranging between 1500 euro - 3500 euro. Data shared via conferences requires researchers attending these events, which also generates costs, depending on the type of conference and place of the venue and length of stay. Costs associated with publications and conferences will be covered partly via the C3 budget, partly via other budgets.
