How will these costs be covered? The data storage of this project does not involve any costs. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? This project does not involve sensitive personal data, strictly confidential or confidential data. Namely, this project only works with nonconfidential data that can be accessed by whoever wants to have access to it. Hence, current storage suffices for any security concerns regarding data protection. 6.

What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered? There are no expected costs for data preservation. 7.

No Which data will be made available after the end of the project? No data will be made available after the end of the project. Given that the data is used to produce academic articles what will be available are the published articles that include - in different ways - the data. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? Upon request by mail Working documents might be shared if convenient via email exchange. When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results All relevant data available to the public will be part of published publications. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? Only people that request the data will have access and the (non-confidential) data they received will depend on what the researcher thinks is relevant to share (once again, I'm referring to reading notes and manuscripts) What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered? There will be no costs for data sharing. 8. Responsibilities Who will be responsible for data documentation & metadata? The main researcher of the project (me). Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project? The main researcher of the project (me). Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ? The main researcher of the project (me). Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP? The PI bears the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP.
