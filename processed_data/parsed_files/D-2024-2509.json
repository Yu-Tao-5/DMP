The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Hannelore Kemps 0000-0001-9248-1697\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Aernout Luttun (0000-0001-7902-9524) , supervisor\nProject number 1 & title 3M230218 - Unravelling the role of transcription factor Prdm16 in endothelial cells during the progression \nof ischaemic stroke.\nFunder(s) GrantID 21271824N\nAffiliation(s)  XKU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number. This question is optional. Applicants can only provide one project number.  2 Funder(s) GrantID refers to the number of the DMP at the funder(s), here one can specify multiple GrantIDs if multiple funding sources were used.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 3Please provide a short project description Ischaemic stroke is defined as a focal neurological deficit of vascular origin to the central nervous system.  \nDuring an ischaemic event, several cerebrovascular adaptations occur, including alterations in blood-brain  \nbarrier (BBB) permeability as well as recruitment and remodelling of collateral arteri(ol)es, which are both  \ndeterminant for stroke outcome. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern the maintenance  \nand function of both collateral arteri(ol)es and BBB capillaries upon cerebral ischaemia is crucial to establish  \nnew effective therapies. Recently, my host lab has found that transcription factor Prdm16 in arterial  \nendothelial cells supports arterial flow recovery during hind limb ischaemia by preserving their function. In  \nthis project, I will determine whether Prdm16 has a similar role during the progression of ischaemic stroke.  \nMy  preliminary  data  shows  a  protective  role  for  endothelial  Prdm16  on  ischaemic  stroke  lesion  \ndevelopment. I will first elucidate whether Prdm16 limits infarct growth by preserving collateral function  \nand/or BBB integrity upon cerebral ischaemia. Next, I will unravel the downstream targets that mediate the  \nprotective impact of endothelial Prdm16 during stroke. Finally, I will investigate the translational relevance  \nof targeting Prdm16 or its mediators upon ageing to improve cerebrovascular function following stroke.  \nAltogether, I expect that this project will lead to the identification of new treatment strategies for stroke  \npatients.\n2.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

Other  metadata  (on  quantification  \nprocedures, biochemical analysis,  etc.) are mostly captured manually and logged in lab notebooks or in  \nsearchable  Excel/Access  databases.  For  these  metadata,  we  will  progressively  design  own  metadata  \nstandards  using  http://dublincore.rog/ .  We  will  also  consider  archiving  our  data  using  general  data  \nrepositories (https://figshare.com/  and  https://zenodo.org/ ).

The FWO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.

FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 3Please provide a short project description Ischaemic stroke is defined as a focal neurological deficit of vascular origin to the central nervous system. During an ischaemic event, several cerebrovascular adaptations occur, including alterations in blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability as well as recruitment and remodelling of collateral arteri(ol)es, which are both determinant for stroke outcome. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern the maintenance and function of both collateral arteri(ol)es and BBB capillaries upon cerebral ischaemia is crucial to establish new effective therapies. Recently, my host lab has found that transcription factor Prdm16 in arterial endothelial cells supports arterial flow recovery during hind limb ischaemia by preserving their function. In this project, I will determine whether Prdm16 has a similar role during the progression of ischaemic stroke. My preliminary data shows a protective role for endothelial Prdm16 on ischaemic stroke lesion development. I will first elucidate whether Prdm16 limits infarct growth by preserving collateral function and/or BBB integrity upon cerebral ischaemia. Next, I will unravel the downstream targets that mediate the protective impact of endothelial Prdm16 during stroke. Finally, I will investigate the translational relevance of targeting Prdm16 or its mediators upon ageing to improve cerebrovascular function following stroke. Altogether, I expect that this project will lead to the identification of new treatment strategies for stroke patients. 2.Research Data Summary List and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .Main results and methods will be published in peer-reviewed journals (open access as required by FWO regulations) and all publications will be archived in Lirias, the digital KU Leuven document repository. All digital data generated in the project for each WP and associated metadata will be archived digitally and a searchable database format (Excel or Access) will be implemented. Electronic lab note books will be used and templates have been designed for writing protocols/SOPs, for excel spreadsheets for raw data and (statistical) analysis. When raw data are uploaded on repositories, keywords will be affixed along with readme files containing the needed information for reuse. In the final stage of the project, a master index file with the combined metadata for each WP will be generated and archived on a non-editable drive of the host institution KU Leuven (‘K drive’). All physical data collected during the course of the project will be stored at designated storage places (at room temperature or frozen) and location and preservation method of the biological samples (tissues, tissue sections, blood plasma, genetic material) will be documented digitally (.xlsx files). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.

STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: Metadata will be a combination of machine-generated and manually generated metadata. Metadata of raw images (file size, pixel number, acquisition date, settings, etc.) and qRT-PCR are captured automatically and saved on the server together with the corresponding data files. Other metadata (on quantification procedures, biochemical analysis, etc.) are mostly captured manually and logged in lab notebooks or in searchable Excel/Access databases. For these metadata, we will progressively design own metadata standards using http://dublincore.rog/ . We will also consider archiving our data using general data repositories (https://figshare.com/ and https://zenodo.org/ ). RNAseq data will be uploaded to the GEO repository which uses the MIAME standard. If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 144.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored?

If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data Digital data: The KU Leuven network servers allow for secure storage of data. The access to the KU Leuven server is u-number and password controlled. KU Leuven ICTS services provide the option to control data access for authorised persons only (in this case, KU Leuven affiliated research lab members involved in this project). All physical data, printed forms and notebooks are stored in the labs in locked cabinets. Access to the lab is secured and badge controlled. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Costs for digital data storage and back-up during the project have been included in the research budget of the project. The current cost rate for the KU Leuven network drives are: 52€/y/100Gb block (J) and 5.7€/y/100Gb block (K), 569.2€/y/5Tb block (L). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 165. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) All digital data and metadata will be retained for 10 years after the project (per the requirements of Research Data Management policy of the KU Leuven). The same term will be applied to physical data. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specify): For KU Leuven, digital data will be archived on the KU Leuven K drive for storage of read-only data. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?For KU Leuven, cost rate for storage on the K drive is 5.7€/year/100Gb. To store a total of 5 Tb for 10 years, the estimated cost hence is 2,850 €. Costs will be allocated to the project budget. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 176.
