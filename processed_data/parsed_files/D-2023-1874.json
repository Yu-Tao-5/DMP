Indeed, when customers interact with firms (i.e., service encounters) in various settings (e.g., hospitality,\nhealthcare, transport), they are increasingly confronted with services robots. Despite its importance, the role that service robots in service\nencounters can play is still in its infancy. Hence, this proposal is designed to better understand their role (1) in the absence versus\npresence of human employees, (2) in terms of service robots’ communication skills, and (3) in examining humans versus objects as\nrecipients of their service.\nResearch Design: Using experimental and field-data and different service robots (i.e., embodied robot, chatbot, and drone) a mixed-\nmethod approach with quantitative (i.e., structural equation modeling, text mining, single paper meta-analysis) and qualitative (i.e., fuzzy-\nset qualitative comparative analysis, interviews, observation) methods is proposed to unveil the impact of these service robot roles on\ncustomer outcomes (i.e., experience, engagement, and well-being).\nContributions & Relevance: The obtained insights will not only fill the gaps left unexplored in the literature, but our findings will also enable\nmanagers, technology developers, and policymakers to make better decisions about the role that service robots can play in order to boost\nfavorable customer outcomes.\n \n \nLast modified: \n30-04-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
