Yes, human subject data The survey regarding a Congolese village will entail questions about ethnic group, village of origin and birth, migration, politics and values. Those answers will have to be kept confidential. Therefore I will take the following steps: 1. Establish a clear data collection procedure and avoid collecting personally identifiable information 2. Educate myself on correct data handling procedures 3. Use strong authentication methods such as multi-factor authentication for accessing sensitive data 4. Encrypt survey data both during transmission and while stored on servers or local devices 5. Store survey data on secure servers Will you process personal data?

To ensure that the data I compile and process remains understandable and usable both during and after the research process, I will prioritize comprehensive and accessible documentation. Specifically, I will create detailed README.txt files to accompany each dataset, providing contextual information about the data sources, cleaning steps, merging procedures, variable descriptions, and any other relevant notes. Additionally, I will produce Codebook.tsv files wherever necessary to systematically describe the variables included in the merged database. These codebooks will include variable names, definitions, units of measurement, coding schemes, and any transformations applied. This documentation will be especially important for the database I am constructing for my research on the long-term impact of forced cotton policies in Congo. By maintaining clear, consistent, and standardized documentation practices, I aim to ensure that the dataset remains transparent and reusable for myself and other researchers in the future.
