It is based on the detection of shear waves that travel through the heart after for example mitral \nor aortic valve closure (MVC, AVC). The speed of these shear waves is directly dependent on myocardial \nstiffness. Since myocardial stiffness is dependent on both intrinsic properties and loading conditions of the \nheart, SWE could be valuable for evaluating processes that result in altered intrinsic myocardial properties,  \nsuch as scarring and fibrosis. With this project, we aim to explore the ability of SWE to evaluate myocardial  \nfibrosis and scar burden in two cardiac pathologies: left bundle branch block (LBBB) and aortic stenosis \n(AS). In both pathologies, fibrosis and scar burden play an essential role in disease progression and \nprognosis. Therefore, detection of changes in intrinsic myocardial properties with SWE might help to \nmonitor patients, determine the right point in time for an intervention or select suitable candidates for a \ntherapy. Furthermore, as myocardial stiffness is also dependent on loading, it is relevant to determine \nwhether an increased stiffness is the result of changes in the intrinsic properties of the myocardium or \nalterations in loading. Therefore, as a second part of this project, we aim the determine the effect of \naltered loading conditions on shear wave measurements.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

These servers are backed-up daily and only accessible \nwith permission. \nConventional echo images (not high frame rate) are stored on KWS, a digital platform where medical data \nof patients can be stored and accessed upon request. This platform is backed-up daily and medical data \ncan be stored there without extra cost (echo images are part of the medical record of the patients).  \nHow will the data be backed up?\nWHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO \nPREVENT DATA LOSS? ☐ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution\n☐ Personal back-ups I make\n☒ Other (specify): \nStandard back-up provided by UZ Leuven server and KWS platform\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 11Is there currently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.☒ Yes\n☐ No\nSpace on the UZ Leuven server is provided by the hospital. Hard disks are provided by the lab. If there isn’t  \nsufficient space, additional space can be requested.  \nIf no, please specify:  \nHow will you ensure that the data are securely \nstored and not accessed or modified by \nunauthorized persons?\nCLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, \nNETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND \nFILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND \nTRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. \nGuidance on security for research data  Access to data stored on the hospital servers is subject to the access rights management of the hospital.  \nAccess will be restricted to persons directly related to the study. The KU Leuven one drive is a personal drive,  \nprotected with two-factor authentication. The external hard drives and paper files containing study related  \ninformation will be locked in a separate cabinet within the Medical Imaging research Center with access for  \nthe persons directly related to the study.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?Data storage capacity including backup on hospital servers is available for a yearly fee of 200 EUR/TB. We \nexpect a total of close to 2 TB, in the end. Given the gradually increasing demands over the four years of \nthe project, we foresee ca. 1000 EUR in total covered by internal funding.  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 125. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five \nyears (or longer, in agreement with other \nretention policies that are applicable) after the \nend of the project? In case some data cannot be  \npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this  \n(e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\n Guidance on data preservation☐ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy\n☒ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with \nmedicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans\n☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain)\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long-term)?\nDedicated data repositories  are often the best place \nto preserve your data. Data not suitable for \npreservation in a repository can be stored using a KU  \nLeuven storage solution, consult the  interactive KU \nLeuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR\n☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes)\n☐ Shared network drive (J-drive)\n☒ Other (specifiy):\nAll digital data will be stored for 5 years after the end of the study on the UZ Leuven server, which is \nbacked-up daily. After 5 years, given the high cost of the storage and back-up, the data will be stored for \nlong-term on external hard drives. Each hard drive will contain a README-file specifying which data is \nsaved on the drive.  \nPhysical data  (questionnaires, ICF etc.) will remain stored in files in a cabinet in the lab for 25 years.  \nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during the expected retention \nperiod? How will these costs be covered?For the storage of the digital data ( ± 2TB) for 5 years on the UZ Leuven server, a total cost of ±2000 EUR \n(200 EUR/TB) is foreseen. This will be covered with internal funding. For the long-term storage of the data \non external disks, disks will be purchased. A disk of 2TB costs on average 150 EUR. Also this will be covered  \nwith internal funding.  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 136.

RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .All patients are assigned a unique code when they are added to the study database. This code will then be used as identifier when analyzing research data. Digital data: All digital files will be labelled and stored in a structured manner, e.g. each study has its own digital folder with subfolders containing raw and analysed patient data. Data from specific patients will be labelled with an unique identifier: e.g. patient 1 will be labelled SWE_AS_001, with SWE_AS acting as a study identifier and 001 as a patient identifier. A TXT or Microsoft Word file (README file) with a clear description of what a specific folder contains will be saved in each specific folder. Physical data: Physical data will be stored in different folders, organized for each study. In the beginning of each folder, a written paper is added that contains info on what is stored in this specific map. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: Medical images: All images used in our study will be saved in the conventionally-used DICOM format which contains metadata in the file header. This header contains key technical attributes of each specific file. In addition, each patient will have a specific folder carrying the specific patient code with all images. Other medical data: Metadata of other medical data e.g. questionnaires, ICF etc. will be labelled with the patients’ specific code. Numeric data: Metadata of numeric data (both raw and processed) e.g. any headers of XLS, TXT, CSV files used throughout the study, will be created manually in a descriptive and structured manner. Patient’s specific codes will be used when analyzing data. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 104.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data.☐ Shared network drive (J-drive ) ☐ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☒ Other: High frame rate ultrasound images will be stored on external hard drives, given the large size of the data. The drives are locked in cabinets in the lab and are only accessible for people involved in the study. A back-up of the high frame rate images will be made on the UZ Leuven hospital’s server (not the J-drive of KU Leuven) immediately after a patient is added. These servers are backed-up daily and only accessible with permission. Conventional echo images (not high frame rate) are stored on KWS, a digital platform where medical data of patients can be stored and accessed upon request. This platform is backed-up daily and medical data can be stored there without extra cost (echo images are part of the medical record of the patients). How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? ☐ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back-ups I make ☒ Other (specify): Standard back-up provided by UZ Leuven server and KWS platform FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No Space on the UZ Leuven server is provided by the hospital. Hard disks are provided by the lab. If there isn’t sufficient space, additional space can be requested. If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data Access to data stored on the hospital servers is subject to the access rights management of the hospital. Access will be restricted to persons directly related to the study. The KU Leuven one drive is a personal drive, protected with two-factor authentication. The external hard drives and paper files containing study related information will be locked in a separate cabinet within the Medical Imaging research Center with access for the persons directly related to the study. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Data storage capacity including backup on hospital servers is available for a yearly fee of 200 EUR/TB. We expect a total of close to 2 TB, in the end. Given the gradually increasing demands over the four years of the project, we foresee ca. 1000 EUR in total covered by internal funding. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 125. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☐ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☒ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): All digital data will be stored for 5 years after the end of the study on the UZ Leuven server, which is backed-up daily. After 5 years, given the high cost of the storage and back-up, the data will be stored for long-term on external hard drives. Each hard drive will contain a README-file specifying which data is saved on the drive. Physical data (questionnaires, ICF etc.) will remain stored in files in a cabinet in the lab for 25 years. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?For the storage of the digital data ( ± 2TB) for 5 years on the UZ Leuven server, a total cost of ±2000 EUR (200 EUR/TB) is foreseen. This will be covered with internal funding. For the long-term storage of the data on external disks, disks will be purchased. A disk of 2TB costs on average 150 EUR. Also this will be covered with internal funding. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 136.
