In addition, we provided proof of concept for a beneficial role of KE in remodeling of\nthe extracellular matrix (ECM), and in promoting post-exercise sleep, which are both central players in the adaptive response to exercise. Therefore,\nwe aim to elucidate whether KE, via these alterations, can beneficially impact the muscular and functional response to exercise training in well-trained\nindividuals. Given the pivotal role of muscle catabolism, capillary rarefaction, sleep disturbances, and ECM remodeling in the age-related decline of\nmuscular function and general health, we also aim to identify the effect of KE on the adaptive response to exercise training in older adults. In both work\npackages, we will provide an in-depth blueprint of the adaptations that occur in the skeletal muscle ECM as this is increasingly recognized to be a\ncentral regulator of muscular plasticity. As such, we aim to provide a detailed understanding of the effects of KE, exercise training, and aging on\nskeletal muscle ECM. This project will thus not only benefit athletes, but will also provide direct relevance for older adults, and will support the\ndevelopment of clinical trials in the context of dystrophic syndromes and other clinical models that are characterized by ECM dysregulations.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n14-03-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
