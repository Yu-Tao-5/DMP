Patients present with symptoms in the\nepigastrium, which include early satiation, postprandial fullness and epigastric pain or burning. Routine investigations including endoscopy are\nmacroscopically normal. Gastric abnormalities, including delayed emptying, gastric hypersensitivity and impaired accommodation, have been\nimplicated in symptom generation. Current treatment options target gastric function, but have limited efficacy. Recent studies have shown low-grade\nduodenal inflammation characterized by eosinophil and mast cell influx and impaired mucosal integrity in FD. We will investigate the link between\nduodenal immune activation on the one hand and gastric sensorimotor dysfunction and symptoms on the other hand. We will provide proof of concept\nfor the pivotal role of mast cells through a controlled trial with palmitoyletahnolamide, an endogenous mast cell stabilizing agent with lower levels in\nFD. We hypothesize that food is the trigger for activation of mast cells through a non-IgE-dependent pathway in the presence of impaired duodenal\nmucosal integrity. This will be studied in a sham-controlled dietary elimination trial of trigger nutrients, identified by duodenal confocal laser\nendomicroscopic evaluation of food allergies. If confirmed, our project will reshape the disease concept and management in this prevalent condition. \nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n02-07-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Patients present with symptoms in the epigastrium, which include early satiation, postprandial fullness and epigastric pain or burning. Routine investigations including endoscopy are macroscopically normal. Gastric abnormalities, including delayed emptying, gastric hypersensitivity and impaired accommodation, have been implicated in symptom generation. Current treatment options target gastric function, but have limited efficacy. Recent studies have shown low-grade duodenal inflammation characterized by eosinophil and mast cell influx and impaired mucosal integrity in FD. We will investigate the link between duodenal immune activation on the one hand and gastric sensorimotor dysfunction and symptoms on the other hand. We will provide proof of concept for the pivotal role of mast cells through a controlled trial with palmitoyletahnolamide, an endogenous mast cell stabilizing agent with lower levels in FD. We hypothesize that food is the trigger for activation of mast cells through a non-IgE-dependent pathway in the presence of impaired duodenal mucosal integrity. This will be studied in a sham-controlled dietary elimination trial of trigger nutrients, identified by duodenal confocal laser endomicroscopic evaluation of food allergies. If confirmed, our project will reshape the disease concept and management in this prevalent condition. Last modified: Last modified: 02-07-2024 Created using DMPonline.be.

Only members from the team have access to these folders. All ethical documents are available on the shared drive from the research groups involved. An overview of the samples stored in the biobank is available on the shared drive from our research group. For the microscopic image data that will be recorded: recording parameters (powers, excitation and emission wavelength), dimensions, image type, bit-depth, pixel sizes and microscope settings, will be stored. Either in a metafile accompanying the data (with identical filename) or embedded in the tiff header. The experimental protocols, stimulation settings, temperatures of the physiological experiments that will be performed during this projected will be described in detail in a lab book and referred in a ReadMe text file that will accompany the recorded data.

No Metadata standards are typically not used within our lab group. We do have a minimal set of requirements that will be followed in order to ensure standardization and possibility to reinterpret and reuse the data when necessary and permitted. For the microscopic imaging data we do adhere to metadata standards: Images will be stored in *.ome tiff format, which enables storing a multitude of microscope and recording parameters. For the more experimental imaging paradigms for which actual changes are made to the instrumentation, the metadata will be stored in accompanying txt or csv files. 3.

All generated data are stored on the shared network drive platforms of the KU Leuven and UZ Leuven that are only accessible to the members of the research teams (only for PhD, postdocs, technicians not for master students). Big files such as images are stored on the sharepoint online drives. Microscopy data: All original recordings and their metadata will be stored in one copy on external harddrives, which will be labeled by projectname, subproject, experiment, data and experimenter initials. The images that are judged of sufficient quality to derive conclusive data, will be analysed as saved on the researcher’s computer with a backup either on a local external harddrive or via the LUNA network.
