This storage space is safe\nand automatically backed-up, and allows for extra protection of sensitive data, such as Multi Factor Authentication and Conditional Access\nfunctions, so that the historical researcher alone can access the data before anonymisation. The data will be anonymised with Cubase,\ndistorting the voice and bleeping any identifiable information.\nS2A, S2B, S2C: The data of the current experiences (S2) will be stored at secure KU Leuven drives (I-/J-drive). After data collection, the data\nwill be pseudonymized by the doctoral researcher. The name of the participant will be coded by means of a unique, randomly generated code.\nSimilarly, other potentially identifying information (e.g.,names of places or relatives) will be replaced with a unidentifiable information (e.g.,\n“medium-sized city”; “older brother”).

J.Spilt & prof. K.\nLuyckx), so separated from the research data.

If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, explain how this will be taken care of. Yes The data will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic daily back-up procedures. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? S1A and S1B: Storage at the One drive cloud service provided by the Faculty of Arts (2 TB storage free of charge). This storage space is safe and automatically backed-up, and allows for extra protection of sensitive data, such as Multi Factor Authentication and Conditional Access functions, so that the historical researcher alone can access the data before anonymisation. The data will be anonymised with Cubase, distorting the voice and bleeping any identifiable information. S2A, S2B, S2C: The data of the current experiences (S2) will be stored at secure KU Leuven drives (I-/J-drive). After data collection, the data will be pseudonymized by the doctoral researcher. The name of the participant will be coded by means of a unique, randomly generated code. Similarly, other potentially identifying information (e.g.,names of places or relatives) will be replaced with a unidentifiable information (e.g., “medium-sized city”; “older brother”). The identification file that contains the unique code and name will be managed externally and is stored on aspecial encrypted disk that is managed by the database managers of the research unit SCenO – psychology (prof. J.Spilt & prof. K. Luyckx), so separated from the research data. The drive (CODES share) is provided by the IT service from the faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences and fulfills the conditions of the data management of the pseudonymised data. All audio recordings will be destroyed once the data is analysed. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? None: S1A, S1B: 2TB free of charge storage provided by the Faculty of Arts is enough for this project S2A, S2B, S2C: As stated above, we do not expect extra costs for data storage. In case we need to extend the storage capacity, costs will be covered by the credits of the supervisors and/or the bench fees from the PhD students.
