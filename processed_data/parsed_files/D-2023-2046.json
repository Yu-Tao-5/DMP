The DMP should not be submitted to FWO \nbut to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel.  Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.  \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation  Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives  of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions.

The diagnosis of allograft rejection relies on the \nhistological analysis of kidney biops ies, which at the University Hospital Leuven are performed at pre -\nestablished timepoints (3, 12 and 24 months after transplantation) and in case of any change in the clinical \nstatus of the patient.  The main objective  of the project is to improve the post -transplant monitoring of kidney \ntransplanted patients  by developing  a non-invasive biomarker  accurate enough to allow for stratification of \npatients  according to their individual risk of rejection, to help in the requ est and clinical interpretation of \nkidney biopsy and to guide the adaptation of the immunosuppressive strategy.  \nThis PhD project builds on a multidisciplinary collaboration between the Nephrology and Renal  \nTransplantation Research Group (Prof. Maarten Naes ens, supervisor) and the Laboratories for Cytogenetics \nand Genome Research (Prof. Joris Vermeesch, co -supervisor) and for Functional Epigenetics (Prof. Bernard \nThienpont, co -supervisor).  \nThe project is organized in three work packages (WP).  The first WP  is dedicated to  the development and \noptimization of new model to classify kidney transplanted patients with and without allograft rejection , via \nthe analysis of the epigenomic profile of plasma cfDNA. For this discovery phase, we opted for  a case -control \nstudy design, including  in total 150 plasma samples retrospectively selected  from our BIOBANK Renal \nTransplantation  (S53364 , clinicaltrials. gov NCT01331668) .  Each plasma cfDNA sample will be analysed  with \ntwo technical approaches in parallel: after enzymatic conversion of cfDNA (to allow the study of cfDNA \nmethylation), we will proceed with genome -wide low -coverage sequencing and with targete d sequencing \nfor specific regions of interest. For the targeted methylation sequencing approach, we have created (in \ncollaboration of the team of Prof. Thienpont) a unique set of genomic regions, including differentially \nmethylated regions between the diff erent cell -types involved in allograft rejection (tubular epithelial cells, \nkidney endothelial cells, immune cells), regions enriched for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  with \nhigh probability to carry heterologous alleles in donor and recipient, pro moter regions and gene bodies of \ngenes involved in inflammation and allograft rejection, and viral genome sequences.   \nThe selection of this regions of interest was based a publicly available methylation sequencing dataset \n(GSE186458 ) and on the data  of an ongoing study in our laboratory, focused on single -cell RNA sequencing \n(scRNAseq) of a unique set of 18 kidney transplant biopsies.  \nTo increase the accuracy  of our analysis of the genome -wide epigenomic profile of plasma cfDNA,  and adapt \nit to the k idney transplant cohort, in the first WP we will profile 10 biopsies with clear clinical phenotypes \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   4 \n (N=5 control biopsies; N=5 rejection biopsies collected in the BIOBANK Renal Transplantation S53364 of  \nUniversity Hospitals Leuven) using 10X Single Cell M ultiome ATAC + Gene Expression, to investigate  \nchromatin accessibility and to infer nucleosome positioning patterns of specific cell types in the kidney \nallograft. In the second WP, we will test the diagnostic performance of the newly developed biomarker for \ndiagnosis of allograft rejection in an independent validation cohort of 300 prospectively collected plasma \nsamples from kidney transplanted patients coming at University Hospital Leuven for the ir post-transplant \nfollow -up (plasma samples stored in the BIOBANK Renal Transplantation). Finally, the third work package will \nbe dedicated to the analysis of longitudinal plasma samples from (n=30) kidney transplanted patients with \ndiagnosis of rejection, in order to assess the value of our biomarker in predicti ng the onset of graft rejection.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   5 \n 2.

At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.

The diagnosis of allograft rejection relies on the histological analysis of kidney biops ies, which at the University Hospital Leuven are performed at pre - established timepoints (3, 12 and 24 months after transplantation) and in case of any change in the clinical status of the patient. The main objective of the project is to improve the post -transplant monitoring of kidney transplanted patients by developing a non-invasive biomarker accurate enough to allow for stratification of patients according to their individual risk of rejection, to help in the requ est and clinical interpretation of kidney biopsy and to guide the adaptation of the immunosuppressive strategy. This PhD project builds on a multidisciplinary collaboration between the Nephrology and Renal Transplantation Research Group (Prof. Maarten Naes ens, supervisor) and the Laboratories for Cytogenetics and Genome Research (Prof. Joris Vermeesch, co -supervisor) and for Functional Epigenetics (Prof. Bernard Thienpont, co -supervisor). The project is organized in three work packages (WP). The first WP is dedicated to the development and optimization of new model to classify kidney transplanted patients with and without allograft rejection , via the analysis of the epigenomic profile of plasma cfDNA. For this discovery phase, we opted for a case -control study design, including in total 150 plasma samples retrospectively selected from our BIOBANK Renal Transplantation (S53364 , clinicaltrials. gov NCT01331668) . Each plasma cfDNA sample will be analysed with two technical approaches in parallel: after enzymatic conversion of cfDNA (to allow the study of cfDNA methylation), we will proceed with genome -wide low -coverage sequencing and with targete d sequencing for specific regions of interest. For the targeted methylation sequencing approach, we have created (in collaboration of the team of Prof. Thienpont) a unique set of genomic regions, including differentially methylated regions between the diff erent cell -types involved in allograft rejection (tubular epithelial cells, kidney endothelial cells, immune cells), regions enriched for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with high probability to carry heterologous alleles in donor and recipient, pro moter regions and gene bodies of genes involved in inflammation and allograft rejection, and viral genome sequences. The selection of this regions of interest was based a publicly available methylation sequencing dataset (GSE186458 ) and on the data of an ongoing study in our laboratory, focused on single -cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of a unique set of 18 kidney transplant biopsies. To increase the accuracy of our analysis of the genome -wide epigenomic profile of plasma cfDNA, and adapt it to the k idney transplant cohort, in the first WP we will profile 10 biopsies with clear clinical phenotypes FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 4 (N=5 control biopsies; N=5 rejection biopsies collected in the BIOBANK Renal Transplantation S53364 of University Hospitals Leuven) using 10X Single Cell M ultiome ATAC + Gene Expression, to investigate chromatin accessibility and to infer nucleosome positioning patterns of specific cell types in the kidney allograft. In the second WP, we will test the diagnostic performance of the newly developed biomarker for diagnosis of allograft rejection in an independent validation cohort of 300 prospectively collected plasma samples from kidney transplanted patients coming at University Hospital Leuven for the ir post-transplant follow -up (plasma samples stored in the BIOBANK Renal Transplantation). Finally, the third work package will be dedicated to the analysis of longitudinal plasma samples from (n=30) kidney transplanted patients with diagnosis of rejection, in order to assess the value of our biomarker in predicti ng the onset of graft rejection.
