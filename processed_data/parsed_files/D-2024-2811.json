In regulations phrases are\nsometimes included such as the specific request for emulative detailing for the seismic design of\nprecast concrete structures (ACI 550.1R-09). On the other hand, it has been shown that the stability\nof concrete but also of steel-concrete structures, subjected to extreme loads (involving fire, fatigue\nand robustness items), is mainly determined by alternative load paths developed in the slabs.\nPrecisely these slabs are often executed as partly precast structures with critical joint details on\nwhich this research will focus. Detailing rules at the level of the interface will ensure composite\naction, which is essential for the structural behaviour, but also integrity is involved where elements\nare coupled.
