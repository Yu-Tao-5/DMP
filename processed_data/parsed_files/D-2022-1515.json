To fulfil these functions the\nmembranes of the ER physically connect with those of other organelles, like the mitochondria,\nthrough the agency of proteinaceous structures called membrane contact sites or MCSs. MCSs\nallow inter-organelle communication and are emerging as crucial signaling hubs for the spatial\nand temporal coordination of a variety of crucial cellular processes such as mitochondria\nbioenergetics and gene expression. However both the key molecular effectors of MCSs and their\nrole in the metabolism and function of T lymphocytes remains elusive. Our work revealed that\nPERK, a member of the unfolded protein response (UPR) elicited by loss of ER homeostasis, has\nadditional (UPR-independent) tethering functions, endorsing this protein kinase with the ability to\ncoordinate MCSs. Pilot experiments from our lab show that in T cells PERK shapes T cell\nmetabolism and effector functions. To unfold the role of PERK as MCSs effector of T cell biology,\nhere we will use state-of the art molecular/cellular biology tools, a recently developed\nmicrofluidics system and transgenic mice with a specific deletion of Perk in T cells as in vivo\nmodels to study its effects on anti-tumor immunity. We aim to define the relevance of PERK as\nmain metabolic checkpoint in T cells, a finding that may open new perspectives for T cell based\ntherapies.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNo\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nYes\nThe following ethical files partly cover this and all experimental approaches performed in mice\nare approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of KUL. ECD files: P185/2020 and P013/2021\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nYes\nWe do not exclude that the proposed work could result in research data with potential for tech\ntransfer and valorization. Ownership of the data generated belongs to KU Leuven and VIB in\naccordance with the framework agreement of both institutes. VIB has a policy to actively monitor\nresearch data for such potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly\nassessed, and in a number of cases the invention will be IP protected (mostly patent protection\nor copyright protection). As such the IP protection does not withhold the research data from\nbeing made public. In the case a decision is taken to file a patent application it will be planned so\nthat publications need not be delayed.\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\nNo third-party agreement restricts dissemination or exploitation of the data or strains generated\nfrom this project. In particular, existing agreements between VIB and KU Leuven do not restrict\npublication of data.\nThere is no IP on the generated strains that would prevent us from storing the strains,\nperforming the anticipated experiments or publishing the results.\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nData will be generated following standardized protocols. Metadata will be documented by the\nresearch and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in\nthe electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook) and in hard copy lab notebooks that refer to\nspecific datasets. \nCryotubes of biological samples (bacterial and yeast strains) stored at -80°C will be labelled with\na reference number that links to an entry in or strain database.\nAll datasets will be accompanied by a README.txt file containing all the associated metadata\n(see more details below).\nThe data will be generated following standardized protocols. Clear and detailed descriptions of\nthese protocols will be stored in our lab protocol database, and published along with the results.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 7\nMetadata will include the following elements:\n• Title: free text\n• Creator: Last name, first name, organization\n• Date and time reference\n• Subject: Choice of keywords and classifications\n• Description: Text explaining the content of the data set and other contextual information\nneeded for the correct interpretation of the data, the software(s) (including version number) used\nto produce and to read the data, the purpose of the experiment, etc.\n• Format: Details of the file format.\n• Resource Type: data set, image, audio, etc.\n• Identifier: DOI (when applicable)\n• Access rights: closed access, embargoed access, restricted access, open access.\nAdditionally, we will closely monitor MIBBI (Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical\nInvestigations) for metadata standards more specific to our data type.\nFor specific datasets, additional metadata will be associated with the data file as appropriate. \nThe final dataset will be accompanied by this information under the form of a README.txt\ndocument. This file will be located in the top level directory of the dataset and will also list the\ncontents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used. This will allow the data to\nbe understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for\nfuture reuse.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nDigital files will be stored on KU Leuven servers, except for private data that will be stored on KU\nLeuven secure server (digital vault).\n- Omics data: omics data generated during the project will either be stored on KU Leuven servers\nor on The Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC), initially in the staging area and later in the\narchive area. \n- Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each\nvector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock (-\n80°C). All published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the non-profit plasmid\nrepository Addgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request.\n- Cell lines: Newly created human cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid\nnitrogen storage and will be deposited in the UZ Leuven-KU Leuven Biobank. Other human cell\nlines will be stored locally in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory when actively used for\nexperiments. Animal cell lines will be stored in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory.\n- Bacterial and yeast strains will be stored in a -80°C freezer in the lab of Patrizia Agostinis. Costs\nare covered by general lab expenses.\n- Genetically modified organisms: Mice will be maintained in facilities of the Laboratory Animal\nCenter of KU Leuven, which applies Standard Operation Procedures concerning housing, feeding,\nhealth monitoring to assure consistent care in accordance with European and national\nregulations and guidelines. All animals will be registered in the Leuven Animal Information\nSystem (LAIS) database, along with corresponding genotyping information, ethical approval\ndocuments and animal provider receipts. \n- Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as\nappropriate.\n- Algorithms, scripts and softwares: All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software code driving\nthe project will be stored in a private online git repository from the GitHub account of the\ndepartment (https://github.com/vibcbd).\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nKU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme:\n- data stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all\nincremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are\nkept.\n- data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at\nmidnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept.\n- data stored on the digital vault is backed up using snapshot technology, where all incremental\nchanges in respect of the previous version are kept online. As standard, 10% of the requested\nstorage is reserved for backups using the following backup regime: an hourly backup (at 8 a.m.,\n12 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.), the last 6 of which are kept; a daily backup (every day) at midnight,\nthe last 6 of which are kept; and a weekly backup (every week) at midnight between Saturday\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 7\nand Sunday, the last 2 of which are kept.\n- All omics data stored on the Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC) will be transferred on a\nweekly basis to the archive area which is backed up.\nIncremental backups are done daily from one 20 TB QNAP NAS to a second 20 TB QNAP NAS.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThere is sufficient storage and back-up capacity on all KU Leuven servers:\n- the “L-drive” is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster\nwith NetApp eseries storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front-end.\n- the “J-drive” is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controlers with an Ontap 9.1P9 operating\nsystem.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nEach year €738 will be charged from our ICT service for the use of 5 TB on the L-drive (long term\nstorage) and €51,9 will be charged each year for the use of 100 GB of the J-drive (short term\nstorage). Back-up service is included in the price. For the K-drive (data archive) storage space of\n1 TB is foreseen and will cost €128 each year, this is also expandable in blocks of 100 GB. These\ncosts were foreseen in the application and if more the lab budget will be used to cover these\nexpenses.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nBoth the “L-drive” and “J-drive” servers are accessible only by laboratory members, and are\nmirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a\ncopy of the data can be recovered within an hour.\nAccess to the digital vault is possible only through using a KU Leuven user-id and password, and\nuser rights only grant access to the data in their own vault. Sensitive data transfer will be\nperformed according to the best practices for “Copying data to the secure environment” defined\nby KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the\napplication of upgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and\nonly ICTS personnel (bound by the ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. A\nsecurity service monitors the technical installations continuously, even outside working hours.\nAll private data will be rendered anonymous before processing outside the digital vault. Only the\nPI will be granted access to the server to deposit private data. The PI will be the only responsible\nfor linking patient information, survey data and/or tissue samples, and will strictly respect\nconfidentiality. All de-identified data will be exported from the database by the PI, and stored on\nKU Leuven servers from where it can be accessed by the research and technical staff from the\nlaboratory. \n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nThe minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all\ndatasets. All datasets will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic back-up\nprocedures for at least 5 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. The costs (€156 per TB per\nyear for “Large volume-storage” ) will be covered by the lab.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nAs a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing\nplatforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of\npublication.\nFor all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows:\n-Digital datasets: files will be stored on the “L-drive”.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n5 of 7\n-Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory.\n-Omics data: datasets will be stored on the “L-drive” or, for larger datasets, on the Vlaams\nSupercomputer Centrum.\n-Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each\nvector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock (-\n80°C).\n-Cell lines: human cell lines will be stored in the UZ Leuven Biobank (-80°C). Human pluripotent\nstem cell lines generated during this project will be deposited in hPSCreg. Animal cell lines will be\nstored in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory.\n-Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as\nappropriate.\n- Following publication, the results associated with each study will also be deposited in the Dryad\nrepository, where they will be preserved indefinitely.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nEach year €128 will be charged from our ICT service for the use of 1 TB on the k-drive (long term\nstorage), back-up service is included in the price. These costs were foreseen in the budget\nrequest of the application and if more, the lab budget will be used to cover these expenses.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nNo\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nParticipants to the present project are committed to publish research results to communicate\nthem to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made\nopenly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to\npublication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new\ncollaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. negative data).\nWe aim at communicating our results in top journals that require full disclosure upon publication\nof all included data, either in the main text, in supplementary material or in a data repository if\nrequested by the journal and following deposit advice given by the journal. Depending on the\njournal, accessibility restrictions may apply.\nBiological material will be distributed to other parties if requested.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn an Open Access repository\nOther (specify):\nUpon request by email\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nAs a general rule all research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at the time of\npublication. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, potential\nIP requirements – note that patent application filing will be planned so that publications need not\nbe delayed - or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be\nmade publicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached.\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nWhenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available\nthrough repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain\nsufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse, and will be conform to community\nnorms. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative\nCommons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication, a Creative Commons\nAttribution (CC-BY) or an ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer\nagreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly,\nand they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. For\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n6 of 7\ndata shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if\napplicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse\nthat are permitted.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nIt is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g.\nfor metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by\nusing free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data\nmanagement costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. A budget for publication costs has\nbeen requested in this project.\n8. Responsibilities\nWho will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?\nMetadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection\nand analysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook) that\nrefer to specific datasets. The data will be reviewed by the principal investigator.\nWho will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nThe research and technical staff will ensure data storage and back up, with support from Raf De\nCoster for the KU Leuven drives.\nWho will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ?\nThe PI is responsible for data preservation and sharing, with support from the research and\ntechnical staff involved in the project, and from Raf De Coster for the KU Leuven drives.\nWho bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nThe PI bears the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n7 of 7"

Legal and ethical issues Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for Research and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). Be aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation. No Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant ethical review committee(s) Yes The following ethical files partly cover this and all experimental approaches performed in mice are approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of KUL. ECD files: P185/2020 and P013/2021 Does your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted? Yes We do not exclude that the proposed work could result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorization. Ownership of the data generated belongs to KU Leuven and VIB in accordance with the framework agreement of both institutes. VIB has a policy to actively monitor research data for such potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of cases the invention will be IP protected (mostly patent protection or copyright protection). As such the IP protection does not withhold the research data from being made public. In the case a decision is taken to file a patent application it will be planned so that publications need not be delayed. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place? No No third-party agreement restricts dissemination or exploitation of the data or strains generated from this project. In particular, existing agreements between VIB and KU Leuven do not restrict publication of data. There is no IP on the generated strains that would prevent us from storing the strains, performing the anticipated experiments or publishing the results. 4. Documentation and metadata What documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this project? Data will be generated following standardized protocols. Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook) and in hard copy lab notebooks that refer to specific datasets. Cryotubes of biological samples (bacterial and yeast strains) stored at -80°C will be labelled with a reference number that links to an entry in or strain database. All datasets will be accompanied by a README.txt file containing all the associated metadata (see more details below). The data will be generated following standardized protocols. Clear and detailed descriptions of these protocols will be stored in our lab protocol database, and published along with the results. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used. If no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse. No This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 3 of 7 Metadata will include the following elements: • Title: free text • Creator: Last name, first name, organization • Date and time reference • Subject: Choice of keywords and classifications • Description: Text explaining the content of the data set and other contextual information needed for the correct interpretation of the data, the software(s) (including version number) used to produce and to read the data, the purpose of the experiment, etc. • Format: Details of the file format. • Resource Type: data set, image, audio, etc. • Identifier: DOI (when applicable) • Access rights: closed access, embargoed access, restricted access, open access. Additionally, we will closely monitor MIBBI (Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations) for metadata standards more specific to our data type. For specific datasets, additional metadata will be associated with the data file as appropriate. The final dataset will be accompanied by this information under the form of a README.txt document. This file will be located in the top level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used. This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse. 5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project Where will the data be stored? Digital files will be stored on KU Leuven servers, except for private data that will be stored on KU Leuven secure server (digital vault). - Omics data: omics data generated during the project will either be stored on KU Leuven servers or on The Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC), initially in the staging area and later in the archive area. - Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock (- 80°C). All published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request. - Cell lines: Newly created human cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid nitrogen storage and will be deposited in the UZ Leuven-KU Leuven Biobank. Other human cell lines will be stored locally in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory when actively used for experiments. Animal cell lines will be stored in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory. - Bacterial and yeast strains will be stored in a -80°C freezer in the lab of Patrizia Agostinis. Costs are covered by general lab expenses. - Genetically modified organisms: Mice will be maintained in facilities of the Laboratory Animal Center of KU Leuven, which applies Standard Operation Procedures concerning housing, feeding, health monitoring to assure consistent care in accordance with European and national regulations and guidelines. All animals will be registered in the Leuven Animal Information System (LAIS) database, along with corresponding genotyping information, ethical approval documents and animal provider receipts. - Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate. - Algorithms, scripts and softwares: All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software code driving the project will be stored in a private online git repository from the GitHub account of the department (https://github.com/vibcbd). How is backup of the data provided? KU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme: - data stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept. - data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept. - data stored on the digital vault is backed up using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. As standard, 10% of the requested storage is reserved for backups using the following backup regime: an hourly backup (at 8 a.m., 12 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.), the last 6 of which are kept; a daily backup (every day) at midnight, the last 6 of which are kept; and a weekly backup (every week) at midnight between Saturday This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 4 of 7 and Sunday, the last 2 of which are kept. - All omics data stored on the Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC) will be transferred on a weekly basis to the archive area which is backed up. Incremental backups are done daily from one 20 TB QNAP NAS to a second 20 TB QNAP NAS. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes There is sufficient storage and back-up capacity on all KU Leuven servers: - the “L-drive” is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster with NetApp eseries storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front-end. - the “J-drive” is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controlers with an Ontap 9.1P9 operating system. What are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these costs be covered? Each year €738 will be charged from our ICT service for the use of 5 TB on the L-drive (long term storage) and €51,9 will be charged each year for the use of 100 GB of the J-drive (short term storage). Back-up service is included in the price. For the K-drive (data archive) storage space of 1 TB is foreseen and will cost €128 each year, this is also expandable in blocks of 100 GB. These costs were foreseen in the application and if more the lab budget will be used to cover these expenses. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Both the “L-drive” and “J-drive” servers are accessible only by laboratory members, and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. Access to the digital vault is possible only through using a KU Leuven user-id and password, and user rights only grant access to the data in their own vault. Sensitive data transfer will be performed according to the best practices for “Copying data to the secure environment” defined by KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of upgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound by the ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. A security service monitors the technical installations continuously, even outside working hours. All private data will be rendered anonymous before processing outside the digital vault. Only the PI will be granted access to the server to deposit private data. The PI will be the only responsible for linking patient information, survey data and/or tissue samples, and will strictly respect confidentiality. All de-identified data will be exported from the database by the PI, and stored on KU Leuven servers from where it can be accessed by the research and technical staff from the laboratory. 6. Data preservation after the FWO project Which data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...). The minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets. All datasets will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic back-up procedures for at least 5 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. The costs (€156 per TB per year for “Large volume-storage” ) will be covered by the lab. Where will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)? As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of publication. For all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows: -Digital datasets: files will be stored on the “L-drive”. This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 5 of 7 -Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory. -Omics data: datasets will be stored on the “L-drive” or, for larger datasets, on the Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum. -Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock (- 80°C). -Cell lines: human cell lines will be stored in the UZ Leuven Biobank (-80°C). Human pluripotent stem cell lines generated during this project will be deposited in hPSCreg. Animal cell lines will be stored in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory. -Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate. - Following publication, the results associated with each study will also be deposited in the Dryad repository, where they will be preserved indefinitely. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered? Each year €128 will be charged from our ICT service for the use of 1 TB on the k-drive (long term storage), back-up service is included in the price. These costs were foreseen in the budget request of the application and if more, the lab budget will be used to cover these expenses. 7. Data sharing and reuse Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? No Which data will be made available after the end of the project? Participants to the present project are committed to publish research results to communicate them to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made openly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new collaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. negative data). We aim at communicating our results in top journals that require full disclosure upon publication of all included data, either in the main text, in supplementary material or in a data repository if requested by the journal and following deposit advice given by the journal. Depending on the journal, accessibility restrictions may apply. Biological material will be distributed to other parties if requested. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? In an Open Access repository Other (specify): Upon request by email When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results As a general rule all research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at the time of publication. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, potential IP requirements – note that patent application filing will be planned so that publications need not be delayed - or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be made publicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse, and will be conform to community norms. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication, a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) or an ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. For This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 6 of 7 data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered? It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. A budget for publication costs has been requested in this project. 8. Responsibilities Who will be responsible for data documentation & metadata? Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook) that refer to specific datasets. The data will be reviewed by the principal investigator. Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project? The research and technical staff will ensure data storage and back up, with support from Raf De Coster for the KU Leuven drives. Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ? The PI is responsible for data preservation and sharing, with support from the research and technical staff involved in the project, and from Raf De Coster for the KU Leuven drives. Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP? The PI bears the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP.
