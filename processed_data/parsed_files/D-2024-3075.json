The\nuse of martensitic alloys is a recent innovative, but widely unexplored approach in this regard. In contrast to conventional ceramic and\nmetallic materials for thermal expansion management, the expansion behavior of martensitic titanium alloys can be controlled in a wide\nrange by adjusting alloy content, phase composition and crystallographic texture.
