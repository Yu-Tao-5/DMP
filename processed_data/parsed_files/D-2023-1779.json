The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the offi cial start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not b e submitted to FWO \nbut to the research co-ordination office of the hos t institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random ch eck.  \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project ; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal.  This DMP may of course have been updated since its  first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by t he relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted wi thin the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Fl anders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish R esearch Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which co mprises representatives of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous F WO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning. To incre ase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary  of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following \nlink .   \n      \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  2 \n 1.

Approaches such as Universal Design (UD), Inclusive Design (ID), or Design for All (DfA ) intend \nto respond to this challenge. However, their uptake  has been limited in architectural practice. UD/ID/ DfA \nare often critiqued for being prescriptive, disrega rding individual differences and particularities, o r lacking \nadequate formats to inform designers about the latt er. Inspired by these critiques, this study focuses  not \non what sets people apart (their differences or par ticularities), but rather on similarities or overla ps, i.e. \nresonances, across them, and how these can help des igners address the challenge in inclusive designing . It \nbreaks new ground by making explicit aspects of UD/ ID/DfA that remain implicit. In doing so, it addres ses \ntwo important questions: why inclusive designing ma tters (motivation) and how to make information on \nhuman diversity accessible for designers (understan ding). First, a set of resonance principles are dev eloped \nby studying overlaps between diverse people; what b uilt environments afford and mean to them. Second, \nthe project tests the principles’ applicability and  what effects they produce (e.g. regarding understa nding \nand/or motivation) in selected architecture firms. Ultimately, resonance principles will become a desi gn-\noriented framework aiding designers to develop skil ls needed on how to design for a diverse population .  \n                \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  4 \n 2.

The FWO project ‘Similarity in Difference’ is plann ing to re-use datasets generated by researchers of \nResearch[x]Design (RxD), a research group that is c o-chaired by the supervisor of the project at issue , Prof. \nAnn Heylighen. All datasets are currently stored on a password pro tected KU Leuven server the supervisor has access t o: \nSET-DEP-ARCH-LEU-AIDA-Projects-AE0008. Datasets wil l be re-used only with explicit permission of the \nsupervisor, and under her supervision. Ethical prov isions (e.g. privacy issues, storage, or re-use) of  each \ndataset will be carefully read and taken into accou nt before using, analysing, or disseminating about them. \n                                                        \n5 These data are generated by combining multiple exi sting datasets. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  8 \n Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data  (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, please describe these issues further and refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. ☒ Yes, human subject data \n☐ Yes, animal data \n☐ Yes, dual use  \n☐ No \n If yes, please describe:  The project consists of a series of case studies wh ich involve, for instance, interviewing human being s. \nEthical clearance will be obtained from the KU Leuv en Social and Societal Ethics Committee (SMEC). I w ill \ndraw up and provide to participants a by the SMEC a pproved informed consent form ICF that participants  \nwill read and sign in case of agreement. If signed on paper: the original documents will be kept under  lock. \nIf signed digitally: they will be stored on one of KU Leuven password protected servers.

If so, briefly \ndescribe the kind of personal data you will use. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. If available, add the reference to your file in your host institution's privacy register. ☒ Yes \n☐ No \nIf yes:   Short description of the kind of personal data that  will be used:  \n Data collection will be limited to what is strictly  necessary for the research at hand: participants’ \nexperiences of built environments, their needs and preferences. During the implementation phase of thi s \nproject, insight will be sought on participants’ pr ofessional experiences as a designer, their positio n within \na design firm, and their professional activities. T hese data will be obtained by means of (1) the publ ic \ndomain (e.g. internet, and/or libraries/archives), and (2) ethnographic fieldwork: document analysis, \ninterviewing, and observation.    Privacy Registry Reference:   A PRET application will be submitted prior to data collection. An informed consent form (ICF) is drawn  up \nthat all participants will read, sign, and submit t o the researchers in this study (myself and supervi sor). The \nICF will outline the possibility to pseudonymise pa rticipants' names if they wish to. Likewise, the \nparticipants of the study will choose whether or no t personal data (raw and/or processed) may be re-us ed \nin future (RxD) projects. In any case, personal dat a will remain accessible to the supervisor of the s tudy; \nshe will be responsible for the safe storage of the  datasets after completion of the study. She will d ecide \nhow long data will be stored and where in the long term, as data may be relevant for (her) future rese arch. \nIn the event data are reused, this will be done on the conditions approved by the SMEC and complying \nwith participants' explicit instructions (included in the written form in the ICF document). \n  \n                                                        \n6 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan   \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  10 \n Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)?  If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☒ Yes \n☐ No \n If yes, please comment:   While the aim of this project is to share its resul ts as much as possible – especially with a view tow ards \nbuilding a more inclusive society, there might be s ituations in which commercial valorization will be \nsought. For instance, oftentimes designers seek for  research-based advice on how to make their project s \nmore inclusive. These designers may find consulting  with RxD as a competitive advantage in their work.  \nHence, potential commercial valorization is linked to operationalizing research results in design prac tice.  \n Additionally, to protect this project’s  outcome (R esonance Principles), obtainment of intellectual pr operty \nwill be considered.  \n \nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)?  If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. ☐ Yes \n☒ No \n If yes, please explain:   n/a  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  11 \n Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use?  If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. ☒ Yes \n☐ No \n If yes, please explain:   Where it concerns testing and studying the applicat ion of the resonance principles in architectural \npractice, documents may be produced by designers wh ich are subject to intellectual property rights. Th ese \ndocuments may only be used/published with explicit – written and oral – permission of their authors.  \nWritten permission will be stored in one of KU Leuv en password protected servers in .pdf format. All \n(published) design media will be referenced to thei r author/original source. \n   \n3.  Documentation and Metadata \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  12 \n Clearly describe what approach will be followed \nto capture the accompanying information \nnecessary to keep data understandable and \nusable , for yourself and others, now and in the \nfuture (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and \ntypes required, procedures used, Electronic Lab \nNotebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. \nwhere this information is recorded).  \n 1. With regard to reference data (e.g. literature) that will be collected, documents will be stored in  zotero \n(on a KU Leuven computer), which keeps track of sou rces and date of inclusion. Metadata regarding wher e \nreference data were found will be included in the z otero file(s).  \n2. With regard to document inventory of data found independently: a readme file will be drawn up that \nkeeps track of where information was found (e.g. li nks to internet pages, scanned articles, design med ia \netc). \n3. With regard to raw data: multimedia files will b e accompanied by a readme file that outlines who \ncollected/recorded data, as well as other contextua l factors (e.g. where they were collected, when, wh o \nelse was present, unexpected events). Where it appl ies, I will clearly differentiate between raw and \nprocessed data. \n4. With regard to personal/observational notes: not es and observations (and interpretations thereof) w ill \nbe clearly distinguished from raw data. I will incl ude a note on authorship in the personal notes. \n5. With regard to (follow-up) e-mails, they will be  stored in a separate folder. Outlook automatically  \nassigns dates, names, and e-mail addresses to them.  If additional information on email exchange is \nneeded, I will add so in a readme file. \n6. With regard to processed data, the data manageme nt tool Nvivo aids in keeping track of, and \norganizing, metadata and link them to (raw) data. A  guide will be drawn up that will enable someone el se \nto follow the logic in how data have been stored, p rocessed and/or analysed. Following the QUAGOL \nguidelines, content reports, concept lists and them e charts will be drawn up, which aid the analysis \nprocess. All reports will be included in the Nvivo file, and dates will be added. The full names of th e \nresearchers who are involved in this process will b e included in case they need to be tracked down for   \nclarification/verification.  \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  13 \n Will a metadata standard be used to make it \neasier to find and reuse the data ?  \n \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard \nwill be used. If not, please specify which \nmetadata will be created to make the data \neasier to find and reuse.  \n \nREPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERT AIN \nFORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. \nSTANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . \n ☐ Yes \n☒ No \nIf yes, please specify (where appropriate per datas et or data type) which metadata standard will be us ed:  \n \nn/a \n \nIf no, please specify (where appropriate per datase t or data type) which metadata will be created:  \n \nIn the context of the research group the project in scribes itself in (RxD), steps have been taken duri ng \n2020 and 2021 to build up an inventory with differe nt data sets, attaching keywords and categories to \neach of them. As the present study progresses, as w ell as in its completion, I will order and categori ze the \ndata sets according to how the group has done it. T his way data sets will be findable, accessible, and  \nreusable. \nWhere it concerns camera captures, video- or audio- recordings, a readme file will be added outlining t he \nbasic features of the device (e.g. brand or when it  was purchased (if known)) and/or other contextual \nfactors considered relevant. For some recording dev ices, a metadata file is created automatically. The  \nmetadata file will be stored on the same folder as the recording(s). For safety and ethical reasons, \nrecordings will not be stored in the device itself,  but on one of KU Leuven's password protected serve rs (I \nand/or J Drive). \nAt the end of each fieldwork (or whenever it is est eemed that a significant amount of data has been \ncollected), I will create a data spread sheet that will subsequently be transferred/added to the resea rch \ngroup's data inventory file. This process will aid making the data findable, accessible, interoperable , and \nreusable - according to the FAIR principles. \nData sets will be made identifiable by attaching si mple and clear names to files and folders. If proce ssed, \nthe file's name will contain the initials of the re searchers’ who processed it. The last version of a document \n(in case there are multiple of a kind) will be clea rly indicated through its name and location in a sp ecial \nfolder.  \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  14 \n 4.  Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project \n \nWhere will the data be stored? Data will be stored on one of KU Leuven password protected servers with  automatic back-up procedures \non a daily basis. In RxD, researchers have access t o a personal drive (I Drive) and a shared drive (J Drive). \nOnly selected team members have access to the latte r. Data will be stored in both drives as an additio nal \nbacking-up method.  \n \nHow will the data be backed up?  \nWHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO \nPREVENT DATA LOSS ? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS , STORAGE MEDIA AND \nPROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKIN G UP \nDIGITAL AND NON -DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH .7 \n \nREFER TO INSTITUTION -SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP \nPROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE . \n See previous point.  \n                                                        \n7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Ru bric:  https://osf.io/2z5g3/  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  15 \n Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.  ☒ Yes \n☐ No \nIf yes, please specify concisely:  There is currently sufficient storage & backup capa city.  \nOn the JDrive (shared drive), each user gets 50 GB of free storage available as part of the service co st to \nthe Department of Architecture. On the IDrive (pers onal drive) each user gets 350 GB.  \nIt can be extended if needed for the project.  If no, please specify:   n/a  \nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?  \nCLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , \nNETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND \nFILES ) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND \nTRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 7 \n Personal data will be stored on one of KU Leuven se rvers for the duration of the project and beyond*, in \naccordance with KU Leuven RDM policy. ICTS personne l at KU Leuven grants access to KU Leuven servers \nonly with explicit permission from the supervisor. This way, data confidentiality and security is prov ided.  \n For the duration of the project I will be responsib le for data management and keeping the database up to \ndate: Natalia Pérez Liebergesell (natalia.perezlieb ergesell@kuleuven.be). All requests, incidents, upd ates, \netc. will be managed by me during this period, with  input from the supervisor.  \n*After completion of the project, the supervisor wi ll continue managing the data: Prof. Ann Heylighen \n(ann.heylighen@kuleuven.be).   No additional resources or measures are foreseen to  be necessary at this moment. This may be re-\nevaluated in the coming months and/or after complet ion of the study, with input from the supervisor. \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  16 \n What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Costs for data storage and backup are covered by th e Department of Architecture at the KU Leuven. The \ncost for standard volumes of data (mentioned above)  are included in the administrative costs budgeted \nfor this project. Only in case a research project i nvolves big (> 1TB) data volumes, there will be an extra \ncost involved, but this is currently not expected f or this project. \n \n \n  \n5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project \n \nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this  (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). The supervisor of this project will judge and selec t data she considers relevant to keep in the long t erm \n(10+ years) for potential re-use in future projects  she/RxD is involved in. The richness of this kind of \nqualitative data makes them potentially relevant fo r follow-up research projects. \n \nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? As mentioned in a previous point: After completion of the project, the supervisor wil l continue managing the data: Prof. Ann Heylighen \n(ann.heylighen@kuleuven.be) until her retirement (1 0+ years). Data will be stored on a password \nprotected KU Leuven server.  \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?  Costs for data preservation during the retention pe riod are covered by the Department of Architecture at \nthe KU Leuven.   \n   \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  17 \n 6.

    "clean_full_text": "FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 1 FWO DMP Template - Flemish Standard Data Management Plan Project supervisors (from application round 2018 on wards) and fellows (from application round 2020 onw ards) will, upon being awarded their project or fellowship, be invited to develop their answers to the data management related questions in to a DMP. The FWO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the offi cial start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not b e submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the hos t institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random ch eck. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project ; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by t he relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted wi thin the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Fl anders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish R esearch Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which co mprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous F WO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning. To incre ase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link .

Approaches such as Universal Design (UD), Inclusive Design (ID), or Design for All (DfA ) intend to respond to this challenge. However, their uptake has been limited in architectural practice. UD/ID/ DfA are often critiqued for being prescriptive, disrega rding individual differences and particularities, o r lacking adequate formats to inform designers about the latt er. Inspired by these critiques, this study focuses not on what sets people apart (their differences or par ticularities), but rather on similarities or overla ps, i.e. resonances, across them, and how these can help des igners address the challenge in inclusive designing . It breaks new ground by making explicit aspects of UD/ ID/DfA that remain implicit. In doing so, it addres ses two important questions: why inclusive designing ma tters (motivation) and how to make information on human diversity accessible for designers (understan ding). First, a set of resonance principles are dev eloped by studying overlaps between diverse people; what b uilt environments afford and mean to them. Second, the project tests the principles’ applicability and what effects they produce (e.g. regarding understa nding and/or motivation) in selected architecture firms. Ultimately, resonance principles will become a desi gn- oriented framework aiding designers to develop skil ls needed on how to design for a diverse population .

PHYSICAL VOLUME : PLEASE ESTIMATE THE PHYSICAL VOLUME OF THE RESEARCH MATERIALS (FOR EXAMPLE THE NUMBER OF RELEVANT BIOLOGICAL SAMPL ES THAT NEED TO BE STORED AND PRESERVED DURING THE PROJECT AND /OR AFTER ). If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type. The FWO project ‘Similarity in Difference’ is plann ing to re-use datasets generated by researchers of Research[x]Design (RxD), a research group that is c o-chaired by the supervisor of the project at issue , Prof. Ann Heylighen. All datasets are currently stored on a password pro tected KU Leuven server the supervisor has access t o: SET-DEP-ARCH-LEU-AIDA-Projects-AE0008. Datasets wil l be re-used only with explicit permission of the supervisor, and under her supervision. Ethical prov isions (e.g. privacy issues, storage, or re-use) of each dataset will be carefully read and taken into accou nt before using, analysing, or disseminating about them. 5 These data are generated by combining multiple exi sting datasets. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 8 Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, please describe these issues further and refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. ☒ Yes, human subject data ☐ Yes, animal data ☐ Yes, dual use ☐ No If yes, please describe: The project consists of a series of case studies wh ich involve, for instance, interviewing human being s. Ethical clearance will be obtained from the KU Leuv en Social and Societal Ethics Committee (SMEC). I w ill draw up and provide to participants a by the SMEC a pproved informed consent form ICF that participants will read and sign in case of agreement. If signed on paper: the original documents will be kept under lock. If signed digitally: they will be stored on one of KU Leuven password protected servers. All documents signed on paper will be digitalized and equally sto red on the KU Leuven server. In case findings are disseminated, written and oral permission will be o btained by all the participants of the study. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9 Will you process personal data 6? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. If available, add the reference to your file in your host institution's privacy register. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes: Short description of the kind of personal data that will be used: Data collection will be limited to what is strictly necessary for the research at hand: participants’ experiences of built environments, their needs and preferences. During the implementation phase of thi s project, insight will be sought on participants’ pr ofessional experiences as a designer, their positio n within a design firm, and their professional activities. T hese data will be obtained by means of (1) the publ ic domain (e.g. internet, and/or libraries/archives), and (2) ethnographic fieldwork: document analysis, interviewing, and observation. Privacy Registry Reference: A PRET application will be submitted prior to data collection. An informed consent form (ICF) is drawn up that all participants will read, sign, and submit t o the researchers in this study (myself and supervi sor). The ICF will outline the possibility to pseudonymise pa rticipants' names if they wish to. Likewise, the participants of the study will choose whether or no t personal data (raw and/or processed) may be re-us ed in future (RxD) projects. In any case, personal dat a will remain accessible to the supervisor of the s tudy; she will be responsible for the safe storage of the datasets after completion of the study. She will d ecide how long data will be stored and where in the long term, as data may be relevant for (her) future rese arch. In the event data are reused, this will be done on the conditions approved by the SMEC and complying with participants' explicit instructions (included in the written form in the ICF document). 6 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10 Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please comment: While the aim of this project is to share its resul ts as much as possible – especially with a view tow ards building a more inclusive society, there might be s ituations in which commercial valorization will be sought. For instance, oftentimes designers seek for research-based advice on how to make their project s more inclusive. These designers may find consulting with RxD as a competitive advantage in their work. Hence, potential commercial valorization is linked to operationalizing research results in design prac tice. Additionally, to protect this project’s outcome (R esonance Principles), obtainment of intellectual pr operty will be considered. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: n/a FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11 Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please explain: Where it concerns testing and studying the applicat ion of the resonance principles in architectural practice, documents may be produced by designers wh ich are subject to intellectual property rights. Th ese documents may only be used/published with explicit – written and oral – permission of their authors. Written permission will be stored in one of KU Leuv en password protected servers in .pdf format. All (published) design media will be referenced to thei r author/original source. 3. Documentation and Metadata FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12 Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). 1. With regard to reference data (e.g. literature) that will be collected, documents will be stored in zotero (on a KU Leuven computer), which keeps track of sou rces and date of inclusion. Metadata regarding wher e reference data were found will be included in the z otero file(s). 2. With regard to document inventory of data found independently: a readme file will be drawn up that keeps track of where information was found (e.g. li nks to internet pages, scanned articles, design med ia etc). 3. With regard to raw data: multimedia files will b e accompanied by a readme file that outlines who collected/recorded data, as well as other contextua l factors (e.g. where they were collected, when, wh o else was present, unexpected events). Where it appl ies, I will clearly differentiate between raw and processed data. 4. With regard to personal/observational notes: not es and observations (and interpretations thereof) w ill be clearly distinguished from raw data. I will incl ude a note on authorship in the personal notes. 5. With regard to (follow-up) e-mails, they will be stored in a separate folder. Outlook automatically assigns dates, names, and e-mail addresses to them. If additional information on email exchange is needed, I will add so in a readme file. 6. With regard to processed data, the data manageme nt tool Nvivo aids in keeping track of, and organizing, metadata and link them to (raw) data. A guide will be drawn up that will enable someone el se to follow the logic in how data have been stored, p rocessed and/or analysed. Following the QUAGOL guidelines, content reports, concept lists and them e charts will be drawn up, which aid the analysis process. All reports will be included in the Nvivo file, and dates will be added. The full names of th e researchers who are involved in this process will b e included in case they need to be tracked down for clarification/verification. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERT AIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per datas et or data type) which metadata standard will be us ed: n/a If no, please specify (where appropriate per datase t or data type) which metadata will be created: In the context of the research group the project in scribes itself in (RxD), steps have been taken duri ng 2020 and 2021 to build up an inventory with differe nt data sets, attaching keywords and categories to each of them. As the present study progresses, as w ell as in its completion, I will order and categori ze the data sets according to how the group has done it. T his way data sets will be findable, accessible, and reusable. Where it concerns camera captures, video- or audio- recordings, a readme file will be added outlining t he basic features of the device (e.g. brand or when it was purchased (if known)) and/or other contextual factors considered relevant. For some recording dev ices, a metadata file is created automatically. The metadata file will be stored on the same folder as the recording(s). For safety and ethical reasons, recordings will not be stored in the device itself, but on one of KU Leuven's password protected serve rs (I and/or J Drive). At the end of each fieldwork (or whenever it is est eemed that a significant amount of data has been collected), I will create a data spread sheet that will subsequently be transferred/added to the resea rch group's data inventory file. This process will aid making the data findable, accessible, interoperable , and reusable - according to the FAIR principles. Data sets will be made identifiable by attaching si mple and clear names to files and folders. If proce ssed, the file's name will contain the initials of the re searchers’ who processed it. The last version of a document (in case there are multiple of a kind) will be clea rly indicated through its name and location in a sp ecial folder. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Data will be stored on one of KU Leuven password protected servers with automatic back-up procedures on a daily basis. In RxD, researchers have access t o a personal drive (I Drive) and a shared drive (J Drive). Only selected team members have access to the latte r. Data will be stored in both drives as an additio nal backing-up method. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS , STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKIN G UP DIGITAL AND NON -DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH .7 REFER TO INSTITUTION -SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE . See previous point. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Ru bric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 15 Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: There is currently sufficient storage & backup capa city. On the JDrive (shared drive), each user gets 50 GB of free storage available as part of the service co st to the Department of Architecture. On the IDrive (pers onal drive) each user gets 350 GB. It can be extended if needed for the project. If no, please specify: n/a How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES ) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 7 Personal data will be stored on one of KU Leuven se rvers for the duration of the project and beyond*, in accordance with KU Leuven RDM policy. ICTS personne l at KU Leuven grants access to KU Leuven servers only with explicit permission from the supervisor. This way, data confidentiality and security is prov ided. For the duration of the project I will be responsib le for data management and keeping the database up to date: Natalia Pérez Liebergesell (natalia.perezlieb ergesell@kuleuven.be). All requests, incidents, upd ates, etc. will be managed by me during this period, with input from the supervisor. *After completion of the project, the supervisor wi ll continue managing the data: Prof. Ann Heylighen (ann.heylighen@kuleuven.be). No additional resources or measures are foreseen to be necessary at this moment. This may be re- evaluated in the coming months and/or after complet ion of the study, with input from the supervisor. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 16 What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Costs for data storage and backup are covered by th e Department of Architecture at the KU Leuven. The cost for standard volumes of data (mentioned above) are included in the administrative costs budgeted for this project. Only in case a research project i nvolves big (> 1TB) data volumes, there will be an extra cost involved, but this is currently not expected f or this project. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). The supervisor of this project will judge and selec t data she considers relevant to keep in the long t erm (10+ years) for potential re-use in future projects she/RxD is involved in. The richness of this kind of qualitative data makes them potentially relevant fo r follow-up research projects. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? As mentioned in a previous point: After completion of the project, the supervisor wil l continue managing the data: Prof. Ann Heylighen (ann.heylighen@kuleuven.be) until her retirement (1 0+ years). Data will be stored on a password protected KU Leuven server. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Costs for data preservation during the retention pe riod are covered by the Department of Architecture at the KU Leuven. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 17 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available.
