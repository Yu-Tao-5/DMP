Although successful,  \nthere are significant risks associated with implantation such as insertion trauma, foreign body reaction (FBR) and  \npathogen infection resulting in inflammation and reduced or loss of device function. Equipping neural implants with  \nan additional biosensing functionality for inflammatory markers would give valuable information on the local implant  \nenvironment, allowing for early diagnostics and guided drug treatment. Although several sensing principles have  \nbeen demonstrated for relevant molecules in vitro, the transition to in vivo situations has been halted due to  \nbiofouling and stability issues. In this project, we will develop electrochemical sensing functionalities for different  \ninflammatory markers such as hydrogen peroxide, pH, Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and Interleukin 6 (IL-6) with  \nsuitable  properties  towards  implantation.  We  will  improve  the  long  term  stability  and  sensitivity  through  \nincorporating antifouling zwitterionic polymers and using more suitable biorecognition elements (enzyme-free  \nnanocatalysts, aptamers instead of antibodies for IL-6 and TNF-α). These sensors will be extensively characterized in  \nvitro with model fluids and inflammatory cell culture models and if successful in vivo with a gerbil cochlea model.\nInstitution: KU Leuven\nDMP_1S647622N_Jolan_Wellens Page 2 of 71.
