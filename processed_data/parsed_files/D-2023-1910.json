The maps render \npeople on the move as invaders which shapes public discourse and justifies harsh migration policies of \nexclusion [Van Houtum, 2012]. Cartography is, in this instance, used to support a repressive power that \ndeprives people of fundamental rights and citizenship. Simultaneously, several artists have created maps \nwhich interrupt hegemonic cartography’s iconography and representation of people on the move; it is an \nemergent field of artistic counter-cartographies. By presenting migrant journeys with the tool that shaped \nnations and notions of citizenship, any map of people on the move participates in the ongoing negotiation \nof access to fundamental rights, citizenship, and/or legal protection. The proposed research aims to \ninvestigate how counter-maps of people on the move produce images of communities with equal access \nto fundamental rights, raise political awareness of inclusivity, and promote civil engagement [Van Gelder, \n2021; on photography]. I will revise the notion of cartography as a tool of the powerful to show how \ncounter-maps perform the histories of those cartography has been used to render weak and \nsubaltern.Therefore, I ask how we can recognise the latent power in artistic counter-maps to present \npeople on the move as worthy of fundamental rights by investigating the potential histories these images \nperform against the grain of hegemonic cartography.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3.Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded).I will provide specific information through the file and folder naming (date, name of the author, title etc.). For data collected from external sources, I will save the documents of the sources in pdf when present in the electronic version, or photograph the sources. I will also create a README.txt to summarize the collected contents and their organization in a folder structure. The README.txt file contained in a local hard drive of my private computer, as well as on OneDrive, based on the template README.txt provided by research support staff at KU Leuven, adapted to the needs of my project. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: I will use the Dublin Core metadata standard. I will add metadata to references using Zotero (for textual sources) and Tropy (for images). I will sort each file based on the following categories: primary sources (archives, interviews, recorded data, photographs, field notes), secondary sources (books, articles, images) and add metadata including name of the author(s), date, title, place as well as thematic tags allowing to connect the file with one or more areas of my research . If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? I will store all the data on OneDrive cloud service provided by KU Leuven, as well as on my personal computer hard drive. I will also use an external hard drive for extra backup and long-term preservation, which will be encrypted FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.All the data will be backed up online: on cloud OneDrive (with the automatic update every day) as well as on a physical external hard drive (every 2 months). Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: All the data will be backed up online: on cloud OneDrive (with the automatic update every day) as well as on a physical external hard drive (every 2 months). If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7The data stored on my private computer are secured with the password to open the device - I am the only one who has access to that computer. Regarding the cloud storage, following the security protocols, I will change the password of the cloud service every three months. I will use encrypted archives for long-term preservation. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?The hard drive will be covered by my grant, and costs between 50-100 EUR. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 115. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All data will be retained for at least 5 years Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?Core data will be stored online in a dedicated academic data repository. Following the preservation procedures, I will also store the data on a backup hard drive that will stay at the offices of my research unit at KU Leuven, at the Lieven Gevaert Centre, for ten years after the completion of the PhD. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?KU Leuven uses ‘Archive storage’ which I will purchase storage at €75 a year for 5 years, using the funds from the bench fee. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 126. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☐ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: I am willing to share the collected data in academic repositories such as Zenodo. I will seek the advice of research support staff/IT support staff/legal support staff towards the end of my research to find the best available solution. After completion of the PhD, I plan to share edited and selected data in publications (either a monograph or peer-reviewed articles). If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Data relating to interviewees will require specific restrictions in the sharing phase. Only the versions authorized by the artist will be shared (as a transcription). The multimedia footage created by me during those interviews (video or/and audio) cannot be shared with other researchers and the public unless I give the consent. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.I will opt to publish any articles in Gold OA. I have already searched for OA journals which do not charge author fees in DOAJ and within visual arts field I have found various options, so I believe that such a publication will be possible. If not, I will opt for a Green OA. When publishing my datasets or results at a data repository, I will opt for Zenodo. When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.Upon publication of research results. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 Sharable data from the project is made available using a creative commons license. 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes: What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Some journals might require an author’s fee to make the data available, I will pay this fee with my grant 7.
