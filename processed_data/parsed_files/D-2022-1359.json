By combining both historical\nand anthropological approaches, it will critically analyze and evaluate the interactions of\nmultifaceted postwar Flemish/Belgian civil society with Muslim communities of Moroccan and\nTurkish descent since the 1960s. The research team seeks to highlight and understand the\nmultifold entanglements between the countryâ€™s social organizations, NGOs, religious\ninstitutesâ€¦ and the growing communities of 'guest workers' from the Muslim world, experiences\nthat would fundamentally impact their identity, agency and discourses. By interweaving research\non migration with that on civil society we aim to analyze the different and evolving ways in which\nmany different actors within the Flemish/Belgian â€˜middenveldâ€™ since the 1960s, and those\nwith a religious identity in particular, voiced the social deprivation of these communities, worked\ntowards their empowerment and intensely interacted with the emerging migrant self-\norganizations. Together they did not only develop and â€˜negotiateâ€™ a more or less coherent\n'common discourse' that urged public opinion to show and practice solidarity with the\nnewcomers, but also experienced important changes.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Add the reference to the file in KU Leuven's Record of Processing Activities.\nBe aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNo.\nThis project is focused on historical / archival research. \nThe interviews planned within Negotiating Solidarity are historic elaborations on publicly\navailable data, articles, organizational workings and policy. As such, they are concerned with\nhistoric data within the public sphere, rather than with personal data.\n3.2. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s).\nNo\n3.3.

Documentation and metadata\n4.1. What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of the\ndata collected/generated in this project?\n1. Research methods for the interviews will be documented as word files, as well as a blank copy\nof the informed consent form. Details on the setting of the interviews, the selection of interview\ntopics and the list of questions for the semi-structured interviews will be documented in word.\nInterviews from research projects conducted at KADOC are treated as oral history archival units\nand are stored in KADOC's digital repository (Teneo). A subject list is compiled for each interview,\nin some cases a full transcription will be made. A contract with the people interviewed specifies\nthe terms under which the interview can be used for academic purposes and by possible third\nparties.\n2. A README.txt file contained on the KADOC shared\nserver \nQ:\\04_Onderzoek\\04_02_Projecten\\NegotiatingSolidarity\n  will be added, based on the\ntemplate provided by the research support staff of KU Leuven and adapted to the needs of the\nproject team . In order improve the accessibility of the divergent work packages and their data,\nseveral additional README.txt files will be added at the appropriate levels of the project file\nstructure.\n3. The biographical and organizational data will be stored in and made available for re-\nuse through the \nODIS-database\n, a core research facility of KU Leuven. \n4. The most important deliverables generated by the project, in casu the doctoral dissertation\nand the other scientific publications, should be self-evident for researchers in the fields\nconcerned.\n4.2. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be\nused. If not, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nODIS applies repeatable field groups and directional input, systematised by means of\nvalidated vocabularies and thesauri. The data-structures are based on international standards,\ne.g. ISAAR(CPF) for biographical, family and organisational/institutional data, ISAD(G) for the\ndiscription of archives/archival units, ISBD for publications, Docomomo for buildings, ..... The\nrelational field groups of ODIS allow to create clear and univocal links between records. The lists\nof relational attributes are also based on international standards. \n5. Data storage and backup during the project\n5.1. Where will the data be stored?\nWord documents, pictures, recordings of interviews and other basic data generated by the\nproject will, as a rule, be stored on the network servers of KADOC. This Centre disposes of an ICT\ndepartment with its own infrastructure, including a trusted digital repository (Teneo). A time\nstamped master copy of the data will be kept there. Copies can made and kept on personal\ndevices.\nFor some materials, the OneDrive provided by KU Leuven will provide some extra flexibility in\nconsulting and handling frequently used materials.\nDe biographical and organizational data generated by the project will be stored in ODIS. This\nweb-database is hosted by ICTS KU Leuven. The agreement provides for the use of three blade\nservers, a primary storage capacity of 1 TB and for mirroring. The interfaces of ODIS are\nmanaged and maintained in close consultation with LIBIS KU Leuven. \n5.2. How will the data be backed up?\nThe servers of KADOC are backuped on a weekly basis. Its digital repository, hosted by ICTS KU\nLeuven, provides all the necessary procedures (backup and mirroring) for durably storing digital\nassets. The ODIS database enjoyes similar hosting facilities from ICTS-KU Leuven. \n5.3. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nKADOC's network servers and digital repository have ample storage space and\nbackup facilities. ODIS provides for a primary storage capacity of 1 TB which is amply sufficient.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 5\n5.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nAs the project is hosted by KADOC KU Leuven, the data generated by the project are considered\npart of its overall digital holdings. No data storage and backup costs will be charged. The use of\nODIS (and its storage capacity) is covered by the general user agreement of KADOC with  this\nresearch facility.\n5.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not\naccessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nThe project folders on the network servers of KADOC can only be accessed by staff members,\nthose on One Drive only by the dedicated researchers. .\nThe data-series created by the project in ODIS are attributed to a specific project-\nusergroup. Only the members of the project team can access and change them. \n6. Data preservation after the end of the project\n6.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the\nproject? If only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is\nthe case (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll of the research datasets, materials used to produce them and their metadata will be stored\nalong with the main deliverables of the project. There are no reasons to deviate from the\nprinciple of preservation of data for the minimal term of 5 years.\n6.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)?\nThe main deliverables of the project and the research datasets and materials used to produce\nthem, together with their metadata, will be centralized, stored and managed using the long-term\ndigital preservation repository of KADOC-KU Leuven and its digital assets management system\nTeneo, supported by the curation services of LIBIS-KU Leuven. This infrastructure guarantees the\nsafe storage of data with back-ups in a redundant environment. Teneo archives and provides\npersistent access to born-digital or digitised data objects and datasets and includes metadata,\nusage policies, upload\nand access tools. \nBiographical and  organizational data-series generated by the project will be durably stored in\nthe ODIS database.\n6.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How\nwill the costs be covered?\nAs the project is hosted by KADOC-KU Leuven, the mid- and long-term preservation of its data (in\nTeneo and ODIS) will fall under the general responsibility of this archival institution. The costs are\ncovered by the general budget of KADOC as the size of these datasets remains relatively low.\n7. Data sharing and re-use\n7.1. Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data\n(e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions or because of IP\npotential)?\nNo.\nIn general there are no restrictions.\nPublicly available biographical data on living persons gathered by the project in ODIS will only be\nmade available to third parties given their explicit and formal consent.\nThe interviews conducted by the project team will be treated by KADOC as archival\nunits. Participants are introduced to and accept the terms of the interview and the way in which it\nis processed and used for academic purposes, following the elaborate KADOC  procedures.The\nconservation and consultation of these interviews and transcripts will as such be subject to the\nconditions set in the contract between KADOC, the researcher and the interviewee. Interviews\nand transcripts will  only be available to other persons  under the conditions stipulated in this\nagreement. The standard  procedure requires their prior written consent. \n7.2. Which data will be made available after the end of the project?\nThe doctoral dissertation, the scientific publications\nThe policy recommendations\nThe project's metadata, biographical and organisational data-series in particulier. \nThe interviews. \nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 5\n7.3. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn an Open Access repository\nIn a restricted access repository\n1. The biographical and organizational data will be made consultable in ODIS, with the exception\nof data on living persons.\nOther project metadata, will be made accessible in Teneo.\n2. The interviews and their transcriptions and be consulted in the KADOC reading room, after\nprior consent by the interviewee (cfr. contract).\n3. The doctoral dissertation, the policy recommendations and scientific publications will be\naccessible through the KADOC's \ncatalogues\n \n7.4. When will the data be made available?\nImmediately after the end of the project\nUpon publication of the research results\nThe data will be made available after the end of the project. \nAdditionally, the data of the project will be stored and managed using Teneo and made available\nafter the project through KADOC's \ncatalogues\n  and other online instruments (e.g. the HeReDi-\nplatform on heritage, religion and diversity) all this according the general conditions of\naccessibility handled by the Centre.\nThe term of the contract concluded with the interviewees will determine their accessibility (cfr.\nsupra). \n7.5. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nThe data will be made available to everyone through the \ncatalogues\n  of KADOC KU Leuven\n(Teneo, Limo, ODIS) under its general rules & conditions of accessibility (cfr. supra).\nThe ODIS-database will thoroughly renewed over the coming years. The system will be linked to\nKU Leuven's RDR, allowing research teams to store their time-stamped and LIRIAS-referenced\ndata-sets in this repository and from their on also on other platforms (e.g. Zenodo). \nThese same data-sets will also remain accesible in ODIS where other research teams can further\nre-use and complement them. In ODIS they also remain accesible to the general public, as the\ndatabase applies a \nCC BY-NC-SA license. \n7.6. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nNone. As a heritage organization with archival holdings, recognized and subsidized by the\nFlemish government, KADOC doesn't charge user fees to those wanting to consult the (analogue\nand digital) materials that it keeps and discloses. The storage and exploitation costs of its\ncatalogues and (digital) repositories are covered by regular subsidies.\n8. Responsibilities\n8.1. Who will be responsible for the data documentation & metadata?\nThe PhD-researcher and the post-doc researcher connected to the project, in close consultation\nwith their promotors and with KADOC's head of Research. \n8.2.
