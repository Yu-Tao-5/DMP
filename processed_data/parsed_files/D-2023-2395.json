Although  worldwide a lot of research efforts focus on \nestimating cardiac morphological and functional parameters in an accurate and robust  manner, little attention has \nbeen given to aid the clinician in further  interpreting the obtained measurements. Nevertheless, it is well  recognized \nthat these data sets are complex and hard to interpret even by experts.\nWithin this project, we will take advantage of state-of-the-art machine  learning methodologies in order to develop a \ntool that can support  the physician in interpreting echocardiographic data and therefore  guide the decision-making \nprocess. More specifically, we will extract  information on local cardiac function and shape – after correcting  them for \nconfounding factors such as age or gender and determine  their (individual and joint) added prognostic power. As first \napplication domains, we will predict the risk of developing future cardiac disease  on the one hand and the response to  \nbiventricular pacemaker  therapy in heart failure patients on the other.  \n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Disk storage costs 1200 Euro/Tb/year in our hospital (backed-up). For 2000 echo studies @400Mb/study this adds up to about 0.8Tb to be stored for 3y. The FWO scholarship covered these costs. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS.

Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☒ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify: Patient dataset such as Doppler CIP and Intervendor In vivo Dataset are not to be share as they contain personal information Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☒ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Other data repository (specify) ☐ Other (specify) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10When will the data be made available? ☐ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☒ Other (specify) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED.

If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☒ My dataset already has a PID ☐ No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? NA 7.
