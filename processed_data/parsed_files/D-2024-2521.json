The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Igor Steve BECKERS (ORCID 0000-0002-4363-4893)\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Dirk De Vos (supervisor) (ORCID 0000-0003-0490-9652)\nProject number 1 & title 1291724N\nFunder(s) GrantID 2CROSS-COUPLING OF DIVERSIFIED C(SP3) FRAGMENTS WITH (HETERO)ARYL HALIDES BY UPGRADING PD \nCATALYSIS WITH THE ORGANOCATALYTIC ACTIVATION OF AMINO ACIDS\nAffiliation(s) ☐ KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\nPlease provide a short project description    -  -           The success of Pd catalyzed crosscoupling reactions in drug discovery has led to a large\n  -  -      .  share of one and twodimensional drug scaffolds among pharmaceutical compounds This\n  -    .   ,   leaves the threedimensional medicinal compounds underexplored In this project we will\n      -  -     tackle this issue by enabling the Pdcatalyzed crosscoupling of pharmaceutically relevant\n( )     -  ( 3) .     hetero aryl halides with amino acid derived C sp fragments An innovative approach will\n :           be investigated by combining the Pd catalysis with the organocatalytic decarboxylation or\n   ,       ( 2)- ( 3) deprotonation of amino acids potent nucleophiles will be generated for C sp C sp\n    .        coupling in a convergent manner The optimal combination of organocatalyst and Pd\n            catalyst will be discovered using a research methodology that goes beyond the\n   .        conventional screening of catalysts Aided by fundamental understanding of the reaction\n (   ,  ,      - mechanism via kinetic experiments computational modelling advanced XAS on the Pd K\n     13   15    ), -  edge and NMR spectroscopy with C and N labelled amino acids structure activity\n             relationships of the organocatalyst will be obtained via the thoughtful variation of its\n . molecular structure\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): Upon termination of the contract, the data will be transferred and stored on an external hard drive (Samsung Portable SSD T5 1 TB), managed by Annelies Van Vlasselaer What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?The high capacity of the available external hard drive (1 TB) enables the preservation of data from multiple terminated or finished projects. Currently, an average of 15 GB is used for the finished projects of each user, which allows to divide its cost over approximately 60 users. Given the cost of the available hard drive of 120 EUR, the expected costs are negligible. The involved IT-expenses are included in the project’s consumable expenses or covered by reserve funds. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 106. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☐ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☒ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Upon publication of the research results, the associated datasets will be made available upon reasonable request. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☒ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify: Unpublished data (GC/HPLC/NMR data, output of DFT calculations, data analysis and publications drafts) with prospect on publication will only be shared internally to maximize chances on impactful publication FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Other data repository (specify) ☒ Other (specify): Upon reasonable request via e-mail When will the data be made available? ☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. Check the RDR guidance on licences for data and software sources code or consult the License selector tool to help you choose. ☐ CC-BY 4.0 (data) ☐ Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) ☐ MIT licence (code) ☐ GNU GPL-3.0 (code) ☒ Other (specify) Only uses for research purposes will be allowed and commercial reuse will be excluded. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☒ No All relevant data will be provided upon publication, either in the main text or in supporting information What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? No additional costs are expected as the data can be shared via the already budgeted storage cloud from Box. If additional costs would occur they will be covered from reserve funds. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 127.
