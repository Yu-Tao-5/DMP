Polyamide membranes\nhave been the state of the art for 40 years, but have failed to expand to new application fields\ndue to their limited chemical stability. A new generation of chemically robust, salt-rejecting\nmembranes is thus highly desired for applications in harsh aqueous media (e.g., oxidizing, acidic,\nand caustic conditions, solvent-containing waters, and cleaning products). The key objective of\nthis postdoc is to take advantage of the high chemical resistance of epoxide-based polymers to\nfabricate the first water purification membranes offering both high salt selectivity and excellent\nchemical robustness. Recently, the applicant synthesized the first epoxide-based membrane\nusing interfacial polymerization. Here, epoxide interfacial polymerization will be developed as a\nnovel platform chemistry for membrane synthesis by investigating innovative polymerization\nconditions and \nstrategies, establishing membrane synthesis-property-performance relationships,\nand elucidating ion transport mechanisms. These fundamental insights combined with the high\nversatility of epoxide chemistry will yield tailor-made membranes that will be tested for\nchallenging applications, such as the desalination of chlorine-containing sea waters, and the\nselective removal of rare earth metals from acid mine effluents.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
