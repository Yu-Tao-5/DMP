However, I am required to inform KU Leuven about the\ncollaboration with ITAW, Sealcentre Pieterburen, and Sea Life Blankenberge, providing details about\nthe research plan and its ethical considerations, as detailed below:\nThe Institute for Terrestrial and Aquatic Wildlife Research (ITAW), led by co-supervisor Dr. Kristina\nLehnert, catches free-ranging seals twice yearly in the frame of a health monitoring of the Schleswig-\nHolstein government. Harbour seals are examined clinically, samples of blood, saliva, hair and rectal\nswabs are taken. ITAW is experienced in this work and has the necessary permits to carry out the\nseal catch, and sampling described in the project. ITAW is in possession of national permits from the\nMinistry for Energy Transition, Climate Protection, Environment and Nature (MEKUN) of Schleswig-\nHolstein, as well as a University’s ethical approval (V312-72241.121-19 (70-6/07)).\nThe seal catch for rectal swabs has been designed with the 3R principle of replacement, reduction\nand refinement. The lowest manageable number of seals needed to produce meaningful results and\nsolid data from a statistical perspective are being sampled (reduction). The catching action and\nsubsequent sampling are carried out by experienced veterinarians by working silently and swiftly to\nreduce stress for the seals (refinement). During sampling animals are retained by trained staff and\ncooled with seawater poured over their backs to prevent overheating (refinement).\nSealcentre Pieterburen and Sea Life Blankenberge operate under Dutch and Belgian government\nauthorization for harbour seal admission and rehabilitation, without the need for invasive sampling\npermits (as rectal swabs are seen as non-invasive), in compliance with EU directive 2010/63/EU.\nWill you process personal data?

Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? All data will be archived on the K drive local server of our research group. Once published, R scripts and bio-informatics pipelines will be deposited on GitHub, sequencing data will be submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and other data (POP concentrations, metadata) will be available online on data repositories such as Mendeley Data.
