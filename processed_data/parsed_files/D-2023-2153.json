The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \ncoordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Silvia Monteagudo - 0000-0002-3849-6270  \nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles not applicable\nProject number 1 & title 3M220685 – Uncovering regulators of H3K79 methylation in cartilage to identify targets for osteoarthritis  \ntherapy\nFunder(s) GrantID 2FWO G059223N\nAffiliation(s) KU Leuven - ROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\nPlease provide a short project description Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common chronic joint disease, is characterized by progressive damage to the  \narticular cartilage, remodelling of the joint-associated bone, and inflammation. Current OA treatments are \nlimited to pain relief, physiotherapy, or joint replacement surgery in severe cases, yet drugs that stop the \ndisease progression are lacking. DOT1L is an enzyme that chemically modifies an amino-acid (Lysine at \nposition 79) in the Histone-3 protein (H3K79) by adding a methyl group. We identified DOT1L as key \nprotector of cartilage health and reported that DOT1L activity, indicated by the levels of H3K79 \nmethylation (H3K79me), is reduced in OA compared to non-OA cartilage. Thus, maintaining H3K79me \nseems to be critical to preserve joint health and prevent the development or progression of OA. Here, we \naim to uncover regulators of H3K79me using a dual strategy. First, we will identify which histone \ndemethylase enzymes are responsible for the removal of methyl groups of H3K79 using a combination of \nin vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo techniques. Second, we will use a discovery approach based on a large-scale \nsiRNA screening in a human articular chondrocyte cell line. We will investigate the therapeutic impact of \ntargeting regulators identified using both approaches for OA in chondrocytes and explants from OA-\npatients and in well-established OA mouse models. This project could therefore identify new targets for \ntherapy of a disease with an enormous medical need.\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number. This question is optional.

The following documentation will be provided: (1) a table of content (excel file and csv) with all project- related experiments including experiment number, date of implementation and name of the researcher who stored the experiment, (2) a brief description of the goal of the experiment and related work package (word and txt file), (3) a detailed protocol or link to an existing standard protocol (SOP) which will enable other researcher to repeat the experiment, (4) all data or link to another file with the (raw) data, (5) in case of animal work: a list of the used animals with details such as age, sex, housing and link with LAIS system information, (5) samples that are generated during the experiments and will be stored and listed in a csv file, (6) if appropriate, illustrations of the data with legends and statistical analysis. In case that documentation is written or available in notebooks or stored on other files a link will be provided. (7) Read-me text files providing information about definitions used in the dataset files. With the help of these documentations every authorized researcher will be able (1) to look up all the information of the performed experiments and (2) to repeat the experiment in exactly the same way. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E.

How will these costs be covered?Current pricing for the KU Leuven Shared Network Drive is € 503,66 / TB / year. Datasets for this project are considered to require less than 50 GB. The costs both in short and long-term are covered by the project. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☒ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Current pricing for the KU Leuven Shared Network Drive is € 503,66 / TB / year. Datasets for this project are considered to require less than 50 GB. The costs both in short and long-term are covered by the project and the lab’s historical financial resources. Upon publication the datasets will be included in the KU Leuven Research Data Repository (RDR). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 106. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY.
