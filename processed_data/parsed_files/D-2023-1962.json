West Nile virus (WNV) and\nUsutu virus (USUV), two emerging arboviruses in Europe, are mainly transmitted by mosquitoes of the Culex genus. Culex pipiens, the\nnorthern house mosquito, is the most prevalent mosquito across the European continent and is regarded as the most important vector for\nWNV and USUV. Little is known about the microbiome (bacteriome and virome) of Culex mosquitoes and even less is known about how\nthis microbiome influences the ability of these mosquitoes to transmit arboviruses to vertebrates. This PhD project will characterize the\nCulex mosquito microbiome using field-collected mosquitoes from different regions worldwide. Secondly, in vivo infection experiments will\nbe performed to assess associations between the mosquito microbiome and vector competence. We will attempt to confirm such\nassociations by recolonizing axenic mosquitoes with a selection of relevant microbes and evaluate the vector competence of the\nrecolonized mosquitoes.\nLast modified: \n19-01-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
