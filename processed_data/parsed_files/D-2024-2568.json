Notably, this ability is affected in individuals with\nneurological conditions such as autism. Previous work suggests that action understanding relies on a network of brain areas consistently reported to be\nactive when observing actions. In humans, this action-observation network spans large portions of cortex, including the parietal, frontal and temporal\nlobes. What are the neuronal processes that support action understanding? A dominant hypothesis proposes that we understand actions by mapping the\nvisual representation of the observed action onto our motor representation of the same action. Studies in humans using non-invasive methods such as\nfunctional neuroimaging have mapped the nodes implicated in the action-observation network. However, these methods are limited in the information\nthey can provide. Hence the underlying neural mechanisms and temporal dynamics for action perception still need to be determined. I will conduct\nintracranial recordings in the human brain to investigate the processing steps involved in action perception at an unprecedented level of spatial and\ntemporal accuracy. In addition, I will study the temporal dynamics of functional connectivity across cortical areas. Importantly, I will compare the\nneural mechanisms supporting action execution vs. observation to identify the common substrate that encodes abstract representations of actions.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n12-01-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes There are enough resources at the university (>>TB) How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Data will be stored on the university's secure services, to which only authorized people have access. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? If additional storage is needed, I will purchase it using my bench fee. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). institutional policies...). All data will be preserved on the university servers. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Data will be preserved on the university servers. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Our lab has held ample storage space (>>TB) at university servers for over a decade. The data size is relatively small compared to severs capacity, implying a low cost, which the lab can easily assume. 5. Data sharing and reuse 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. data type which data will be made available. Yes, in an Open Access repository Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) Yes by either using repositories or by request. Created using DMPonline.be.

When will the data be made available? After publication Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. Licenses will allow reusing data for research purposes. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. section. Yes Not yet available. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Since the size of the data is reasonably manageable, it can be easily shared with minor costs that can be assumed by the lab. 6. Responsibilities 6.
