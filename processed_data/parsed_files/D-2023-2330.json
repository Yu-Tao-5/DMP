For each dataset or data type (observational, experimental etc.), provide a short name & \ndescription (sufficient for yourself to know what data it is about), indicate whether the data are newly \ngenerated/collected or reused, digital or physical, also indicate the type of the data (the kind of content), its \ntechnical format (file extension), and an estimate of the upper limit of the volume of the data.\nThe project comprises 4 work packages (WP1). WP1 is about profiling of the CRBD mouse model, establishing \nbreeding pairs and experimental designs, acquisition of techniques and methods by dedicated PhD students. WP1 \nwill consist of fully detailed assessment of various areas and dimensions of mouse behavior, using a battery of tests, \nimaging of brain connectivity, and histological analysis of white matter. The lab has extensive experience with \nbehavioral, imaging, and histological profiling of mouse models. We will collaborate with other labs for some of this \nwork and involve master’s degree students.  WP2 assesses the effects of pharmacological stimulation on CRBD \nsymptoms. The same methodology will be used as in WP1. WP3 is about optimization of transcranial electrical \nstimulation in collaboration with Mc Laughlin et al. Mouse stimulation parameters will be further optimized. WP4 \nassesses the effects of transcranial electrical stimulation on CRBD symptoms. Same methodology as WP1.\nDatase\nt \nname / \nIDDescriptionNew or \nreuseDigital or \nPhysical dataData TypeFile formatData \nvolumePhysica\nl \nvolume\n  Indicate\n:\nN(ew \ndata) or Indicate:  \nD(igital) or \nP(hysical)Indicate:\nAudiovisua Indicate\n: \nE(xistin\ng \ndata) \nNl\nImages\nSound\nNumerical \nTextual\nModel\nSOftware\nOther \n(specify)<1GB\n<100GB\n<1TB\n<5TB\n>5TB\nNA\n Behavior dataNDN,T.docx, .xlsx,<1GBProject \nfolder \non \nNetwork \nstorage \n(L drive) \nat LBP\n Microscopy \ndataNDITIFF, JPG, PNG<100GBProject \nfolder \non \nNetwork \nstorage \n(L drive) \nat LBP\n Analysis \nscripts, \nstatistical \nanalysisNDSO.m(at), .py(w), .r, .dl\nl<10GBProject \nfolder \non \nNetwork \nstorage \n(L drive) \nat LBP\n Processed \ndataNDI, N, T.xlsx, .txt,.mat,<100GBProject \nfolder \non L-\ndrive\n Presentations\n, Protocols, \nreportsNDT.ppt, .docx, .pdf<100GBProject \nfolder \non \nNetwork \nstorage \n(L drive) \nat LBP\n Microscopy \ndataNDITIFF, JPG, PNG<100GBProject \nfolder \non L-\ndrive\n        \n \n \n \n \n \nIf you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, \nHandle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type:\nNot applicable.\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or \nanimals, dual use)?
