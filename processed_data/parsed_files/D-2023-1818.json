The FWO expects a completed\nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the \nresearch co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element\nin the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and \nthe final DMP may use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP , a standardized glossary of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 1\n1.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Name : Malek Ben Khalifa & ORCID :0000-0001-6944-5663\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Name : Jérôme Loreau & ORCID : 0000-0002-6142-1509\nRole : project supervisor  \nProject number1 & title Project number : 12E6623N \nTitle : Ro-vibrational quenching of molecules of astrophysical, atmospheric and planetary interest.\nFunder(s) GrantID2FWO\nAffiliation(s) ☐ KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel \n☐ Other:\nProvide ROR3 identifier when possible:  \nPlease provide a short project description For astronomers to understand their observations, chemists must answer a fundamental question: What is\nthe excitation and (de)-excitation scheme of the molecule in interstellar regions? Is it excited via collisions\nwith molecules, or with photons?\nIn this project, we study the collisional processes that take place in astronomical environments, in fact,\nthe inelastic collisions between molecules play an important role in the populating of the rovibrational \nquantum levels which are observed. In fact, the probability for a molecule to transit from one state to \nanother via molecular collisions at a given temperature is related to the collisional rates. The range of \nphysical conditions reigning in astrophysics requires the knowledge of collisional rates between 5 and a few\nthousand Kelvin, which is the objective of our project.\n1“Project number” refers to the institutional project number .

How will these costs be covered?The storage and back up costs 240 euros/year and these costs will be covered by me (FWO bench fee) 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).The data that will be retained after the end of my project are quantum chemistry data (electronic energies for various molecules of interest in the project), as well as ro-vibrational rate coefficients of CO2, NH3 and CH4 by collision with He and/or H2 molecule. These data will always be available online for use by the astrophysical community in several database such as Basecol, Lamda and EMAA. These databases are devoted to collisional ro-vibrational excitation of molecules by colliders such as atoms, ions, molecules or electrons. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?all data (potential energy surfaces and cross sections) will be kept in an archive space at the VSC. Ro-vibrational rate coefficients will be made online in Lamda, Basecol and EMAA websites. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9 What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?On the Lamda, Basecol and EMAA websites, data preservation is free. I will also save the data in cloud, for a costof 240 euros/year. These costs will be covered by me for 3 years at least. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE ’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE , CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS . FOR MORE INFORMATION : HTTPS ://WIKI.SURFNET .NL/DISPLAY /STANDARDS /INFO-EU- REPO/#INFOEUREPO -ACCESSRIGHTS ☐ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☐ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: Codes developed during this project will be reused by me as well as by our group at KU Leuven for the study of the more detected molecules after the project. Ro-vibrational rate coefficients will be made available online for the scientific community interested by these results. Cross sections will be kept in our archive and shared upon request. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.N.A Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11 Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.all data (potential energy surfaces and cross sections) will be kept in an archive space at the VSC, Ro-vibrational rate coefficients will be available online in Lamda, Basecol and EMAA websites. When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS ’.The data will be available to the community once the results based on these data are published in scientific journals, or upon request for collaborators. The final data i.e ro-vibrational rates, will be always available online. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS . IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED , THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED . DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER : E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS .” 8 I will not provide licenses, once our results are published in peer-reviewed international journals. They will be in open access for the scientific community, Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes ☐ No If yes: 8Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12 What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? No additional resources are needed. 7.
