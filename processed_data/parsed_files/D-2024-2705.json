Despite an increasing diversification of gender roles, however, there is currently no\ntheoretical model that can accurately explain how the personal content people assign to gender\nidentities interacts with norms associated with them. Moreover, although “the other” is at the heart\nof social psychology, currently no theory can accurately predict when and how audiences influence\nsocial identity-related behaviors.\nThe current project aims to fill this gap by proposing and testing a theoretical model. Using\nmasculinity as a case, it investigates both the performance (‘playing a role’) and performativity (the\nway gender is continually made or remade; Judith Butler) of gender. It uses experimental methods to\nsystematically examine the relationship between gender identity content, audiences (in terms of\nidentities and norms), and gender-related behaviors/attitudes across three domains associated with\nmasculinity: risk-taking and aggression, emotionality, and prejudice and intergroup hostility.\nUnderstanding social identity-audience dynamics is not only important for gender psychology, but is\ncrucial for understanding social identities, from political to ethnic, and their impacts on various\nsocietal outcomes, also especially in the social media age.\nLast modified: \n24-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

The data-set is not public, no DOI, URL, or handle available.\nData collected and provided by Dr Islam Borinca (now: University of Groningen) at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, prior to\n2021 (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-020-01210-5). The data-set is not public, no DOI, URL, or handle available.\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals,\ndual use)? Describe these issues in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when\nappropriate.\nYes, human subject data\nFor dataset WP3, S4, 1a, ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the University of Oklahoma on\npaper under the name \"Reactions to Activities VI (Audience Variables)\" and from the University of Geneva. In the context of this\nstudy, the social and societal ethical commission of KU Leuven (SMEC) will be asked for permission of re-analysis, and these re-\nanalyses will be within the scope of the original ethics clearances at the Universities of Oklahoma and Geneva, respectively.\nAll other data-sets concern data generated by experiments on humans, for this personal data (described below) as well as\ninformed consent will be required. Additionally, for some studies, moderate levels of deception will be required. We will update the\nDMP with the references for future data-sets once obtained. All new collections will be cleared by the KU Leuven ethics\ncommittee (SMEC). Additionally, any data collection at other universities in- and outside of Belgium will also be cleared by\nrelevant local ethics committees.\nWill you process personal data? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use in the comment section.\nPlease refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate.\nYes\nWe will update the DMP with the references for the other data once obtained.\nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used:\nIn all empirical studies: ordinary and special category personal data, such as\nethnicity/nationality, information about education and training, socio-demographic status,\nage, sexual orientation, gender identity, and email addresses (for sending results/invitations to follow-up study/lottery of coupons,\nwill be kept separately from survey responses and experimental data).\nIn studies that require participant payment through KU Leuven: name, home address,\nand bank account (will be kept separately from survey responses and experimental data).\nDoes your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial\nexploitation, …)?

If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they\nrelate and what restrictions are in place.\nNo\nThere are currently no such agreements in place. For all empirical datasets, students (thesis students/research interns/job\nstudents) will sign a confidentiality agreement to not distribute this information, to delete this data once they stop working on the\ndata, and to treat this information with respect and in a confidential way.\nAre there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data\nyou (re)use? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and which restrictions will be\nasserted.\nNo\n2. Documentation and Metadata\nClearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data\nunderstandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and\ntypes required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information\nis recorded).\nFor each dataset generated by the PhD candidate, a data sheet will be made, according to the data management protocol of the\nresearch unit of CSCP of the faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences (KU Leuven), which deals with (1) the essential\nproject information and (2) the study content information. In (1) the project title will be added, as well as the main contributors, the\nstart and end date of the project, the funding for the project, the start and end date of the data collection, the reference to the\napproval of the ethical commission and the location of all the information about the project that is stored on personal computers.\nIn (2) the aims and research questions are discussed, as well as the design, the final sample and sampling procedure, the data\ncollection equipment, the software used for data collection and data analyses (including SPSS syntax and R\ncode files), the materials that are used, variable-level information (label, question text, codes, frequencies), a summary of the\nanalyses and results, references to publications or other official output, and certain problems during data collection or analyses or\nif certain participants were removed and why.\nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate\nper dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or\ndata type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nDescriptive metadata will be created as part of the documentation on study content information, see answer above. In addition,\nthe SPSS datafiles automatically capture various metadata: e.g., creator of data, date that the data was created, data size,\nlocation, language, descriptive variable and value labels, missing values and measurement levels.\n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nDuring the process of conducting the study, the PhD student will store all the data on\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 24 April 2024\n5 of 8\nBitlocker encrypted computers on OneDrive operated by KU Leuven. Email addresses and\npersonal data needed for paying participants will be kept separately from survey responses and experimental data and will only be\naccessible by the PhD student and main supervisor. Only the PhD student, main supervisor, and possibly students working on the\nproject will have access to the raw data. For all empirical datasets, students (thesis students/research interns/job students) will\nsign a confidentiality agreement to not distribute this information, to delete this data once they stop working on the data, and to\ntreat this information with respect and in a confidential way. If necessary, the co-supervisor will be provided access to generated\ndata. In this case, a data-sharing agreement will be implemented with the co-supervisor and her host-institution. Data will always\nbe transferred in an encrypted fashion or within the KU Leuven OneDrive system. \nAfter a study is completed, the PhD student will also upload the data (except the personally identifying data) to a shared network\ndrive of the research unit CSCP at the faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences (KU Leuven). The PhD student will\nfollow the data management protocol of this research unit. For each of the five studies a folder will be created with the same\nsubfolders: (1) a read-me file; (2) a data sheet; (3) the conceptualization of the study: literature review, meetings, preparatory\nstudies; (4) the organization of the study: ethical approval, participant recruitment; (5) the material of the study: e.g. used\nquestionnaire, interview, scales, including a subfolder with the development of the material (different steps, feedback, pilot study,\n...); (6) the data and analysis of the study: raw data (see below), anonymized data, data cleaning (with amongst others the syntax\nand cleaned dataset) and the results; (7) output: manuscripts, presentations.\nFor studies potentially executed external to KU Leuven, data might if necessary also be stored locally at equally or more stringent\nlevels of security with eventual transfer back to KU Leuven. The DMP will be updated to clarify if this is the case.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nFor all studies: All data is stored on OneDrive operated by KU Leuven, and after a study is\ncompleted also on a shared network drive of the research unit CSCP at the faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences\n(except the personally identifying data). \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nFor all datasets containing personal data (e.g., gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation etc.), data will be stored on Bitlocker\nencrypted computers on OneDrive operated by KU Leuven. When a study has been completed, the PhD student will also upload\nall the data (expect the personally identifying data) to a network drive of the research unit CSCP at the faculty of Psychology and\nEducational Sciences. The data can also be made available to students for certain purposes, such as a student job, a bachelor's\nthesis or master's thesis. In this case, students (thesis students/research interns/job students) will sign a confidentiality agreement\nto not distribute this information, to delete this data once they stop working on the data, and to treat this information with respect\nand in a confidential way. If necessary, the co-supervisor will be provided access to generated data. In this case, a data-sharing\nagreement will be implemented with the co-supervisor and her host-institution. Data will always be transferred in an encrypted\nfashion or within the KU Leuven OneDrive system. \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nKU Leuven provides all academic staff and students with KU Leuven OneDrive services.\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are\napplicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g.\nlegal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

In (1) the project title will be added, as well as the main contributors, the start and end date of the project, the funding for the project, the start and end date of the data collection, the reference to the approval of the ethical commission and the location of all the information about the project that is stored on personal computers. In (2) the aims and research questions are discussed, as well as the design, the final sample and sampling procedure, the data collection equipment, the software used for data collection and data analyses (including SPSS syntax and R code files), the materials that are used, variable-level information (label, question text, codes, frequencies), a summary of the analyses and results, references to publications or other official output, and certain problems during data collection or analyses or if certain participants were removed and why. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. No Descriptive metadata will be created as part of the documentation on study content information, see answer above. In addition, the SPSS datafiles automatically capture various metadata: e.g., creator of data, date that the data was created, data size, location, language, descriptive variable and value labels, missing values and measurement levels. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? During the process of conducting the study, the PhD student will store all the data on Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 24 April 2024 5 of 8 Bitlocker encrypted computers on OneDrive operated by KU Leuven. Email addresses and personal data needed for paying participants will be kept separately from survey responses and experimental data and will only be accessible by the PhD student and main supervisor. Only the PhD student, main supervisor, and possibly students working on the project will have access to the raw data. For all empirical datasets, students (thesis students/research interns/job students) will sign a confidentiality agreement to not distribute this information, to delete this data once they stop working on the data, and to treat this information with respect and in a confidential way. If necessary, the co-supervisor will be provided access to generated data. In this case, a data-sharing agreement will be implemented with the co-supervisor and her host-institution. Data will always be transferred in an encrypted fashion or within the KU Leuven OneDrive system. After a study is completed, the PhD student will also upload the data (except the personally identifying data) to a shared network drive of the research unit CSCP at the faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences (KU Leuven). The PhD student will follow the data management protocol of this research unit. For each of the five studies a folder will be created with the same subfolders: (1) a read-me file; (2) a data sheet; (3) the conceptualization of the study: literature review, meetings, preparatory studies; (4) the organization of the study: ethical approval, participant recruitment; (5) the material of the study: e.g. used questionnaire, interview, scales, including a subfolder with the development of the material (different steps, feedback, pilot study, ...); (6) the data and analysis of the study: raw data (see below), anonymized data, data cleaning (with amongst others the syntax and cleaned dataset) and the results; (7) output: manuscripts, presentations. For studies potentially executed external to KU Leuven, data might if necessary also be stored locally at equally or more stringent levels of security with eventual transfer back to KU Leuven. The DMP will be updated to clarify if this is the case. How will the data be backed up? For all studies: All data is stored on OneDrive operated by KU Leuven, and after a study is completed also on a shared network drive of the research unit CSCP at the faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences (except the personally identifying data). Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? For all datasets containing personal data (e.g., gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation etc.), data will be stored on Bitlocker encrypted computers on OneDrive operated by KU Leuven. When a study has been completed, the PhD student will also upload all the data (expect the personally identifying data) to a network drive of the research unit CSCP at the faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences. The data can also be made available to students for certain purposes, such as a student job, a bachelor's thesis or master's thesis. In this case, students (thesis students/research interns/job students) will sign a confidentiality agreement to not distribute this information, to delete this data once they stop working on the data, and to treat this information with respect and in a confidential way. If necessary, the co-supervisor will be provided access to generated data. In this case, a data-sharing agreement will be implemented with the co-supervisor and her host-institution. Data will always be transferred in an encrypted fashion or within the KU Leuven OneDrive system. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? KU Leuven provides all academic staff and students with KU Leuven OneDrive services. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 24 April 2024 6 of 8 All data will be retained at least for the expected 5 years period after the end of the project, except the personal information needed for payment/sending results/sending invitations for follow-up studies/coupon lottery, which will be deleted after they are used for their intended purpose. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? The data will be stored on the university's central servers (i.e., the J-drive of the Center for Social and Cultural Psychology (Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, KU Leuven), with automatic back-up procedures) for at least 10 years, in accordance with KU Leuven RDM policy. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? N/A 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in an Open Access repository All newly generated data-sets will be made available upon publication or at the end of the project on KU Leuven's open-access repository RDR. This concerns meta-data (automatically standardized) and cleaned data-sets. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. N/A Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes, Privacy aspects Yes, Ethical aspects For all newly generated data-sets, personal information needed for payment/sending results/sending invitations for follow-up studies/coupon lottery will be deleted after they are used for their intended purpose and will not be uploaded to the KU Leuven RDR. Where necessary, other identifying information will be not be uploaded either. If so, the DMP will be updated to reflect this. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. For all data-sets: KU Leuven RDR. For data collected outside KU Leuven, perhaps other databases will be necessary. If so, the DMP will be updated to reflect this, and data-sets will be linked via unique identifiers. When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results or at the end of the project. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 24 April 2024 7 of 8 Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. Yes What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? N/A 6. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project?
