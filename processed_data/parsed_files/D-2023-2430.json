The messages in the experiment focus on their success, the positive outcomes of obtaining a higher education degree, and having a growth mindset. Condition 2 (i.e., non-first-generation student condition) uses the same video clips as condition 1. However, the messages focus on the successes, positive outcomes of obtaining a higher education degree, and having a growth mindset as a non-first- generation student. Condition 3 (i.e., control condition) uses the same scenes as the previous conditions. No references will be made to career- related topics or the people being students.

Condition 2 (i.e., the non-first- generation student condition) shows the same videos as the first-generation student condition. The videos will be edited so they portray a day in a life of a non- first-generation student. Condition 3 (i.e., control condition) will use the same videos as the previous conditions.
