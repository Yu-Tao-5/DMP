Experimental data: After each experiment, the test data will be saved as a set of .txt and .xls files generated automatically during the test. Together with that, a short report will be provided in word and pdf versions with the specific test setup parameters, etc. The drawi ngs in .dwg format will depict the structural elements tested. Data aggregation and analysis of test data can be done in Excel. Photos of experiments will be stored in .jpeg and .heif/hevc format s. 2. Simulations: The FE simulation files will be stored as .cae and .jnl files, which can be opened in a text editor to see the commands used, or opened in Abaqus with the models appropriately numbered and classified. An Excel file will be created describing the parameters of each generated model. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COUL D ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: Word and Excel files will be used providing guidance to simplify the search. 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? All the data will be mirrored to KU Leuven OneDrive for Business (personal storage with max. capacity 2 TB) on a daily basis (continuous synchronization). The data from local computers will also be mirrored to One Drive on a daily basis. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10 How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS , STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON -DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH .7 REFER TO INSTITUTION -SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE . Experimental and simulation data will be saved on KU Leuven servers . Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: 2 TB are provided, and extra space can be provided upon request If no, please specify : How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 7 Data can be accessed using a secure password and a K U Leuven authenticator. External members can only be granted personalized access. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The costs for data storage and backup are covered by the allocated project budget. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). All data will be retained for a period of 10 years according to the KU Leuve n RDM policy Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? The data will be stored on so -called ‘Archive Storage’ of KU Leuven ICTS. The mirrored hard drive will also be stored during this period of 10 years. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these co sts be covered? The cost for ‘Archive Storage’ of KU Leuven ICTS is € 104.42 EUR/year, corresponding to an expected total cost of 1 044.2 EUR. The cost for data preservation is covered by the allocated project budget and will be paid upfront. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE ’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE , CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY . AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS . FOR MORE INFORMATION : HTTPS ://WIKI.SURFNET .NL/DISPLAY /STANDARDS /INFO-EU- REPO /#INFOEUREPO -ACCESS RIGHTS ☐ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☒ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: The data collected through this project will make a valuable contribution and can be shared afterwards upon request after approval and in agreement with the research institution. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please expl ain per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify : Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13 When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS ’. The data will be made available as soon as the main findings of the project have been published. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN B E REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS . IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED , THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED . DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT . EXAMPLE ANSWER : E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS .” 8 https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr/licenses Attribution- NonCommercial- ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY -NC-SA 4.0) Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here . INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes: What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Publications of research findings are expected to be free of charge. 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14 7.
