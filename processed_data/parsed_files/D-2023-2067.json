Each file or folder is labelled with the corresponding measurement date. A ReadMe file that describes the organization and content of the MATLAB scripts is included. In addition, each file contains clear in-line comments that provide documentation for the code. The data acquisition parameters, processing steps, and script structures are currently described in OneNote. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.

STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ No If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: This PhD-project is being conducted within the Living lab Raversijde , in this Living lab multiple projects of different universities and companies are carried out. Data will be stored conform the standard determined by Living lab. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 104.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? -Local desktop file storage on the researcher’s personal KU Leuven network drive. -Local desktop file storage on the shared KU Leuven network drive. -Cloud-based storage on KU Leuven OneDrive for Business. -External hard drives. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.Local desktop file storage, with automated backups on the researcher’s personal KU Leuven network drive and regular backups on the shared network drive and the external hard drives. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes -Local desktop file storage on the researcher’s personal KU Leuven network drive. -Local desktop file storage on the shared KU Leuven network drive. -Cloud-based storage on KU Leuven OneDrive for Business. -External hard drives. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7This project does not involve the use of sensitive personal data. However, access to both cloud and ICTS based storage solutions is restricted to authorized personnel with proper credentials that are centrally managed. This ensures that unauthorized access through legal means is not possible. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?If expenses arise, a portion of the allocated FWO project budget may be utilized. Nevertheless, there is currently no anticipation of such expenses. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 115. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All data will be retained for at least five years. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?Data will be archived on the local desktop file storage on the shared KU Leuven network drive and within Living lab Raversijde. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?If expenses arise, a portion of the allocated FWO project budget may be utilized. Nevertheless, there is currently no anticipation of such expenses. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 126. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) The metadata will be publicly accessible. The real data will be available, but only upon request through the supervisor or Living lab Raversijde . If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.The metadata will be publicly accessible. The real data will be available, but only upon request and approval by the supervisor or Living lab Raversijde . Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☒ No Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.Data will be made available through Living lab Raversijde . When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.Once the main results of the project are published, the information will become accessible. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 In order to ensure proper attribution and credit to the original creators of the data, it is important to include a citation to the previously published paper when reusing the data. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☒ Yes If yes: DOI What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Although it is anticipated that data publication will not incur any costs, if necessary, a portion of the allocated FWO project budget may be used to cover any expenses that arise. 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 147.
