The database is not open access, but is found in our shared J drive (J:\\GBW-0352_Neuropathology\\NeuroPatho\\BIOBANK\\Database) Protocols were also developed in our research group, and are not open access but are located on out shared server found here: J:\\GBW-0352_Neuropathology\\NeuroPatho\\Protocols FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 7Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number.☒ Yes, human subject data; provide SMEC or EC approval number: S-59292, S-52791 ☐ Yes, animal data; provide ECD reference number: ☐ Yes, dual use; provide approval number: ☐ No Additional information: Will you process personal data4? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number).☐ Yes (provide PRET G-number or EC S-number below) ☒ No Additional information: Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin- offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please comment: The mass spectrometry files could yield potential disease related biomarkers to be used in the clinical setting. 4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 8Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please explain: -One mass spectrometry dataset will be generated in collaboration with Prof. Judith Steen at Harvard Medical School, and both parties will share the data equally and all publications results from these data will be with co-authorship -Part of the project will be conducted with my promoter Prof. Patrik Verstreken, at CBD-VIB, and data generated will also be equally shared and any resulting publications using these data will have co- authorship between the contributing parties. -MTAs will be established for these collaborations to share results, materials, methodologies and co- authorship. Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3.Documentation and Metadata FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .Our approach complies with FAIR: F indable: Data files will be labelled with the date and name of experiment which serve as keywords to find the proper files. Files related to each project work package/experiment, will be organized in folders. Additionally, README.txt files will be created for every experiment type, including explanation of how the data was generated and/or quantified. A ccessible: Published data will provide a database in the supplementary material. All abbreviations are defined. Mass spectrometry data are uploaded to ProteomeXchange. I nteroperable: Standard and vocabolatories are provided in the related publications. Database upload follows standardized roads. R eusable: With the measures explained above other researcher will be able to reuse our data properly. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: Mass spectrometry raw data will be uploaded for public access at Proteome Xchange. If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: Neuropathological datasets are excel sheets with clearly identified variables. To our knowledge there are no neuropathology metadata standards for neurodegenerative diseases. 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data.☒ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☐ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☒ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☒ Other: Institutional Microsoft teams How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? ☒ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back-ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes – 4.28 PB available on Large Volume Storage drive ☐ No If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data Data will be exclusively processed using KU Leuven computers and will not be at any moment transferred to personal devices. All data is user-protected. For reused data, there is an agreement in which each user makes a copy of the original file and makes the changes on that new file, preserving all unmodified versions in a separate folder. For transferring data between KU Leuven users, Belnet or UZ liquid files will be used. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Covered by the research budget of Prof. Dietmar Thal. The cost of the J drive is <100EUR per year, and the L(large volume storage) drive is 10Tb, and the cost is 950EUR per year. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period?
