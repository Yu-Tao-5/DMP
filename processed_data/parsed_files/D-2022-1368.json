Explore in vitro the\nimmunomodulatory and immunogenic responses of these nKSPCs; \n2. Analyse in vitro the\nregenerative effects of nKSPCs in direct and indirect contact with human kidney tissue and\nunravel the involved mechanisms; 3. Investigate the immunomodulatory and regenerative effects\nof nKSPCs therapy leading to improved kidney function in an ex-vivo translational model; 4.\nGenerate and validate clinical grade nKSPCs for clinical application as tool for human kidney-\ntargeted cell therapy.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
