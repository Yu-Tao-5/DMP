While current data point to amyloid-\nβ\n (A\nβ\n) as the pathogenic trigger, it is still not known how A\nβ\ndrives pathogenic cascades that ultimately lead to neurodegeneration. We believe that studying amyloid-positive, cognitively unimpaired\n(AP-CU) cases is instrumental to decipher AD-linked pathogenic and resilience mechanisms. Here, we propose a novel hypothesis where\nA\nβ\n is essential but disease only results from the complex interplay between A\nβ\n, other protein stressors, lipid metabolism and\ninflammation. Our research aims at unraveling the bases of neuron vulnerability and resilience by applying an interdisciplinary approach\nand cutting-edge approaches. The gained insights may guide novel strategies to fight AD.\nID: \nID: \n213706\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-10-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n30-09-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n27-03-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Project Administrator: Project Administrator: Patrick Vandormael Affiliation: Affiliation: KU Leuven (KUL) Template: Template: KU Leuven BOF-IOF Principal Investigator: Principal Investigator: n.n. n.n. Project abstract: Project abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a highly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that, in absence of effective therapies, is expected to affect ~139 million people worldwide by 2050. While current data point to amyloid- β (A β ) as the pathogenic trigger, it is still not known how A β drives pathogenic cascades that ultimately lead to neurodegeneration. We believe that studying amyloid-positive, cognitively unimpaired (AP-CU) cases is instrumental to decipher AD-linked pathogenic and resilience mechanisms. Here, we propose a novel hypothesis where A β is essential but disease only results from the complex interplay between A β , other protein stressors, lipid metabolism and inflammation. Our research aims at unraveling the bases of neuron vulnerability and resilience by applying an interdisciplinary approach and cutting-edge approaches. The gained insights may guide novel strategies to fight AD.

The organisation of research data follows a hierarchical folder structure folder structure based on model organism (eg. iPSCs, human biopsies, PBMCs). At the second level, these folders contain subfolders per experiment type (eg. western blotting, immunofluorescence, spatial transcriptomics,...). At the third level, these folders contain subfolders per individual experiment (with date indication, see below). Each of these experiment folders contain subfolders for raw data, processed data, and analysed data. Digital files and folders of individual experiments will be named named following a standard naming convention. All file names in a given dataset will follow the same format: they will start with the date, followed by the project acronym, a concise descriptive name, and an optional version number. Whenever possible, names will be kept under 32 characters, containing only letters, numbers, and underscores. Dots will only be used for version control indicators (minor revisions indicated by decimal numbers, and major revisions by whole numbers): YYYYMMDD_Project_Experiment_ version.format. Similarly, folder naming for individual experiments follows the following structure: YYYYMMDD(_Project)_Experiment Data will be accompanied by documentation documentation containing all contextual and descriptive features of the research data, which allow to understand and (re)use the data. Detailed procedures of each experiment are logged in the electronic laboratory notebook ( E- E- notebook) notebook) , with reference of each experiment to the directory path of the folder containing raw and analysed data files. This also includes data collection methods, protocols, and code explanation. Documentation is stored at the study- and the data-level, providing data provenance from the original source data to specific datasets linked to publications. Data will be generated following standardized protocols protocols . Clear and detailed descriptions of these protocols will be stored in our lab protocol database and E-notebook.
