The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Pieter Vanmechelen                                              0000-0002-3733-2880\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Giovanni Samaey             Promotor                     0000-0001-8433-4523\nGeert Lombaert                Co-promotor              0000-0002-9273-3038\nProject number1 & title  3E200531      Multilevel Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian full-field data assimilation\nFunder(s) GrantID21SD1823N\nAffiliation(s) ■ KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nProvide ROR3 identifier when possible:  \nPlease provide a short project description Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are an indispensable tool in sampling probability\ndistributions for which a direct sampling is impossible. In Bayesian data assimilation, these methods\nare used to sample the posterior probability distribution for a parameter that needs to be estimated\nbased on an accept-reject procedure, given a prior distribution for the parameter and a model that\nallows computing the likelihood of the data for a given value of the parameter.\nThis project deals with the development and analysis of MCMC methods when the available data has\na full-field nature. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods face two problems when confronted with full field\ndata. First, computing the likelihood can be a very expensive  step in MCMC sampling, especially when the \ncorresponding model contains multiple time scales and  is high-dimensional. Second, the  acceptance rates of \nstandard MCMC procedures drop as the data dimensionality increases.  In this project, we will develop and analyse  \nmultilevel Markov chain Monte Carlo methods that  increase the computational efficiency of Bayesian posterior \nsampling by making use of a hierarchy of  levels at different resolution, and by explicitly exploiting spatial \ncorrelation that is present in full-field  data. While being application-independent in nature, the developed methods  \nwill be applied to problems in damage assessment in civil engineering.\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number. This question is optional since not every institution has an internal project number different from the GrantID. Applicants can \nonly provide one project number.  2 Funder(s) GrantID refers to the number of the DMP at the funder(s), here one can specify multiple GrantIDs if multiple funding sources were used.3 Research Organization Registry Community. https://ror.org/\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 32.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.Open access repositories will be created upon publication of the corresponding paper.
