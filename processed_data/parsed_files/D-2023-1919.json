The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.  \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Diego Martinez Zarazua https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9904-2272\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles\nProject number1 & title  \nFunder(s) GrantID2\nAffiliation(s) ☐   KU Leuven   \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nProvide ROR3 identifier when possible:  \n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

The claim I want to explore is whether and how this economic framing can impoverish the \nexperience of the world around us. I call this reduction of the thick meaningful presence of what is to \neconomic value “the impoverishment of the lifeworld.” Thus, this project draws on the resources of \nphenomenology and Marxist critique to 1) fully articulate the qualitative impoverishment of the lifeworld \nthat underlies the dynamics of capitalism, specifically in the spheres of things and of the social relations \nwhereby such things are exchanged as commodities, and 2) explore modes of critique and resistance \ndesigned to counter such forms of phenomenological impoverishment.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.
