In line with the  \nbroader  field  of  entrepreneurship,  it  examines  the  nature  of  opportunities,  the  characteristics  of  \nentrepreneurs, and the outcomes associated with such efforts. However, the majority of research has  \nfocused on the entrepreneur-opportunity nexus, with limited emphasis on actual environmental outcomes,  \nand a focus on intermediate proxies such as firm entry, market creation and product adoption instead.  \nMoreover, while historical patterns suggest that innovations to address an environmental issue often create  \nnew,  more  complex  problems,  environmental  entrepreneurship  is  commonly  understood  as  being  \ninherently beneficial. This dissertation relaxes this assumption and explicitly seeks to explain the dynamics of  \nunintended consequences through the lens of policy resistance, where well-intentioned interventions fail  \ndue to a mismatch between the mental models used to make decisions and complex realities in which they  \ninterfere. By analyzing the role of delayed, distant, and feedback effects, this research extends the literature  \non outcomes in environmental entrepreneurship by moving beyond intermediate proxies, like market  \ncreation and product adoption, and explains the dynamics underlying unexpected outcomes. Moreover, the  \nfocus of this dissertation on unintended consequences of well-intentioned interventions, complements the  \nexisting  discussion  of  reasons  for  limited  progress  towards  environmental  goals   in  the  corporate  \nsustainability literature, which revolve around greenwashing and corporate inaction. More broadly the  \ndissertation contributes to the discussion of how theories can become counterperformative, and positions  \npolicy resistance as a gradual and actionable approach to systems thinking.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

How will these costs be covered?The costs are covered by central KU Leuven services. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☒ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?The costs are covered by central KU Leuven services. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 116. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☐ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☒ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.All data sets containing personal data can only be made available for replication upon request. Given the personal data involved, data transfer agreement would have to be set up at this point. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☒ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify: Most of the datasets used for this project contain personal data which means that they cannot be shared or made publicly available. In addition, the DTA signed to get access to the carsharing data does not allow us to publish the datasets. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Other data repository (specify) ☐ Other (specify) When will the data be made available? ☐ Upon publication of research results ☒ Specific date (specify) : 1/11/2024 ☐ Other (specify) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT.

If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☒ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☐ No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? The costs are covered by central KU Leuven services. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 137.
