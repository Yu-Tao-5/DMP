I n spite of decades of AD research, no effective treatment  \nstrategy has been found and adequate screening and diagnostic tools are lacking due to high -\ncost, invasiveness, and non -scalability. The retina is the only part of the central nervous system \nthat is  easily accessible for high -resolution, non -invasive imaging and offers unique opportunities \nfor diagnosis and screening of neuropathies. Indeed, one of the AD hallmarks, amyloid beta (Aβ)  \ndeposition, can be detected using a novel imaging technique, namely  hyperspectral retinal \nimaging  (HSRI). Thus, in this research project , we aim to elucidat e the molecular basis and \npathological  correlates of HSRI signals in AD, in order to  use this approach as an AD biomarker. \nThis will be  achieved by studying HSRI signals in vitro  and in vivo , starting with defining the \nsignature of Aβ  conformational forms; followed by characterizing the HSRI signature in different \ncell and mouse  models of  neurodegenerative proteinopathies; and correlating these data with \nbiomolecular assays.  The information on the specificity, molecular basis and pathological \ncorrelates of HSRI in AD gained  from this project, will be critical for its rational implementatio n in \nthe clinic.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        4 \n 2.

FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 3 Please provide a short project description Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and leading cause of dementia, affecting more than 50 million people worldwide. I n spite of decades of AD research, no effective treatment strategy has been found and adequate screening and diagnostic tools are lacking due to high - cost, invasiveness, and non -scalability. The retina is the only part of the central nervous system that is easily accessible for high -resolution, non -invasive imaging and offers unique opportunities for diagnosis and screening of neuropathies. Indeed, one of the AD hallmarks, amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition, can be detected using a novel imaging technique, namely hyperspectral retinal imaging (HSRI). Thus, in this research project , we aim to elucidat e the molecular basis and pathological correlates of HSRI signals in AD, in order to use this approach as an AD biomarker. This will be achieved by studying HSRI signals in vitro and in vivo , starting with defining the signature of Aβ conformational forms; followed by characterizing the HSRI signature in different cell and mouse models of neurodegenerative proteinopathies; and correlating these data with biomolecular assays. The information on the specificity, molecular basis and pathological correlates of HSRI in AD gained from this project, will be critical for its rational implementatio n in the clinic.

It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all materials tha t need proper management because they are valuable, diffic ult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentatio n/metadata. RDM Guidance on data FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9 If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type. / Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when app ropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number . ☐ Yes, human subject data ; provide SMEC or EC a pproval number: ☒ Yes, animal data ; provide ECD reference number: ☐ Yes, dual use; provide approva l number : ☐ No Additional information : We will conduct animal experiments, more specifically on mice, in accordance with the standard laboratory safety rules. All necessary safety measures for both laboratory and animal experiments will be strictly observed . Our methods follow the guidelines and rules set by the HSE Department (Health, Safety and Environment) and the Animal Ethics Committee at KU Leuven. Ethical permission for animal work will be obtained during year 2 of the FWO project . Will you process personal data4? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number). ☐ Yes (provide PRET G -number or EC S -number below) ☒ No Additional information: . 4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10 Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer , for example spin - offs, commercial exploitation, … )? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate . ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes , please comment : The project largely contains strategic research that will generate insights that may, in the long term, be further exploited for valorisation . The project consists of two valorization track s. On the one hand, we aim to gather a solid base of evidence to support further clinical development of HSI as a diagnostic tool to assess retinal Aβ burden. On the other hand, we aim to develop tools, together with AD mouse models, that may serve as a pre clinical research platform to assess the efficacy of a therapeutic intervention. While there is full FTO, there is no opportunity to generate IP. However, valorisation opportunities will be considered, in consultation with our IP officer Julien Compagnon a t Leuven Research and Development . Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relat e and what restrictions are in place. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please explain: Material transfer agreements have been signed to obtain the transgenic mouse lines used in this project. Valorisation opportunities, in agreement with these MTAs, will be evaluated case by case in consultation with our IP officer Julien Compagnon at Leuven Research and Development . Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, p lease explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11 3. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures u sed, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata . We will keep record s for each work pa ckage for 10 years (where applicable): Digital data : - Experimental design and protocol (.docx file) - List of a bbreviations used (.docx file) - Data structure documentation (.docx file) - Data analysis steps and relevant scripts (MATLAB, Python, ImageJ and Imaris scripts) - Raw data (specific file format according to data type) - Analy zed data ( .xlsx and .prism ) - Index file/readme file (.txt file) for each work package, detailing the names, locations (folder and subfolder structure ), and descriptions of the aforementioned files. Physical data: Samples collected during experiments will be documented and preserved for the duration of the project. Depending on the sample type, they will be stored in fixatives or freezers. Immunohistologically stained slides will be stored in appropriate containers in a dry place or freezer. Due to the nature of these samples, they cannot be kept for 10 years and they will be discarded when analyses have been concluded.

In addition, data will be presented at (inter)national scientific meetings specific to the field , such as ARVO, AAIC , AD-PD meetings, etc. We intend to make data openly available via data repositories. Requests for non-deposited data will be evaluated on a case -by-case basis and may be provided upon request. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. / Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?
