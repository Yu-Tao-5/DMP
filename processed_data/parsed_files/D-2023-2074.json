The RAS isoform \nKRAS has the most prevalent mutations, which are linked to more than 85% of pancreatic cancer and a \nsignificant percentage of lung a nd colorectal cancers. Despite many efforts and large investments by \nbiotech and pharma, an adequate treatment for RAS dysfunction remains elusive.Using biochemical, \nstructural, and in -cell screening approaches, and in close collaboration with the Centre f or Drug Design \nand Discovery (CD3), I will develop a small -molecule treatment for RAS dysregulation. This strategy will be \nbased on stabilizing the association of KRAS proteins with the prenyl binding protein PDE6D. Practically, \nthe molecule will act as “m olecular glue”, which will prevent PDE6D from shuttling KRAS back towards the \nplasma membrane, interfering with its signaling activity.

DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS , STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON -DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH .7 REFER TO INSTITUTION -SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE . Backup procedures are in place in the OneDrive for Business programme . Multiple data storage methods will also ensure backup. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: 2TB storage space from OneDrive for Business is sufficient currently, but it can be increased to 5TB if motivated. Also 1TB external hard drives are available in the lab. If no, please specify : 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11 How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 7 OneDrive for Business has restricted access and the other storage methods are personal. Also no sensitive personal or patient information will be generated . To access OneDrive for Business online, KUL multifactor authentication is in place. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? OneDrive for Business is free for KUL employees , external harddrive costs (50 euro per harddrive) will be covered with the bench fee of the applicant 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). All data is digital and will be retained for at least five years . Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? Published data will be made available , other data will be archived on the KU Leuven network drive K and external harddrives will be archived in the promotors/copromotors lab. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Data archived on the KUL network drive K will be retained for an annual fee of 150 euro per TB, the promot ers budget will be used to cover these costs FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILA BLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY .

FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13 When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS ’. Upon publication of research results Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS . IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED , THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY RE USED . DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT . EXAMPLE ANSWER : E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREAT IVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS .” 8 We strongly support open access of resulting data, codes, and publications with strict adherence to FAIR - data principles after securing valuable intellectual property (IP). Early and open access to peer -reviewed publications is ensured by dissemination under the green and the gold open access model. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes: What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? All data will be published with open access , so there will be a large cost to be paid. The costs will be covered using the applicants bench fee 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14 7.
