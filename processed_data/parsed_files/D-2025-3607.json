The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal.

If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3.Documentation and Metadata 4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 8Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .For genomic sequence data (including short- and long-read DNA, RNA, and ATAC), NCBI metadata standards for data submission will be used. This includes: - Sample ID (NCBI accession and lab ID) - Sample origin - Date of sampling - Location of sampling - Tissue - Life stage - Sex - Sequence type and sequence platform Data processing pipelines stored on GitHub will be accompanied with readme.txt files. Phenotypic measurements of beetles will be stored in excel sheets including clone ID, clone origin, phenotypic value, experimenter and date of experiment. An electronic lab book in which all metadata is shared and curated to common standards will be kept through a lab group on Microsoft teams. I will also keep printed version of my protocols for the fieldwork, the molecular biology experiments and bioinformatic pipelines. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: 1.

CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data The KU Leuven VSC Tier-1 Data Storage has a strict permissions system (read/write/modify), which will be limited to the primary collectors of the data. External hardddrives will be stored safely lockers in the lab space or in the office of Steven Van Belleghem. Personal computers will be protected password protected. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Costs for data storage are included in the funded project and allow purchasing external harddrives and KU Leuven VSC Tier-1 Data Storage until the end of the project. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) All raw sequencing will be publicly stored >25 years. 1. Raw sequencing reads for: - Short-read DNA sequences (.fastQ) - Long-read DNA sequences (.fastQ) - ATAC-seq (.fastQ) - RNA-seq (.fastQ) - Hi-C (.fastQ) 2.
