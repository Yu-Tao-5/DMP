Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata . All digital data and metadata accompanying physical data will be stored on the data mana gement platform from KU Leuven ManGO. This platform allows researchers to store and manage their data via different clients such as ManGO portal, or SFTP client s. • Storage The data is stored securely in the data centers of KU Leuven. Of each file, two copies are stored: one in the datacenter in Heverlee, and one other in the datacentre of Leuven. • Metadata Data can be described in the platform by adding metadata (at the file or folder level) to provide context to the data and make the data fin dable via the search interface. Each dataset will include a metadata file which will contain: o Title and description of the dataset o Names and contact information of the data creators o Date of data collection o Anonymized identifiers of pa tients from which samples were derived o File formats and structure o Instructions for accessing and using the data and relationship between different data elements The structure of the ManGO platform ensures data adheres to the FAIR data principles. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : The ManGO platform allows users to design metadata schemas. Using these schemas, users of the ManGO portal have to fill in specific information accompanying their data -uplo ad. Specific schemes will be designed for each datatype. Single -cell RNA seq data o Dataset title o Dataset description o File format ▪ Raw data: FASTQ ▪ Processed data: BAM/SAM, HDF5, CSV ▪ Metadata: CSV, JSON o Sample ID o Donor ID o Sample collection data o Sequencing platform o Read length o Sequencing depth o Library preparation protocol o Raw data processing software o Alignment reference genome Multiplex immunofluorescence data o Dataset title o Dataset description o File format ▪ Raw images: TIFF ▪ Processed images: OME -TIFF ▪ Metadata: JSON, CSV o Sample ID FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10 o Donor ID o Sample collection date o Fixation method o Section thickness o Microscope model ▪ Objective ▪ Resolution For all physical datasets (e.g. FFPE and frozen tumor material) containers will be labelled with: o Project ID o Sample ID o Donor ID o Date of collection o Material type o Sample processing method • Fixation • Freezing o These physical samples will be accompanied by a metadata file in ManGO detailing the same information as the label on the physical container , with the addition of location where container is stored • Liquid nitrogen tank ID (flash frozen/viable frozen tissue ) ▪ Rack number ▪ Box number ▪ Box position • Storage container ID (FFPE material) If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11 3.

WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? ☒ Standard back -up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back -ups I make (specify) ☒ Other (specify) The data are stored securely in the data centers of KU Leuven. Of each file, two copies are stored: one in the datacenter in Heverlee, and one other in the datacentre of Leuven. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity du ring the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No See above If no, please specify : FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12 How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . Guidance on security for research data ManGo can only be accessed via KU Leuven accounts (after being granted permission) via the ManGO portal or through SFTP clients. The KU Leuven RDM -ICTS support team manag es access and permission to the ManGO platform . What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The expected costs for data storage are EUR 330.00/year. Thes e costs have been accounted for in our application for this project at FWO. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, insti tutional policies.. .). Guidance on data preservation ☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be ke pt for 10 years (explain) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13 Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data .
