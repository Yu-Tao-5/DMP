If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. datasets or data types when appropriate. No In this project we will not collect data. The challenges in this project are motivated by real-world, industrial cases in other projects. Although we do not foresee this, if a real-world use case would be deemed valuable to validate this project and a need for data sharing or collection arises, we will follow the required procedures. For personal data, an approval request will be submitted to the ethics committe at KU Leuven (PRET/SMEC) and the approval will be communicated with FWO. Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes \"Optim software\" has the potential for being used in future valorization projects if a company is interested in applying the developed optimization methods under uncertainty for its own research. The computer code generated (i.e., the algorithms) have potential for commercial valorization. The code will be released as open-source where valuable for the research objectives. When potential for valorization is identified the benefits of a proprietary license will be analyzed first together with KU Leuven Research & Development. When releasing the code as open-source, this will either as modifications of the existing open source software under the GPL3 licence (pymedit, pyfreefem, nullspace-optimizer). An further software release will be the object of discussions with KU Leuven R&D department regarding the choice of a licence.
