In people\nwith Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) dexterity is compromised and medication only partially effective.\nHence, structured training of manual skills is indispensable. Despite the dopamine deficiency in PD,\nsome studies show beneficial effects of targeted motor learning with more efficient use of the intact\nneural networks. Still, the retention of practice often remains unstable. In healthy older adults, complex\ntraining proved to be beneficial for retention by recruiting a broader network. Currently, it is unclear\nwhether a similar approach will be beneficial for motor memory retention in PD. Therefore, this\nproposal addresses the neural correlates of dual versus single task training on the retention of\ntouchscreen skills, hypothesizing greater efficiency within compensatory networks after dual task\npractice. As PD is an enormously heterogeneous disorder and progressive, it is unlikely that all patients\nwill benefit from dexterity training. Consequently, in a large prospective cohort study, we will identify\nthe determinants for motor learning capacity and success, using a novel home training device. We will\nfocus on compliance as a key factor, the nature of which is largely unknown in PD. We expect that\ncompliance will interact mostly with the non-motor features of the disorder. Overall, this project will\nmake a great step forward in developing individualized rehabilitation programs for PD.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in\nthis project?\nA detailed protocol will be written, including research methods, practices, etc., as well as a blank copy\nof the informed consent form for the different work packages. Also, a document containing all\ninstruction for data collection has been written. These data will be stored in a Word file. Also, all\nquestionnaires is available. All steps in the methodology will be logged in an Excel file. \nFor the MRI data, the brain imaging data structure (BIDS) will be used to save the data\n(https://bids.neuroimaging.io/index.html). This also includes detailed .txt files containing all information\nregarding the different imaging types.\nThe behavioral data of the Swipe-Slide Pattern task is saved in a .txt file, which also contains the exact\ntime of performance.

Since we will be working with sensitive personal data that will only be pseudonymised as soon as\npossible. Only one record on paper and in an Excel file \"Subject Identification Code List\" links the\npseudonym to the personal data, this paper is stored in a locked cabinet inside a locked room, only\naccessible for researchers involved in the project (see below), the digital file is password protected and\nwill be managed by the PI (Alice Nieuwboer) and also stored on the secure L-drive.\n3. All paper copies of the desvriptive data and questionnaires will be stored in a secured locker at the\nDepartment of Rehabilitation Sciences, Building the Nayer, KU Leuven. Only authorized personnel will\nhave access to this locked storage room as they will need to be granted access by the PI (Alice\nNieuwboer).\n4.

However, only data of participants who granted their approval for re-use of data will\nbe made available. All participants are asked, via an informed consent procedure, whether the data\ncollected within this project may be re-used for other research purposes inside or outside KU Leuven.\nWith regards to the neuroimaging data, which does not allow for full anonymization even after\nremoving all personal information and defacing the images, data sharing will be restricted.
