While the former gives an indication of the charge and current distribution in\nthe nucleus, the radius allows to evaluate its size. Measurements of the lowest order EM moments and of the radius can be obtained with laser\nspectroscopy, a widely used experimental method which probes the hyperfine structure of atoms.\nIn this PhD project I will perform laser resonance ionization spectroscopy on the multi-quasiparticles states in 204-208Bi, by using the RAPTOR\nbeamline at the IGISOL facility. The goal is to study the correlation between the deformation of the nuclei and their radius by extracting the\nquadrupole moment and \n〈\nr^2 \n〉\n of the isotopes. Because Bi isotopes have only one valence proton outside the double-closed shell of 208Pb, their\nconfigurations are rather pure. Thus, the single-particle and collective degrees of freedom in the radii and moments are under control. Bi is also an\nideal case for high precision measurements: the high sensitivity of its atomic structure to the octupole moment \nΩ\n makes it a prime candidate to study\nthis largely unexplored nuclear property. To reach this goal I will perform laser-rf double resonance spectroscopy on 209Bi in the laboratory at KU\nLeuven and I will extract \nΩ\n by combining the results with the most recent atomic calculations.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n19-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
