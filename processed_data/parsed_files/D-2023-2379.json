Besides their low cost and easy\nprocessing, the popularity of MHPs arises from their outstanding optoelectronic properties, such as strong high-energy\nradiation absorption, and efficient charge carrier generation and transport, outperforming current market standards.\nHowever, the intrinsic instability and toxicity of popular lead-based MHPs hinders their large-scale application in\nsustainable detector technology. The ultimate goal of SPECTER is to rationally develop Pb-free MHPs through\ncompositional and dimensionality engineering, and perform their in-depth characterization towards application as\nphotoactive media in next-generation high-energy radiation detectors. These will facilitate low-dose medical imaging,\nsecurity and transport screening, and high- energy physics research. High-quality Pb-free MHP single crystals will be\nprepared, followed by carefully selected metal contact deposition. The (opto-)electric properties of the materials will be\nexplored by a full arsenal of both established and unique characterization techniques, enabled by the complementary\ntool set of both SPECTER partners. Additionally, stability tests will be performed at versatile conditions: biasing, elevated\ntemperature, humidity, long-term high-energy irradiation. The obtained functionalities will be critically analyzed and the\nintrinsic strengths and limitations of the material will be assessed. A fundamental understanding of the intrinsic\nrelationships between the chemical composition, structure, charge carrier transport, defects, and material stability, will\nsteer successive feedback loops of MHP crystal growth & characterization (4 to 6 iterations between KUL and CU\nexpected), in order to rationally improve detector stability and performance.\nLast modified: \n31-07-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
