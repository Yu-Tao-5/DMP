The reconstructed network s presented in ODIS will firstly be used \nto quickly become familiar with the contours of the social relations in the Southern Netherlands  \n(Antwerp/ Leuven) . Yet, the ODIS platform is designed as a living networking tool rather than a static \nrepresentation. To this end, it makes it possible for researchers to extend upon existing databases, which \nin turn transforms the reconstructed network. Thereby, this proje ct transforms the existing scholarly \nnetwork created in ODIS.  This data will be complimented with a data dump from the Short Title Catalogue \nFlanders (STCV) , a .csv version of the relevant information has been provided by the current co -ordinator \nHeleen Wyffels.  \n \nFor the Northern Netherlands, the project will combine the bibliographical information included in the \nSTCN (in collaboration with the current STCN team, incl.

RDM Guidance on data If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type . The project builds upon large -scale bibliographical and biographical inventories on early modern book production in the Low Countries. For the Southern Netherlands, t his project builds upon existing databases preserved in the online ODIS infrastructure aimed at construing early modern printers and scholarly networks , most notably that of Dieter Cammaerts and Violet Soen, Manuale Lovaniense (2021); and Heleen Wyffels, Violet Soen and Johan Verberckmoes, Impressae (2020). The reconstructed network s presented in ODIS will firstly be used to quickly become familiar with the contours of the social relations in the Southern Netherlands (Antwerp/ Leuven) . Yet, the ODIS platform is designed as a living networking tool rather than a static representation. To this end, it makes it possible for researchers to extend upon existing databases, which in turn transforms the reconstructed network. Thereby, this proje ct transforms the existing scholarly network created in ODIS. This data will be complimented with a data dump from the Short Title Catalogue Flanders (STCV) , a .csv version of the relevant information has been provided by the current co -ordinator Heleen Wyffels. For the Northern Netherlands, the project will combine the bibliographical information included in the STCN (in collaboration with the current STCN team, incl. Eric Vos, Esther van Gelder and Sylvia van Zanen) and the USTC (Arthur der Weduwen), and connected (in collaboration with the CREATE -team) to Ecartico (KNAW/Huygens ING , Leon van Wissen, Judith Brouwer, Harm Nijboer ).

Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata . Through the means of a README.text file, we will make the collected data as comprehensible as possible for future researchers. The majority of the transferable data will be biographical and bibliographical information that is set to be incorporated in the ODIS networking tool , as well as in the different STC’s . This will be realized in close collaboration with the two coordinators of these datasets, resp. Heleen Wyffels (STCV) and Esther van Gelder (STCN). In order to meet the international stand ard unique identifiers wil l be used, both on the level of the books (STC -IDs) and agents (VIAF) Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : The bibliographical guidelines of the STC’s will be followed. See the STCV and STCN handbooks. If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11 Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data. ☐ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I -drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on -premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☐ Other: How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? ☒ Standard back -up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back -ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If no, please specify : How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . Guidance on security for research data All data will be stored at dataserver facilities at KULeuven. These dataservers are highly secured. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12 What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? All costs of the storage above are covered by the faculty 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). Guidance on data preservation ☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be ke pt for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data . Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide . ☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? A cost estimate will be made with regard to the long -term storage of data on the faculty's network drives. In light of the type of data to be stored, this cost can be safely assumed to be relatively small and fundable out of the project budget FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13 6.
