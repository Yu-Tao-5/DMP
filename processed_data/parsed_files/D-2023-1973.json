Malaria incidences show considerable temporal and\ngeographical variation, which can be linked at least partly to climatic conditions. Over the last twenty years, multiple Malaria Early Warning Systems\n(MEWS) have been developed. These systems primarily focus on short-term incidence predictions, but there is a growing demand to implement long-\nterm predictions that are informed by climatic variables. This project intends to develop a geostatistical long-term forecasting framework for malaria\nincidence with an emphasis on the effects of climate-related conditions. Statistical methodology will be developed that makes use of spatial\nmultivariate time series analyses, distributed lag models, and joint models for multiple data sources, in order to flexibly model spatio-temporal\nvariation in malaria incidence and how this is affected by climatic events. These methods will be embed in a MEWS, which prioritizes applicability\nand interpretability for healthcare workers and policy-makers in developing countries. \nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n02-05-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

It was signed on November 21, 2021. It is stated that the data is the property of the provider, and it will be used only for planning purposes at KU Leuven and UHasselt. Only my team of supervisors and I have access to it. In addition, I must use the data under contract for nonprofit proposes, implementation and capacity building to the public health benefit within the project plans. Except for normal computations required, I should not try to modify in any way the data for different proposes other than the ones stated in the research proposal. The data cannot be transferred to anyone who is not part of the supervisory team without any prior written consent from the provider institution. Furthermore, I cannot use the data for commercial, research or consulting proposes in which I or the universities I'm affiliated with obtain rights of research results without the prior written consent of the provider institution.

Each dataset has a data dictionary associated that contains the variable name, the readable variable name, the measurement units, the allowed values, and the definition of the variable. Additionally, the scripts used to transform and use the data are and will be commented on, explaining the purpose of the script and the expected result of each piece of code. These scripts are available in R. Documentation of the R package will be provided following the guidelines of CRAN. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data?

Where will the data be stored? The data are stored in two cloud-based storage services, OneDrive from KU Leuven and Google Drive from UHasselt. The access is granted to the four supervisors and nobody else has access to it. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Since the data is stored in two cloud-based storage services, each one works as a backup for the other. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes All KU Leuven personnel has access to 2 TB of data storage on OneDrive. As the estimated sizes of the datasets <100 GB, sufficient storage and backup capacity are available. Likewise, all UHasselt personnel has access to 2 TB of data storage on google drive. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?

Upon agreement with the National Malaria Control Program and following the recommendations of KU Leuven, the weekly and monthly malaria case information, as well as the environmental information, will be retained for ten years. In addition, any manipulation of the data, e.g. aggregation, will be retained. The ten years period is for the purpose of reproducibility, verification and potential reuse. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? The data will be archived in the file storage located in the central KU Leuven datacenters. Collaboration is possible inside and outside KU Leuven.
