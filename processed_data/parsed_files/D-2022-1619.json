The FWO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 \nmonths after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the \nhost institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final \nevaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this  \ntemplate.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard  \nDMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research \ninstitutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning.  \nTo increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Pedro Fardim – ORCID -  0000-0003-1545-3523\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Femke De Ceulaer – Doctoral student - researcher\nProject number1 & title NEOTERIC BIOMATERIALS FOR HIPSCS MONITORIZED DIFFERENTIATION TO RGCS: CREATION, \nMICROFABRICATION & MICROFLUIDICS\nFunder(s) GrantID2G0K9622N\nAffiliation(s) x KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nProvide ROR3 identifier when possible:  \nPlease provide a short project description\nMatrigel is a benchmark costly supporting material for cell culture, being a basement membrane matrix  \nextracted from Engelbreth–Holm–Swarm murine sarcomas , presenting ethical issues, low productivity,  \nlow batch-to-batch reproducibility, and an extraordinary complex physicochemical nature. Therefore, highly \nreliable and tuneable materials  adequate for large-scale production to replace Matrigel are desirable. \nbioMAT4EYE will address this need by joining several multidisciplinary research teams with key expertise in  \nbiomaterial production  (fermentation, extraction), physicochemical modification and conformation in 2D, \n2D+  and  3D  structures  by  diverse  technologies,  micro-bioreactor  design,  construction  and  \nphysicochemical control, and  hiPSCs generation, culture and monitored differentiation  to RGCs.

All laboratory experimental details and data will be recorded daily and dated in dedicated laboratory notebooks and scrutinized at lab meetings. These records will be durable, accessible, and made safe from tampering or falsification. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 8How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.Electronic records of the data will be generated (e.g. Excel spreadsheets etc) and saved to the University server (which is automatically backed up daily) and also at laboratory hard discs . Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: We will online capibilites of One Drive server of KU Leuven and physical har drives of 2 T available at teh lab of Porf. Fardim If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7The access of to data will be controlled and restricted via authorized passwords that will be changed at least once a year. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Data storage at University server will be provided by KU Leuven. Data storage in hard disks will supplied by project funding in consumables. The expected cost is 200 euro for the whole duration of the project. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 95. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).Biofabrication, different types of synthesis, analytical data and project management data will be stored for at least 5 years, preferably 10 years. There is no restriction for data storage. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?Yes, at least 5 years, preferably 10 years What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?The costs for data preservation will be be coverd by research expenses of Prof. Fardim. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 106. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS.

Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☒ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify: There is a signed consortium agreement Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.The data will be made available to consortium partners during the project period. We will use online platform, preferably One Drive dedicated to the proejct and with defined folders for each datased as described in 2. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.01.12.2023 Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 Data from the project taht can be shared will be made available under a creative commons attribution license (cc- by 4.0), so that users have to give credit to the original data creators Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes: What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? We will use One Drive from KU Leuven and a solid hard disk for storage and back-up. In case of costs, we will cover with project funding. 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 127.
