The F WO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official  start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO \nbut to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel.  Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.  \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation  Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives  of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions.  This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary  of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.  \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   2 \n 1.

However, \noptimal treatment of intrinsic muscle impairment is hindered by insufficient understanding of its \npathogenesis. To enhance muscle growth  in CP, individualized treatment plans that include all influencing \nfactors on muscle growth are needed. Yet, longitudinal studies investigating both muscle growth and \ninfluencing factors in one cohort are lacking. We aim to unravel potential influencing f actors on altered \nmuscle growth, by studying intrinsic muscle impairments in relation to neuromuscular symptoms, physical \nactivity, nutrition and treatment, and by launching pathways for optimized treatment. A first part involves \nlongitudinal assessments o f intrinsic muscle impairment using muscle imaging, combined with measures of \nneuro -muscular symptoms (spasticity, strength, gait), physical activity trackers, food diaries and treatment \nhistory in growing CP children. This multidimensional dataset creates  the opportunity to perform unique \ndata integration to delineate potential mechanisms to impaired muscle growth. In a second part, we will \ninvestigate the effect of a novel multicomponent intervention to accelerate recovery of reduced muscle \ngrowth induced  by spasticity treatment, by combining strength training with nutritional supplements in a \nrandomized controlled trial. This project will pave way for optimized treatments, ultimately leading to \nimproved motor functioning.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   4 \n 2.

The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.

However, optimal treatment of intrinsic muscle impairment is hindered by insufficient understanding of its pathogenesis. To enhance muscle growth in CP, individualized treatment plans that include all influencing factors on muscle growth are needed. Yet, longitudinal studies investigating both muscle growth and influencing factors in one cohort are lacking. We aim to unravel potential influencing f actors on altered muscle growth, by studying intrinsic muscle impairments in relation to neuromuscular symptoms, physical activity, nutrition and treatment, and by launching pathways for optimized treatment. A first part involves longitudinal assessments o f intrinsic muscle impairment using muscle imaging, combined with measures of neuro -muscular symptoms (spasticity, strength, gait), physical activity trackers, food diaries and treatment history in growing CP children. This multidimensional dataset creates the opportunity to perform unique data integration to delineate potential mechanisms to impaired muscle growth. In a second part, we will investigate the effect of a novel multicomponent intervention to accelerate recovery of reduced muscle growth induced by spasticity treatment, by combining strength training with nutritional supplements in a randomized controlled trial. This project will pave way for optimized treatments, ultimately leading to improved motor functioning. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 4 2.

All data will be coded. - Approved Ethical Commission: description of study protocol (.pdf) - Informed Consents Form: original black copies (.pdf) and si gned hardcopies (printed paper) - Experimental protocols: description how the data are collected and generated (software, materials, set-up, settings (.docx) and how data are processed (software, protocol, guidelines, …) (.docx, read.me text files) - Measure ment forms: notes during data collection (printed paper) are stored in a locked closet. - Raw experimental data: storage of folders with original digital data in software -specific files - Processed data: folder with digital data in the software -specific files , spreadsheets with results (.csv, .xls) - Patient identifier record: name of included subject, and subject study code (.xls) . This patient record file is the only document that provide the link between the study code of the patient and patient’s identity . The patient identifier record (PIR) will be stored separately on another location than the subject recruitment files, using the service from UZ Leuven (password protected network location) to keep private data safe and this is supervised by the PI. - Patient data collection form (printed paper) : Data is collected for example, age, weight, height, short overview of assessments , ..) and a subject specific code is added . Printed paper , only with subject specific code, is stored in a locked closet . Because all experimental data are also used for clinical purpose, the metadata are primarily stored in the established clinical databases of the Clinical Motion Analysis Laboratory. Once metadata are extracted for research (for example for data analysis) , data files , which only contain the subject specific code , are extracted . FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : / If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: At the Clinical Motion Analysis Laboratory, raw exp erimental data are managed on a lab -specific data management platform for storing metadata, linking with safe storage of software -specific files, keeping track of data use and associated extra processing related to each experimental step, and enabling data query filtering of the collected data. The data management platform generates metadata and this will be done in a uniform and consistent way for all datasets. Metadata will follow Data Cite’s recommendations. 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Raw and processed digital data will be collected per assessment. Digital data files will be stored on secure KU/UZ Leuven servers and networks (UZ Leuven Drive: UZ/admin/ ganglaboresearch) .

The access to the KU Leuven server is u -number and password controll ed. Data on the UZ Leuven networks is only accessible for researchers with personalized UZ Leuven login and password, and thus secured by a strict access right management controlled by the PI. Patient record files will be stored with password security only accessible for researchers involved in the projects and controlled by the PI. Patient data can only be accessed by clinicians who are both involved in this project and who are taking care of these patients. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14 What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The storage space is provided by KU/UZ Leuven networks. Approximately two terabyte storage is anticipated as a need (approx 200€/terabyte/year). Costs are covered by research budgets ( 3D-MMAP: “ Evaluation of macroscopic muscle properties in infants and young children with cerebral palsy ”, available left budget of the Clinical Motion Analysis Laboratory (to initiate new storage facilities, as well for external hard drives), and budget fr om new projects (to sustain novel storage facilities)). 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). Raw data will be stored for a 10 year period af ter the end of the project , in accordance with the KU Leuven guidelines . All processed data will be stored for a 20 year period after the end of the project, in accordance with ethics committee guidelines . Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? The digital data will be archived at special space provided by KU/UZ Leuven networks with restricted access, controlled by the PI. Hard copies (eg. the Informed Consent forms, measurement forms and paper lab notebooks) are kept in locked cabinets in the lab of the PIs concerned. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? For this project data storage of 1Tb is anticipated, resulting in a cost of approx 200€/terabyte/year. Costs will be covered by research budgets (3D -MMAP: “Evaluation of macroscopic muscle properties in infants and young children with cerebral palsy”, a vailable left budget at the KU Leuven (to initiate new storage facilities), and budget from new projects (to sustain novel storage facilities)).
