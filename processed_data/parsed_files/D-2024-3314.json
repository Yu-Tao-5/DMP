Hybrid electrochemical layered micromanufacturing involves sequential application of selective\nelectrochemical accretion and micromachining and has demonstrated advanced capabilities in processing of electrically conductive\nmaterials regardless of their hardness. In this line, this project will conduct research investigations on sequential electrochemical\naccretion and micromachining of a wear-resistant high entropy alloy with potential application e.g. as modular mould inserts for ceramic\npowder injection moulding. The prime goal of this project is to develop and analyse a hybrid EC layered micromanufacturing process for\nmanufacturing a high entropy alloy (HEA) three-dimensional cavity in a prototype modular mould insert and unravel the complex\nrelationship between electrochemical accretion and removal process and the material (HEA) at the fundamental level. To fulfil this, the\nproject will conduct systematic and comprehensive investigations on developing multiple aspects of this process ranging from\nidentification of process requirements, process parameter regimes, electrolyte composition, in-depth analysis of accretion/removal\nmechanisms at macro- and micro level and functionality tests on prototype insert using ceramic powder injection moulding\ninfrastructure.\nID: \nID: \n214300\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-10-2024\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n04-04-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
