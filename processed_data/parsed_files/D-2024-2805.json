STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: Where relevant, an adapted Dublin Core Metadata standard will be used. The fields are already described above. 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project publicFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data.☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☐ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☒ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☒ Other: imec sharepoint, imec OneDrive and imec data server units How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? ☐ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back-ups I make (specify) ☒ Other (specify) During the project data will benefit from an automatic back-up: -This is managed by Microsoft: The imec sharepoint is hosted on the Microsoft Cloud, which is a high available environment. Information on this environment is never automatically deleted, removal of specific information should be managed by the business. -If information is removed from this environment, it is moved to a \"Recycle Bin\". From this Recycle Bin it can still be restored by the user for a period of 93 days (or an admin in case the Recycle Bin was emptied). -After these 93 days, items are deleted, and Microsoft will keep a backup for 14 additional days. During this period restoration can still be requested through a Microsoft ticket. -After these 14 additional days, the data is permanently removed. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes, at imec data servers, which are expanded at any point it is necessary. ☐ No If no, please specify: publicFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data Data on SharePoint will benefit from the following security services: -User-authentication, multifactor authentication can be activated. All logins to imec environments are protected by a strong password (minimal 14 characters) combined with multi factor authentication. -Versioning system Versioning is enabled by default on our SharePoint/Teams' environment. This can be modified by workspace owner and is under full responsibility by the business user. -System-encryption This is managed by Microsoft as outlined in this article: Cloud data security measures in SharePoint & OneDrive - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Docs Making sure that data is shared with the right people is the responsibility by the business user. Confidential data will be user encrypted in addition to this: When creating documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx), the user is forced to assign an information classification label to the document (Public / Restricted / Confidential / Strictly Confidential) based on the sensitivity of the information. While this label provides a (visual) marker on the sensitivity level of the information, it will not encrypt the document by default. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Storage is available at imec at no added cost to the project. publicFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 115. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): imec sharepoint, OneDrive and data server units. After the standard retention period of 5 years, data will be subjected to evaluation. This will include weighing the potential value versus the costs of keeping it available. Decisions will be made by the data owners, in close collaboration with ICT service responsibles for archiving. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? publicFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 126. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☐ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☒ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: Some of the data can be provided to a third party under reasonable request (e.g. for publications or other collaboration possibilities). If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Internal imec employees related to the project can have access. Any external employee could get partial access under a reasonable request (e.g. for publications or other collaboration possibilities). Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☒ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify: publicFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Other data repository (specify) ☐ Other (specify) When will the data be made available? ☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☒ Other (specify) Upon publication, if it does not conflict with ongoing intellectual property protection procedures. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT.

If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☒ No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? These costs will be covered in project overhead, except in case of circumstances that can be considered out of the ordinary. publicFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 147.
