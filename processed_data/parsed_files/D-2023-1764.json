The F WO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official  start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO \nbut to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel.  Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.  \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation  Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives  of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions.  This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary  of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.  \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   2 \n 1.

In \npatients with ischemic stroke the  obstruction of a blood vessel will result in neurological \nsymptoms  which can be temporarily if blood flow is restored in time, or  persistent if this will not \noccur in time, resulting in brain ischemia.  Identifying early ischemic changes and vessel occlusio ns \nis critical to  select patients for endovascular therapy. Automated analyses of  neuroimaging can \nassist physicians in the diagnostic pathway. The  development of brain ischemia is time dependent \nwith large  individual variation in infarct growth. The size of the baseline infarct  and the growth \nrate are predictors of the final infarct volume and  clinical outcomes. To increase the number of \npatients eligible for  endovascular stroke therapy and to improve the outcomes of patients  \nundergoing this therapy, it is  critical to develop treatments that slow  infarct growth before blood \nflow can be restored. Individual prediction  of baseline infarct and growth rate as proposed in this \nproject will  enable precision -based management of stroke patients for both  reperfusion  therapy \nand neuroprotective drugs. In addition,  development of models beyond prediction of infarct \ngrowth, but  focusing on functional outcome is needed. We aim to establish both  tissue - and \nfunctional outcome clocks which can be implemented in  clinical pr actice.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   4 \n 2.

To increase the number of patients eligible for endovascular stroke therapy and to improve the outcomes of patients undergoing this therapy, it is critical to develop treatments that slow infarct growth before blood flow can be restored. Individual prediction of baseline infarct and growth rate as proposed in this project will enable precision -based management of stroke patients for both reperfusion therapy and neuroprotective drugs. In addition, development of models beyond prediction of infarct growth, but focusing on functional outcome is needed. We aim to establish both tissue - and functional outcome clocks which can be implemented in clinical pr actice. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 4 2.

Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures u sed, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). As mentioned earlier for many of the projects we will use already existing data that is saved in secured and locked .csv files that come with a code ex planation file (readmefile) that can be found in the same folder as the dataset. The abbreviations that are used are as much as possible standard ones that are used in the literature as well. For the CRISP2 prospective study, study data will be collected in REDCAP (a database software that is metadata driven). This information will be transferred to .csv files that are locked when the inclusion of the study is finished. Also for this dataset we will use standardized abbreviations and will keep a code explanation file in the same folder. Working copies from the datasets can be created for processing and analysis.
