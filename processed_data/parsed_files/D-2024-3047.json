These scaled-up versions of protoplanetary disks\nform as the result of an unconstrained interaction process that takes place in the final evolution of\nbinary stars. The fate of these stars depends on the evolution and dispersal of their circumbinary\ndisks, as they are believed to interact dynamically. These stable discs must therefore play a lead role\nin the final evolution of a large population of binary stars, yet their structure, dispersal and\nevolution remains elusive.
