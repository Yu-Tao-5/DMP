The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Isabelle Vanden Bempt 0000-0002-3433-555X\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Not applicable\nProject number 1 & title S66276 \nOptical genome mapping for comprehensive genomic analysis of sarcomas in a diagnostic setting.\nFunder(s) GrantID 2G077723N\nAffiliation(s) X KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

The  identification of genetic  aberrations significantly  adds to a correct  \ndiagnosis  of  sarcomas,  which  is  strongly  associated  with  patient  treatment  and  outcome.  However,  \ndetecting these genetic aberrations in diagnostic practice remains a major challenge. While some sarcomas  \ncarry a characteristic genetic aberration, many remain poorly characterized or show multiple, complex  \naberrations that are difficult to detect using currently available methods. Therefore, we often need to  \ncombine different molecular and cytogenetic techniques making genetic testing of sarcomas unsatisfactory,  \nlabor-intensive and highly inefficient. We plan the implementation of Optical Genome Mapping (OGM), a  \nnext-generation cytogenetics tool that enables comprehensive, genome-wide detection of virtually all  \nclasses of structural variants including copy number alterations with high sensitivity. We assume that OGM  \nwill replace a number of standard genetic techniques by one single test which will dramatically change the  \ncurrent diagnostic workflow. Moreover, OGM will lead to the identification of novel genetic aberrations or  \nevents with diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic potential in especially poorly characterized sarcomas.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

How \nwill these costs be covered?The total estimated cost of data storage during the project has been estimated at is ~12,000 EUR. This \nestimation covers the following costs: the costs of digital data storage are as follows: 150€/TB/Year for the  \n“M-drive”. Raw data will be stored as Cloud storage at 25 Euro/TB/Year. We expect costs to drop slightly \nduring the coming four years as UZLeuven ICT is working on a new data storage cloud solution that is \nlower in cost (estimated to be available by the end of 2023). Therefore, this calculation can be an \noverestimation. Laboratory budget will be used to cover the costs for the validation samples (n = 60); for \nthe research part (n = 60) personal budget from the PI are used.  \n5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five \nyears (or longer, in agreement with other \nretention policies that are applicable) after the \nend of the project? In case some data cannot be  \npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this  \n(e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\n Guidance on data preservation☐ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy\n☒ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with \nmedicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans\n☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain)\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long-term)?\nDedicated data repositories  are often the best place \nto preserve your data. Data not suitable for \npreservation in a repository can be stored using a KU  \nLeuven storage solution, consult the  interactive KU \nLeuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR\n☒ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes)\n☐ Shared network drive (J-drive)\n☐ Other (specifiy):\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 10What are the expected costs for data \npreservation during the expected retention \nperiod? How will these costs be covered?The total estimated cost of data storage during the 5 years after the end of the project and extended \nstorage is still to be determined together with IT (project ongoing to offer cheaper long term storage \nsolutions). In any case, these costs can be covered by the laboratory (data validation samples) or the PI of \nthe project (own budget).  \n6. Data Sharing and Reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made \navailable for reuse after/during the project?  \nPlease explain per dataset or data type which \ndata will be made available.  \nNOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE \nDATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS \nAND USE MAY APPLY.

This estimation covers the following costs: the costs of digital data storage are as follows: 150€/TB/Year for the “M-drive”. Raw data will be stored as Cloud storage at 25 Euro/TB/Year. We expect costs to drop slightly during the coming four years as UZLeuven ICT is working on a new data storage cloud solution that is lower in cost (estimated to be available by the end of 2023). Therefore, this calculation can be an overestimation. Laboratory budget will be used to cover the costs for the validation samples (n = 60); for the research part (n = 60) personal budget from the PI are used. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☐ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☒ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?The total estimated cost of data storage during the 5 years after the end of the project and extended storage is still to be determined together with IT (project ongoing to offer cheaper long term storage solutions). In any case, these costs can be covered by the laboratory (data validation samples) or the PI of the project (own budget). 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☐ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☒ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Access to the data is restricted to the dedicated study team and within the context of the current study. For re-use, a novel project must be submitted describing what the data will be used for and needs approval by the ethics committee. Published results are of course open for discussion and comparison. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☒ Yes, intellectual property rights ☒ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify: If novel biomarkers or profiles are identified; intellectual property rights. Personal data will only be published after de-identification and no patient identifiers will be published. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Other data repository (specify) ☒ Other (specify) Upon publication, all (pseudonymized) patient details supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available as supplemental information. Omics datasets will be deposited in open access repositories such the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).

If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. Check the RDR guidance on licences for data and software sources code or consult the License selector tool to help you choose. ☐ CC-BY 4.0 (data) ☒ Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) ☐ MIT licence (code) ☐ GNU GPL-3.0 (code) ☐ Other (specify) Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☒ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☐ No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? We assume data management costs will be minimal by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to- use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. 7. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project?Metadata will be documented by the PhD student and PI, as well as dedicated technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook) that refer to specific datasets. Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project?The PhD student, technical staff and PI will ensure data storage and back up, with support from UZ-IT staff. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13Who will manage data preservation and sharing?The PI is responsible for data preservation and sharing, with support from UZ-IT staff. Who will update and implement this DMP? The PI is ultimately responsible for all data management during and after data collection, including implementing and updating the DMP."
