In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. data type which data will be made available. Yes, in an Open Access repository The annotated datasets of the corpora made of texts available in the public domain, the data protocols, my R scripts and the various visualizations and graphs will be made available in Open Access (but not the annotated datasets of the corpora made of texts not publicly available, and not my supervisor's scripts). However my personal notes about the literature or my thoughts and observations about the data are not relevant for sharing. For the bibliographic information, that still needs to be decided. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.
