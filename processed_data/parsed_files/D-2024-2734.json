The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Thibault Debord - 0000-0001-6971-4093\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles PI – Hans Steenackers (https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5021-2069)\nProject number 1 & title  The Impact of Biofilm Structure and Heterogeneity on Bacterial Evolution - 11PV924N\nFunder(s) GrantID 211PV924N\nAffiliation(s) X KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\nPlease provide a short project description Bacteria typically live embedded in structured  communities known as biofilms. It has been shown that  living \nin these structured environments can impact bacterial evolution, especially in the context of antibiotic  \nresistance development and the stability  of cooperation. However, biofilms are  highly heterogeneous  \nenvironments with varying architectural properties. Due to the limited spatial  resolution of the current  \nstate-of-the-art, often  comparing biofilm to planktonic cultures at population level, it is unclear how biofilm  \nheterogeneity  impacts  evolution.  We  hypothesize  that  the  local  biofilm architecture  can  have  a  \nsignificant impact on the evolutionary dynamics by altering both the supply  of novel mutants (~diversity)  \nand the evolutionary success of emerging mutants (~selection). In this project we will therefore  study the \ninfluence of the spatial architecture of biofilms on the emergence and evolutionary  success of antibiotic  \nresistant mutants and biofilm-deficient cheaters. Overall, this project will allow  us to study bacterial  \nevolution at an unprecedented spatial resolution.\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number. This question is optional.

FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data The electronic lab notebook is only accessible through KU Leuven Single Sign On. To access the data, each user should have a valid KU Leuven intranet user ID and password. Access can be regulated more specifically by the local admin of the SharePoint site. The biological samples are stored in freezers at the facility, where access requires a valid KU Leuven ID and a key that is kept in secure offices. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?The ELN does not carry any costs. The storage of SharePoint data costs 372.04 € the first year and 295.04€/year thereafter. All large data storage will be done on the interal KU Leuven server, where our lab has a J-drive (503.66€/TB/year) and a K-drive (104.42€/TB/year). The costs will be covered by the project. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☐ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☒ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Users will be able to access the data under permission of Hans Steenackers, PI of the project. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Other data repository (specify) ☐ Other (specify) When will the data be made available? ☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. Check the RDR guidance on licences for data and software sources code or consult the License selector tool to help you choose. ☒ CC-BY 4.0 (data) ☐ Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) ☐ MIT licence (code) ☐ GNU GPL-3.0 (code) ☐ Other (specify) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☒ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☐ No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? 7.
