The primary data types are derived from in vivo imaging experiments \nperformed during behavioural tasks. These datasets are as follows:\nTwo-photon calcium imaging recordings:\n- Format: .tif (ScanImage TIFF stack format)\n- Estimated size: ~60 GB/day per animal\n- Purpose: High-resolution recordings of neuronal activity in layer 2/3 of visual cortex \nduring visual stimulation and task engagement. These data will be used to extract the\nreceptive field properties and behavioural modulation of individual neurons, and to \nlink them to their projection targets and transcriptomic profiles.\nEye-camera recordings:\n- Format: .tif (frame-by-frame imaging)\n- Estimated size: ~50 GB/day per animal\n- Purpose: Monitoring the pupil location and size in real-time during the imaging \nsessions. These data are used to control for changes in arousal and gaze direction, \nwhich influence visual cortex activity.\nFace-camera recordings:\n- Format: .tif or video format (depending on implementation; stored frame-by-frame \nfor synchronisation)\n- Estimated size: ~50 GB/day per animal (comparable to eye-camera)\n- Purpose: Recording facial expressions and upper-body movements. These data are \nused to extract motor and behavioural state variables (e.g., whisking, posture, \n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 5orofacial movements) for inclusion in models of neuronal activity, enabling the \nmapping of non-visual behavioural modulation across visual cortical areas.\nStimulus and behavioural event logs:\n- Format: .txt (timestamped event and stimulus metadata)\n- Estimated size: ~10 MB/session\n- Purpose: Precise logging of visual stimuli, trial events, and behavioural outcomes \n(e.g., wheel movements, rewards, etc). These metadata are critical for aligning \nexternal variables with neuronal activity during behavioural tasks.\nAll datasets are time-synchronised using shared acquisition clocks and will be used \ntogether to model neural activity using statistical tools such as generalized linear \nmodels (GLMs). These integrated datasets are foundational for achieving the project ’s\naims: to dissect the cell-type specific logic of information flow in visual cortex and \nuncover the link between function, connectivity, and molecular identity.\nOmics data\nIn addition to the imaging and behavioural datasets, this project will generate \ntranscriptomic datasets aimed at revealing the molecular identities of neurons \ninvolved in distinct visual streams. These datasets are:\nSingle-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets:\n- Format: Processed as .fastq files for raw reads, then converted to .h5ad (AnnData), \n.csv, or similar formats for expression matrices and metadata.\n- Estimated size: ~30 –50 GB per experiment, depending on sequencing depth and \nnumber of nuclei (targeting ~20,000 nuclei per condition)\n- Purpose: To characterise the transcriptomic identity of neurons with defined \nprojection patterns. Fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting (FANS) will be used to \nisolate nuclei from retrogradely labelled neurons in specific visual areas. These data \nwill allow clustering of cells by gene expression and comparison of transcriptional \nsignatures between feedforward and higher-order projection neurons, as well as \n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 6among converging streams.\nSpatial transcriptomics datasets (MERSCOPE platform):\n- Format: Multichannel fluorescence images (.tiff) of tissue slices, with accompanying \ngene expression data stored as spatial matrices (.csv, .json, or proprietary Vizgen \nformats)\n- Estimated size: ~100 –200 GB per brain region imaged, depending on number of \ngenes and resolution\n- Purpose: To spatially map the expression of a panel of several hundred genes within\nthe visual cortex. This dataset will be registered to functional imaging data to \ndetermine whether neurons ’ gene expression profiles correspond with their receptive \nfield properties and behavioural modulation. These data will also be used to test \nwhether transcriptomic cell types are anatomically or functionally segregated and to \nrefine existing transcriptomic classifications of layer 2/3 excitatory neurons.\nBoth datasets will be analysed in combination with functional and anatomical \ninformation to investigate whether transcriptomic identity is aligned with specific \nvisual streams, projection targets, or behavioural roles.

All of the code used to analyse the data will be documented and uploaded to an \nopenly accessible Github repository, with clear examples of how to interface with the \ndata. \nFor computations ran in central NERF computing facilities (nerfcluster-fs), a json file is\nautomatically generated for certain type of jobs as spikesorting, which contains \nmetadata. This contains information as input file, location of output file, computation-\ndate and parameters used along the calculation. Furthermore, in case of conda \nenvironments, an yml file is automatically generated which contains python packages\nand their versions. These files are saved in a directory choosen by an user, and \nautomatically copied to a directory managed by the admin of the system. These \nmetadata files augment the manner to reproduce results and a posrteriori \nunderstanding of data production. \n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 11Will a metadata standard be used? If \nso, describe in detail which standard \nwill be used.  If not, state in detail \nwhich metadata will be created to \nmake the data easy/easier to find and \nreuse.Yes\nThe metadata files automatically generated for computations executed at the \nnerfcluster-fs, are placed in a folder which is indexed by the job-scheduler (SLURM), \nwhich is accompanied by the execution date. Therefore, the manner to search for \nmetadata is slurmID-DD.MM.YYYY.

AT NERF, we have a data storage system with 327 TB capacity. The system has \nmultiple layers of protection to ensure long-term data retention. First, the system is \ndistributed into two datacenter sites which act as a mirror. Second, snapshots of the \ndata are taken regularly that allow recovering from accidental corruption or deletion \nof data. Third, the system screens the data on a regular basis to avoid data corruption\ndue to bit-rot. Lastly, the disks in each server are configured using RAIDZ2 (a type of \nZFS). \nNERF storage system for actual data, it is composed of two subsystems, one is a \ndedicated archive system and the another one is for Work In Progress (WIP). The \nformer is an object storage system, for which NERF has an active maintenance \ncontract with the provider (Cloudian), while the latter is a filesystem based on \nopenZFS. \nThe archive system serves to store data that needs to be kept long term (years) due \nto legal requirements or for a later analysis. This system is so-called “nerfhf01 ”. \nThe WIP system offers a high throughput which suits best for highly demanding daily \nIO operations. This system is so-called “nerffs13 ” \n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 13How will the data be backed up? The storage system at NERF has multiple layers of protection to ensure long-term \ndata retention.\nThe WIP server (nerffs13) has a \"twin\" server located in a different data center which \nacts as a mirror of the former. This provides data backup in case of full failure of the \nnerffs13, whether caused for severe hardware issues or in case the entire data center\nis compromised. Furthermore, snapshots of the data are taken regularly that allow \nrecovering from accidental corruption or deletion of data, which in combination with a\nRAIDZ2 (zfs-raid) configuration provides a strong data redundancy per server. Lastly, \nthe system screens the data on a regular basis to avoid data corruption due to bit-rot.\nThe archive system (nerfhf01) is a redundant system on itself, this is composed of \nseveral nodes distributed in multiple data centers. The nerfhf01 technology allows to \nhave one entire node down and data is not compromised.\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 14Is there currently sufficient storage & \nbackup capacity during the project? If \nyes, specify concisely. If no or \ninsufficient storage or backup \ncapacities are available, then explain \nhow this will be taken care of. Yes\nSTORAGE: the archive and WIP systems have roughly 500TB of capacity each, until \n2021. These can be expanded upon necessity and considering technical specs. This \ntask is managed by the admin of the system, who also performs the upgrades and \nprovides data storage monitoring and reporting \nBACKUP: the archive system, up-to-date, comprises 13 nodes (servers) distributed \nacross three server rooms located in different buildings. This yields a full data \nredundancy for long term storage data, which is protected even if more than one \nentire node fails. \nIn the case of the WIP system, this is composed of 2 servers placed in different \nbuildings. One of the servers is the one that users connect to, while the another one \nhas a copy of all the data which is nightly updated, yielding a strong data \nredundancy. Moreover, each of these servers are in in a RAID-Z2 configuration, \nmeaning that if until two disks fail at the same time, data integrity is preserved. \nWhat are the expected costs for data \nstorage and backup during the \nproject? How will these costs be \ncovered? \nAlthough FWO has no earmarked budget \nat its disposal to support correct research \ndata management, FWO allows for part of \nthe allocated project budget  to be \nused to cover the cost incurred.Based on the last two years expenses and data storage forecast, NERF costs for the \nstorage system comprises the hardware itself, and license and maintenance costs. \nThe former amounts to 45000 € per year and the latter to 15000 € per year. These \ncosts are covered by the NERF central budget.\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 15Data security: how will you ensure that\nthe data are securely stored and not \naccessed or modified by unauthorized \npersons? NERF servers are in imec campus at Leuven. Thus, we have strong network protection\nas provided by imec firewalls. Moreover, imec provides a dedicated VLAN for NERF, \nmeaning that only registered devices can access to the NERF network from the imec \ncampus. \nFor users outside of the imec campus, a Cisco AnyConnect VPN can be used to access\nto the NERF network. The VPN login authorization is setup by two factors \nauthentification for each user. This VPN is provided and maintained by imec. \nIn addition to that network security, the access to our storage servers from user \ncomputers is via SMB protocol. Therefore, each research group at NERF has their own\n“SMB accounts ” as setup in the storage server by the system admin. \nConsequently, whether a device in-imec-campust or out-imec-campus attempts to \naccess to the NERF network and thereafter to NERF storage servers, security layers \non the network side and server accounts have to be passed first. This strongly \nreduces the likelihood that unauthorized persons access to NERF data. \n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 166.Data preservation  after the end of the FWO project\nFWO expects that data generated during the project are retained for a period of minimally 5 years after the end of the\nproject, in as far as legal and contractual agreements allow.\nWhich data will be retained for the \nexpected 5 year period after the end \nof the project? In case only a selection \nof the data can/will be preserved, \nclearly state the reasons  for this (legal\nor contractual restrictions, physical \npreservation issues, ...).The minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied \nto all datasets. All datasets will be stored on the university's central servers with \nautomatic back-up procedures for at least 5 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM \npolicy.\nWhere will these data be archived (= \nstored for the long term)? Data that needs long term storage is stored in nerfhf01.\nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during these 5 years? \nHow will the costs be covered?\nAlthough FWO has no earmarked budget \nat its disposal to support correct research \ndata management, FWO allows for part of \nthe allocated project budget  to be \nused to cover the cost incurred.That amounts roughly to 60000 € per year, and will be covered by the NERF central \nbudget.\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 177.Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or \npreventing the sharing of (some of) \nthe data (e.g. as defined in an \nagreement with a 3rd party, legal \nrestrictions)? No\nWhich data will be made available \nafter the end of the project? Participants to the present project are committed to publish research results to \ncommunicate them to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting \npublications will be made openly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data \nmay be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested\nresearchers and/or potential new collaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. \nnegative data).\nWe aim at communicating our results in top journals that require full disclosure upon \npublication of all included data, either in the main text, in supplementary material or \nin a data repository if requested by the journal and following deposit advice given by \nthe journal. Depending on the journal, accessibility restrictions may apply.\nBiological material will be distributed to other parties if requested\nWhere/how will the data be made \navailable for reuse? In an Open Access repository, Upon request by mail\nWhen will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 18Who will be able to access the data \nand under what conditions?  Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly \navailable through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, \nmetadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse, \nand will be conform to community norms. These repositories clearly describe their \nconditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) \nPublic Domain Dedication, a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) or an ODC Public \nDomain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable).\nInterested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give \ncredit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. For data \nshared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure \nagreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly \ndescribe the types of reuse that are permitted.\nWhat are the expected costs for data \nsharing? How will these costs be \ncovered? \nAlthough FWO has no earmarked budget \nat its disposal to support correct research \ndata management, FWO allows for part of \nthe allocated project budget  to be \nused to cover the cost incurred.It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard \nprocedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the \nstart of the project, and by using free-to-use data repositories and dissemination \nfacilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the \nlaboratory budget. A budget for publication costs has been requested in this project.\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 198.Responsibilities\nWho will be responsible for the data \ndocumentation & metadata? Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data \ncollection and analysis, by taking careful notes in dedicated files (.csv, .md and .pdf).\nIn addition, as indicated in the section 11, jobs launched in the nerfcluster will \nautomatically create metadata, where the responsable is the system administrator of \nNERF.\nWho will be responsible for data \nstorage & back up during the project? As long as the data is in the central storage system of NERF, the responsable is the \nsystem administrator of NERF.\nWho will be responsible for ensuring \ndata preservation and sharing? The researchers involved and the PI.\nWho bears the end responsibility for \nupdating & implementing this DMP? \nDefault response : The PI bears the overall \nresponsibility for updating & implementing\nthis DMPThe PI is ultimately responsable for all data management during and after data \ncollection, including implementation ad updating DMP."

Furthermore, in case of conda environments, an yml file is automatically generated which contains python packages and their versions. These metadata files are placed in a folder which is indexed by the job-scheduler (SLURM), which is accompanied by the execution date. Therefore, the manner to search for metadata is slurmID-DD.MM.YYYY. This meta data is reachable by user at http://nerfcluster-fs:8080/singlejob , which is browsable from the nerf-network. 2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 125.Data storage & backup during the FWO project Where will the data be stored? AT NERF, we have a data storage system with 327 TB capacity. The system has multiple layers of protection to ensure long-term data retention. First, the system is distributed into two datacenter sites which act as a mirror. Second, snapshots of the data are taken regularly that allow recovering from accidental corruption or deletion of data. Third, the system screens the data on a regular basis to avoid data corruption due to bit-rot. Lastly, the disks in each server are configured using RAIDZ2 (a type of ZFS). NERF storage system for actual data, it is composed of two subsystems, one is a dedicated archive system and the another one is for Work In Progress (WIP). The former is an object storage system, for which NERF has an active maintenance contract with the provider (Cloudian), while the latter is a filesystem based on openZFS. The archive system serves to store data that needs to be kept long term (years) due to legal requirements or for a later analysis. This system is so-called “nerfhf01 ”. The WIP system offers a high throughput which suits best for highly demanding daily IO operations. This system is so-called “nerffs13 ” 2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 13How will the data be backed up? The storage system at NERF has multiple layers of protection to ensure long-term data retention. The WIP server (nerffs13) has a \"twin\" server located in a different data center which acts as a mirror of the former. This provides data backup in case of full failure of the nerffs13, whether caused for severe hardware issues or in case the entire data center is compromised. Furthermore, snapshots of the data are taken regularly that allow recovering from accidental corruption or deletion of data, which in combination with a RAIDZ2 (zfs-raid) configuration provides a strong data redundancy per server. Lastly, the system screens the data on a regular basis to avoid data corruption due to bit-rot. The archive system (nerfhf01) is a redundant system on itself, this is composed of several nodes distributed in multiple data centers. The nerfhf01 technology allows to have one entire node down and data is not compromised. 2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 14Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes STORAGE: the archive and WIP systems have roughly 500TB of capacity each, until 2021. These can be expanded upon necessity and considering technical specs. This task is managed by the admin of the system, who also performs the upgrades and provides data storage monitoring and reporting BACKUP: the archive system, up-to-date, comprises 13 nodes (servers) distributed across three server rooms located in different buildings. This yields a full data redundancy for long term storage data, which is protected even if more than one entire node fails. In the case of the WIP system, this is composed of 2 servers placed in different buildings. One of the servers is the one that users connect to, while the another one has a copy of all the data which is nightly updated, yielding a strong data redundancy. Moreover, each of these servers are in in a RAID-Z2 configuration, meaning that if until two disks fail at the same time, data integrity is preserved. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How will these costs be covered? Although FWO has no earmarked budget at its disposal to support correct research data management, FWO allows for part of the allocated project budget to be used to cover the cost incurred.Based on the last two years expenses and data storage forecast, NERF costs for the storage system comprises the hardware itself, and license and maintenance costs. The former amounts to 45000 € per year and the latter to 15000 € per year. These costs are covered by the NERF central budget. 2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 15Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? NERF servers are in imec campus at Leuven. Thus, we have strong network protection as provided by imec firewalls. Moreover, imec provides a dedicated VLAN for NERF, meaning that only registered devices can access to the NERF network from the imec campus. For users outside of the imec campus, a Cisco AnyConnect VPN can be used to access to the NERF network. The VPN login authorization is setup by two factors authentification for each user. This VPN is provided and maintained by imec. In addition to that network security, the access to our storage servers from user computers is via SMB protocol. Therefore, each research group at NERF has their own “SMB accounts ” as setup in the storage server by the system admin. Consequently, whether a device in-imec-campust or out-imec-campus attempts to access to the NERF network and thereafter to NERF storage servers, security layers on the network side and server accounts have to be passed first. This strongly reduces the likelihood that unauthorized persons access to NERF data. 2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 166.Data preservation after the end of the FWO project FWO expects that data generated during the project are retained for a period of minimally 5 years after the end of the project, in as far as legal and contractual agreements allow. Which data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).The minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets. All datasets will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic back-up procedures for at least 5 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)? Data that needs long term storage is stored in nerfhf01. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 5 years? How will the costs be covered? Although FWO has no earmarked budget at its disposal to support correct research data management, FWO allows for part of the allocated project budget to be used to cover the cost incurred.That amounts roughly to 60000 € per year, and will be covered by the NERF central budget. 2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 177.Data sharing and reuse Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? No Which data will be made available after the end of the project? Participants to the present project are committed to publish research results to communicate them to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made openly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new collaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. negative data). We aim at communicating our results in top journals that require full disclosure upon publication of all included data, either in the main text, in supplementary material or in a data repository if requested by the journal and following deposit advice given by the journal. Depending on the journal, accessibility restrictions may apply. Biological material will be distributed to other parties if requested Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? In an Open Access repository, Upon request by mail When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results 2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 18Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse, and will be conform to community norms. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication, a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) or an ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Although FWO has no earmarked budget at its disposal to support correct research data management, FWO allows for part of the allocated project budget to be used to cover the cost incurred.It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. A budget for publication costs has been requested in this project. 2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 198.Responsibilities Who will be responsible for the data documentation & metadata? Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in dedicated files (.csv, .md and .pdf). In addition, as indicated in the section 11, jobs launched in the nerfcluster will automatically create metadata, where the responsable is the system administrator of NERF. Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project? As long as the data is in the central storage system of NERF, the responsable is the system administrator of NERF. Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and sharing? The researchers involved and the PI. Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP? Default response : The PI bears the overall responsibility for updating & implementing this DMPThe PI is ultimately responsable for all data management during and after data collection, including implementation ad updating DMP."
