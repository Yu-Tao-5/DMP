Determining a new timetable when a disruption occurs is mostly done by relying on the experience of\nthe dispatchers. The goal of this project is to develop mathematical models that can support the dispatchers in their decision-making to minimize the\nimpact on passengers and freight trains. This will contribute to an overall better quality of service and more attractive railway services. The proposed\nmathematical models need to be useful in practice, hence they need to be easy to use by the dispatchers and a solution has to be found quickly. In this\nproject, frequently occurring pieces of infrastructure will be identified. Models are then developed to optimize the timetable when a disruption occurs\non each of those pieces. Together those pieces should cover almost the entire network. Disruptions in stations areas will also be considered.\nAdditionally, we examine the impact of delays that are already present on the proposed solution for the disruption. Finally, the methods developed in\nthis project will be extended to be applicable in case of maintenance. Hence, this project will develop useful decision making tools to improve railway\nservices for passengers and freight.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n01-03-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
