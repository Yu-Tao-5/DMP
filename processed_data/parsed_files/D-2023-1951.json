The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Margot Vanoppen, ORCID ID:  0000-0002-7041-2620\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Patrick Matthys, ORCID ID: 0000-0002-9685-6836 (promotor of the project)\nProject number1 & title  \nFunder(s) GrantID2198669\nAffiliation(s) ☐ KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nProvide ROR3 identifier when possible:  \n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number. This question is optional since not every institution has an internal project number different from the GrantID. Applicants can \nonly provide one project number.  2 Funder(s) GrantID refers to the number of the DMP at the funder(s), here one can specify multiple GrantIDs if multiple funding sources were used.3 Research Organization Registry Community. https://ror.org/\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 3Please provide a short project description Granulomas are aggregates of immune cells that can be found in both infectious and non-infectious \ndiseases. The core of granulomas consists of Langhans giant cells, which are multinucleated giant cells \noriginating from macrophage fusion. Although Langhans giant cells occur in multiple diseases, little is \nknown about their functioning and immunological activities, especially in diseases without apparent \ninfection. Blau syndrome and sarcoidosis are two inflammatory granulomatous disorders of interest since \nthey are characterized by Langhans giant cell-containing granulomas in various organs. In these diseases, it  \nis unclear why and how granulomas and Langhans giant cells are formed and to what extent they \ncontribute to the disease pathogenesis. In this project, we hypothesize that Langhans giant cells are key in \ngranuloma development and disease control. Starting from in vitro generated Langhans giant cells and \nfrom granulomatous tissue biopsies from Blau syndrome and sarcoidosis patients, we will uncover the \nformation, cell functions and immunological features of Langhans giant cells and granulomas. For this, we \nwill use cutting-edge technologies, including single-nucleus and single-cell sequencing, spatial \ntranscriptomics and in vitro technologies. Since Langhans giant cell-containing granulomas occur in a \nmyriad of diseases, we are convinced that this project can be regarded as a pioneer work to study the role \nof these multinucleated cells and granulomas in other diseases.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

    "clean_full_text": "FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 1FWO DMP Template - Flemish Standard Data Management Plan Project supervisors (from application round 2018 onwards) and fellows (from application round 2020 onwards) will, upon being awarded their project or fellowship, be invited to develop their answers to the data management related questions into a DMP. The FWO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 21.General Project Information Name Grant Holder & ORCID Margot Vanoppen, ORCID ID: 0000-0002-7041-2620 Contributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Patrick Matthys, ORCID ID: 0000-0002-9685-6836 (promotor of the project) Project number1 & title Funder(s) GrantID2198669 Affiliation(s) ☐ KU Leuven ☐ Universiteit Antwerpen ☐ Universiteit Gent ☐ Universiteit Hasselt ☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel ☐ Other: Provide ROR3 identifier when possible: 1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number. This question is optional since not every institution has an internal project number different from the GrantID. Applicants can only provide one project number. 2 Funder(s) GrantID refers to the number of the DMP at the funder(s), here one can specify multiple GrantIDs if multiple funding sources were used.3 Research Organization Registry Community. https://ror.org/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 3Please provide a short project description Granulomas are aggregates of immune cells that can be found in both infectious and non-infectious diseases. The core of granulomas consists of Langhans giant cells, which are multinucleated giant cells originating from macrophage fusion. Although Langhans giant cells occur in multiple diseases, little is known about their functioning and immunological activities, especially in diseases without apparent infection. Blau syndrome and sarcoidosis are two inflammatory granulomatous disorders of interest since they are characterized by Langhans giant cell-containing granulomas in various organs. In these diseases, it is unclear why and how granulomas and Langhans giant cells are formed and to what extent they contribute to the disease pathogenesis. In this project, we hypothesize that Langhans giant cells are key in granuloma development and disease control. Starting from in vitro generated Langhans giant cells and from granulomatous tissue biopsies from Blau syndrome and sarcoidosis patients, we will uncover the formation, cell functions and immunological features of Langhans giant cells and granulomas. For this, we will use cutting-edge technologies, including single-nucleus and single-cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and in vitro technologies. Since Langhans giant cell-containing granulomas occur in a myriad of diseases, we are convinced that this project can be regarded as a pioneer work to study the role of these multinucleated cells and granulomas in other diseases.

Experimental results will also be stored at the shared drive. Every experiment has an experiment number enabling to link all resulting data files to the correct experiment. Only members from the team will have access to these folders. Informed consents (physical data) will be safely stored behind lock and key by the primary investigator (Margot Vanoppen), only she will have access to these documents. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: Metadata standards are typically not used within our lab group. However, we ensure possibility to interpret and reuse the data when necessary and permitted. Every member of our lab has a folder on the shared J-drive where he/she can safe his/her data. All data regarding one experiment will be kept on the J- drive in one folder with experiment number, title, type of data and file size to ensure all information on a single experiment is kept together. In the protocols, we will describe all the reagents and kits used in the corresponding experiment as well as the patient and healthy control numbers. For microscopy experiments, every picture will be labelled with healthy control/patient number, experimental stimulus, and the magnification. Analyses, either in excel or R (for sequencing data) will be made available in the shared drive within the corresponding folder of the experiment. All patient information (age, gender, disease) will be registered in an anonymized way in the file containing all collected samples and every patient will receive an identification number. 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? -All data will be electronically saved on the KU Leuven OneDrive and a shared network drive (J- drive). Only members of the lab group that have permission to access the files have ICT permission. -Biological samples (blood and tissue) will be stored in the biobank. µ -Cell lysates (for total RNA isolation) and isolated RNA (for qPCR), cell supernatant (for MSD multiplex), and 96-well plates containing cells for Smart-seq2 will be stored in -80 °C in the biobank. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.Backup is secured daily by KU Leuven ICTS. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: The OneDrive has a limitation in storage capacity (2 TB) which will be sufficient for this project. If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7All the above-mentioned protocols, raw data and analyzed data are stored at a shared Rega drive which is IP protected. In order to secure our data, the shared Rega drive is exclusively accessible through a login connected to your personal KU Leuven account and password. The privacy of patients will be guaranteed through data anonymization and storage within the secured database of the UZ Leuven. The treating physicians that participate in this study, possess a personal account and password to access the patients’ data. Informed consents (physical data) will be safely stored behind lock and key by the primary investigator (Margot Vanoppen), only she will have access to these documents. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?The OneDrive (2TB) comes without charge, and should be enough for completion of this project. The FWO bench fee could be used to pay for extra storage capacity. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 155. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All data generated and biopsies (blood tissue) will be retained for minimally 10 years after ending the FWO project. This is because of the possibility of reuse of samples or data for new research projects. The informed consent includes a clause that permits later reuse of the obtained data. The cell cultures obtained will not be stored since this is biologically not possible. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?Data will be stored at the KU Leuven OneDrive for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?The OneDrive (2TB) comes without charge, and should be enough for completion of this project. The FWO bench fee could be used to pay for extra storage capacity.
