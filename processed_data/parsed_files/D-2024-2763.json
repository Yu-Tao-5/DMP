All raw data, together with detailed annotat ions \nand techniques are stored a J drive with automatic back -up (capacity of 1 TB). Addit ionally, my personal \ndata will be stored on a KU Leuven OneDrive with a capacity of 2 TB. These OneNote digital lab books contain \nintroduction, rationale, materials  & methods, execution, raw data, analysis method, results, conclusion \nsection and rationale for future experiments. Reported metadata includes sample coding eg. \"exp117 -c29\" \nand concomitant  storage of experiment sheets that in detail describe how every sample was treated.  \n \nFor every type of experiment, standard protocols are saved and referred  to in experiment descriptions. \nDeviations from these standard protocol versions are always mentioned. Sequencing files are always \nannotated according to this sample coding and include the primer that was used during sequencing. For \nNGS, a sample descripti on .docx file is kept along .docx and .txt files that describe the used analysis \ncommands. For readouts in multiwell -plates .txt files describing plate layout are saved next to the raw data \nfiles. For gel electrophoresis/Western blot/microscopy images/... .ppt files that show the location of each \ncondition or nature of each staining on the gel/blot/image are saved in the same folder as the raw data files. \nFor cloning/PCR procedures all details (incl. ordered DNA sequences) documented.  Finally, all samples w ill \nbe preserved in the appropriate freezers ( -20 °C or -80 °C) and cell lines will be stored in liquid nitrogen  \nlocalized in our laboratory . \n \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        10 \n Will a metadata standard be used to make it \neasier to find and reuse the data ?  \n \nIf so, please specify which met adata standard \nwill be used.

In case this will change in the course of the project, this change and its timing will be reported at \nthe end of the project. For all data common metadata are collected: title, author, data type, date created \nand data modified, file size, equipment reference (such as manufacturer  and model identification). \nDepending on the nature  of data additional metadata are collected. For instance, for Microscop y; channels \nused, fluorescence: wavelength.  \n \n \n \n \n4.

It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all materials tha t need proper management because they are valuable, diffic ult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentatio n/metadata. RDM Guidance on data If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type . NA Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number . ☐ Yes, human subject data ; provide SMEC or EC a pproval number: ☒ Yes, animal data ; provide ECD reference number: P174/2022 ☐ Yes, dual use ; provide approva l number : ☐ No Additional information : Will you process personal data4? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number). ☐ Yes (provide PRET G -number or EC S -number below) ☒ No Additional information: 4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 8 Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer , for example spin - offs, commercial exploitation, … )? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes , please comment : Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements , research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please explain: IP prote ction will be prioritised before disclosure. For this matter, I can rely on the in -house expertise of IOF manager dr. F. Christ and on the IP -cell of the LRD office at KU Leuven. 3. Documentation and Metadata FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9 Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures u sed, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata . For all experiments, all metadata is saved on digital files in such a way that a non -expert researcher will be able to reconstruct the experiment and analyse the data. All raw data, together with detailed annotat ions and techniques are stored a J drive with automatic back -up (capacity of 1 TB). Addit ionally, my personal data will be stored on a KU Leuven OneDrive with a capacity of 2 TB. These OneNote digital lab books contain introduction, rationale, materials & methods, execution, raw data, analysis method, results, conclusion section and rationale for future experiments. Reported metadata includes sample coding eg. \"exp117 -c29\" and concomitant storage of experiment sheets that in detail describe how every sample was treated. For every type of experiment, standard protocols are saved and referred to in experiment descriptions. Deviations from these standard protocol versions are always mentioned. Sequencing files are always annotated according to this sample coding and include the primer that was used during sequencing. For NGS, a sample descripti on .docx file is kept along .docx and .txt files that describe the used analysis commands. For readouts in multiwell -plates .txt files describing plate layout are saved next to the raw data files. For gel electrophoresis/Western blot/microscopy images/... .ppt files that show the location of each condition or nature of each staining on the gel/blot/image are saved in the same folder as the raw data files. For cloning/PCR procedures all details (incl. ordered DNA sequences) documented. Finally, all samples w ill be preserved in the appropriate freezers ( -20 °C or -80 °C) and cell lines will be stored in liquid nitrogen localized in our laboratory . FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which met adata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS W ITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☐ Yes ☒ No If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: Currently, the use of metadata standards has not been implemented in the daily routine of the research group. In case this will change in the course of the project, this change and its timing will be reported at the end of the project. For all data common metadata are collected: title, author, data type, date created and data modified, file size, equipment reference (such as manufacturer and model identification). Depending on the nature of data additional metadata are collected. For instance, for Microscop y; channels used, fluorescence: wavelength. 4.

CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . Guidance on security for research data Access to any of the locations used for data storage (KUL servers, KUL OneDrive and personal desktop) require explicit authorisation and are protected from outside access. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? OneDrive is free of use for KUL members. The pricing f or large data storage (L -drive) is financed through grant applications. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). Guidance on data preservation ☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be ke pt for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data . Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide . ☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☒ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): Digital versions of the lab books will be kept on OneDrive What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? These costs directly depend on the pricing of large storage drives of KU Leuven. These costs will be covered through grant applications. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE ’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILA BLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY . AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS . FOR MORE INFORMATION : HTTPS ://WIKI.SURFNET .NL/DISPLAY /STANDARDS /INFO-EU- REPO /#INFOEUREPO -ACCESS RIGHTS ☐ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☒ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: Data will be made available after publication in peer reviewed journals. Additional data will be made available on basis of data sharing agreements if requested by third party. Additional material (and associated data) will be made available on basis of material transfer agreements (MTAs). If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. All members of the laboratory of Molecular Virology and Gene T herapy are authorized to have access to all obtained digital and physical data after the project. Due to potential commercial value of the data, no general full open access will be provided by default before IP protection and publication. Data which will be shared with third parties will exclude commercial use and will require appropriate credit to the data owners. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restr ictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify : FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 14 Where will the data be made available?
