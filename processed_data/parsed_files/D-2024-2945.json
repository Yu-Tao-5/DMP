Its obligate localization to the plasma membrane is \naided by the trafficking chaperone PDE6D.\nWe previously showed that inhibition of PDE6D can block KRAS activity. However, current PDE6D \ninhibitors suffer from unfavorable properties and by design lack a KRAS selectivity. We recently \npublished that stabilization of the KRAS/ PDE6D complex can sequester KRAS via its specific C- \nterminus to the cytoplasm to inhibit it. We have identified small molecules, which could serve as \nstarting points for the development of a KRAS/ PDE6D stabilizer. Such 'molecular glues' are \ncurrently of highest interest in drug development.\nWe here propose the following objectives:\n1. To understand the cancer cell biological consequences of KRAS/ PDE6D complex stabilization.\n2. To develop proof-of-concept KRAS/ PDE6D-molecular glues and characterize them biochemically and \nstructurally.\n3. To determine the effect of identified molecular glues on inhibiting KRAS-driven oncogenicity. \nThis BE-LU collaboration between two RAS/ PDE6D expert groups, with highly complementary expertise \nin cancer cell- and structural-biology, will generate the first PDE6D/ KRAS complex\nstabilizing molecular glues with specific efficacy in KRAS-mutant cancers.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n04-07-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Protocols will be available in this ELN, and general protocols will also be available in the lab’s Benchling space. For images of agarose- and SDS-PAGE gels, they will be named yyyymmdd_lane-contents. For platereader data, they will be named yyyymmdd_protein_type of experiment with specific concentrations and calculations as well as excitation/emission wavelength, bandwidths, and G factor determination type will be noted down in the .xlsx file. Microscopy data will be named yyyymmdd_protein_type of experiment and specific parameters will be attached in the documentation.

Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Data will be stored on OneDrive for business on KU Leuven account (2TB storage space) larger data will be stored as File storage. File storage is all data storage where data is stored and managed as files within folders. File storage is offered via the SMB protocol or the NFS protocol. The NFS protocol is only for use from servers in the central KU Leuven datacenters, while the SMB protocol is also offered to clients outside the data centers (typically for user shares such as the I-disk). This is a highly scalable and flexible solution; the chosen performance level and volume size can be adjusted to your needs at any time. How will the data be backed up?
