It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all materials tha t need proper management because they are valuable, diffic ult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentatio n/metadata. RDM Guidance on data If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type . Data from different sources will be reused (from published books and papers, unpublished archival material, …). Persistent identifiers will be used , if available. For many of our (often unpublished) sources , no copyright applies . Proper citation should suffice for all our datasets . Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number . ☐ Yes, huma n subject data ; provide SMEC or EC a pproval number: ☐ Yes, animal data ; provide ECD reference number: ☐ Yes, dual use; provide approva l number : ☒ No Additional information : Will you process personal data4? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number). ☐ Yes (provide PRET G -number or EC S -number below) ☒ No Additional information: G-2024 -7762 Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer , for example spin - offs, commercial exploitation, … )? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes , please comment : 4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10 Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data y ou (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements , research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata . We will accompany our datasets with README -files. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reus e the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : We are looking into using GeoNames to make the F ilemaker database more user -friendly. If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data. ☐ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I -drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on -premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☐ Other: How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? ☒ Standard back -up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back -ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) On a regular basis, backups will be made of the data on external hard drives . FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12 Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If no, please specify : How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . Guidance on security for research data By keeping our data within our personal KU Leuven OneDrive, we make sure it is not accessible/modifiable by unauthorized persons. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? We have not calculated these costs in detail at this stage of the project. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13 Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual re strictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). Guidance on data preservation ☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be ke pt for 10 years (ex plain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data . Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide . ☒ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? We have not calculated these costs in detail at this stage of the project . 6. Data Sharing and Reuse FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 14 Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE ’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE , CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY .

If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Other researchers for research purposes only. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify : Where will the data be made available?

If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS . IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED , THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED . DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIB IT THAT .

If already available, please provide it here . INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA . ☒ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☐ No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? We assume none. 7. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project? Both PhD researchers. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 16 Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project? Both PhD researchers.
