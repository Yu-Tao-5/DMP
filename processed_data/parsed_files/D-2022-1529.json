General Information\nName applicant\nMarkus Wöhr\nFWO Project Number & Title\nG0C0522N; Deciphering Socio-affective Communication through Ultrasonic\nVocalizations in Rodents: Improving Translational Research Models for\nNeuropsychiatric Dysfunctions \nAffiliation\nKU Leuven\n2. Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nResearch activities in G0C0522N will result in a variety of data types. Data types include\nprimarily: (1) video files (rat behavior, avi-files or mp4-files, circa 4-5 TB, recorded with video\ncameras connected to a computer) and (2) audio files (rat ultrasonic vocalizations, wav-files,\ncirca 4-5 TB, recorded with ultrasound microphones connected to a computer). Additionally, (3)\nautomated behavioral measurements (e.g. locomotor activity, nose-poking) will be recorded in\nExcel (xlsx-files, circa 2-3 MB, recorded with infrared light sensors connected to a computer). Of\nnote, recordings of rat ultrasonic vocalizations are relatively large in size, with one hour of\nrecording resulting in about 2 GB. Video files will likewise result in a significant amount of data.\nOther datatypes will include electrophysiological recordings, images from fluorescence\nmicroscopy of rat brain sections (e.g. for neuromorphological analyses) as well as biochemical\nand molecular biology data (e.g. western blot, agarose gels, qRT-PCR, varia, not expected to\nexceed 400 GB over the course of the project, details still need to be determined as ordering of\nrelevant equipment is still ongoing).\nAll data will be stored in digital form (e.g. AVI or MP4 files for video recordings, WAV files for\naudio recordings, TIFF files for gel images, BAM files for RNA sequencing data). Measurements\nderived from video and audio files, microscopy images, sequencing datasets, etc. will be\nrecorded in Excel (for long-term preservation, converted into CSV files) and SPSS for statistical\nanalyses. Manuscripts will be written in Word. Biomaterials include rat brain and tail samples.\n3. Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNo\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 4\nYes\nECD, formal approval by the relevant ethical review committee was obtained for parts of the\nproject (P017_2022 and P179_2021) but not other parts of the project (pending).\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nStandardized protocols (SOPs, including all relevant details of experimental setup and\nprocedures) will be applied and enforced by the head lab manager/ lab technician.\nFor video files (rat behavior) the following information will be noted: rat ID(s), date, time,\nprotocol (i.e. SOP), and experimenter. The methodology and protocol will be described in detail in\nthe lab book.\nFor audio files (rat ultrasonic vocalizations) the following information will be noted: rat ID(s),\ndate, time, protocol (i.e. SOP), and experimenter. The methodology and protocol will be\ndescribed in detail in the lab book.\nFor automated behavioral measurements (e.g. locomotor activity, nose-poking) the following\ninformation will be noted: rat ID(s), date, time, protocol (i.e. SOP), and experimenter. The\nmethodology and protocol will be described in detail in the lab book.\nFor other datatypes the following information will be noted: rat ID(s), date, time, protocol (i.e.\nSOP), and experimenter. The methodology and protocol will be described in detail in the lab\nbook.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nMetadata include a unique rat ID, together with its birth date, genotype, sex, and experimental\ncondition. All other data are linked to the individual animal through the unique rat ID only (but\nnot birth date, genotype, sex, and experimental condition) to avoid a bias during data acquisition\nand analysis. After completing relevant parts of the data acquisition process, data will be merged\nin SPSS linking all relevant data through the unique rat ID.  \n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nThere are several provisions in place in order to preserve the data during and after the end of the\nresearch. According to the Research Data Management policy at KU Leuven, all relevant research\ndata will be kept for at least 10 years after the end of the research. Data will be stored on hard\ndrives during experiments. After the experiments, data will be transferred to two external hard\ndrives (two copies; one working copy and one backup copy) and metadata will additionally be\ntransferred to the large, safe, and automatically backed up central network device of KU Leuven,\nOneDrive. In addition, it is planned to make exemplary audio files, i.e. recordings of ultrasonic\nvocalizations, available to the scientific community through an online platform similar to\nmouseTube. Furthermore, it is planned to upload metadata of key confirmatory studies to a\ngeneral repository (e.g. Open Science Framework). For optimal storage of biomaterials, fridges, -\n20°C freezers, and -80°C freezers will be used.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe data will be stored on external hard drives (two copies; one working copy and one backup\ncopy) and metadata will be additionally transferred to the university's central servers with\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 4\nautomatic daily backup procedures, for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nNo\nExternal hard drives (with a capacity of several TB) will be ordered before the start of data\nacquisition.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nCirca 2000 € for external hard drives, covered through FWO funding during the project period.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nData acquisition is performed in an animal laboratory with limited access. External hard drives\nand computers are bitlocker/ password protected and PhD and postdoctoral researchers will keep\nthe external hard drives in a cabinet that can be locked. \n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAccording to the Research Data Management policy at KU Leuven, all relevant research data will\nbe kept for at least 10 years after the end of the research. No selection is made.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nThe data will be stored on external hard drives (two copies; one working copy and one backup\ncopy) and metadata will be additionally transferred to the university's central servers with\nautomatic daily backup procedures, for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears?
