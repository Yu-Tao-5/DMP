Unfortunately, the majority of natural product biosynthetic\ngene clusters (BGCs) are not, or only minimally, expressed under laboratory conditions. This poses a\nmajor challenge to the discovery and functional characterization of novel natural products, especially\nin non-model bacteria. Current methods for activating and enhancing BGC expression, such as\nheterologous expression in model organisms, are costly, inefficient and require extensive screening\ncapacity. To overcome these limitations, this project aims to draw inspiration from Nature and exploit\nthe ability of phages to hijack and control bacterial metabolic pathways. Specifically, it aims to\nactivate and enhance the expression of natural product BGCs in non-model bacteria by integrating\northogonal, phage-derived genetic elements while taking into account the underlying regulatory\nmechanisms that modulate these pathways. As a proof concept, this innovative phage-based\nrefactoring pipeline will be applied to the identification of cryptic metabolites in five diverse\nPseudomonas species and to the yield enhancement of a natural product anticancer agent with\ntherapeutic potential. Together, these innovations will have broad translational applications and will\nprovide a much more efficient, sustainable and cost-effective means of generating industrially\nvaluable natural products.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n20-06-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Unfortunately, the majority of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are not, or only minimally, expressed under laboratory conditions. This poses a major challenge to the discovery and functional characterization of novel natural products, especially in non-model bacteria. Current methods for activating and enhancing BGC expression, such as heterologous expression in model organisms, are costly, inefficient and require extensive screening capacity. To overcome these limitations, this project aims to draw inspiration from Nature and exploit the ability of phages to hijack and control bacterial metabolic pathways. Specifically, it aims to activate and enhance the expression of natural product BGCs in non-model bacteria by integrating orthogonal, phage-derived genetic elements while taking into account the underlying regulatory mechanisms that modulate these pathways. As a proof concept, this innovative phage-based refactoring pipeline will be applied to the identification of cryptic metabolites in five diverse Pseudomonas species and to the yield enhancement of a natural product anticancer agent with therapeutic potential. Together, these innovations will have broad translational applications and will provide a much more efficient, sustainable and cost-effective means of generating industrially valuable natural products.

Yes, dual use Risk assessment strategy: Synthetic biology in general aims at re-writing biological systems to design new parts and devices for applications with high industrial and societal benefits. At the same time it raises concerns in terms of biosecurity, and can be considered as a “dual use research”. Considering this research program, which is of high scientific (and potential commercial) value, we remain mindful for potential abuse of this research. Research results will include the identification of new synthetic biology tools, sourced from nature, which can be optimized/engineered for introduction into (laboratory strain) bacteria. If this information or materials would fall into the wrong hands, the research and its tools would still require a highly advanced level of expertise and skill to convert the expected outcomes of this research into something which could harm people, animals or the environment. Risk mitigation strategy: - Researchers involved in this program will be trained to create awareness of any potential ethical or misuse implications of this research. This responsibility lies with my promoter as head of research within this project and will be achieved through discussions, making available relevant literature and by general adherence and scrutiny by the scientific community. - Our lab adheres to the standards required in terms of safety, according to the guidelines mentioned above.

How will the data be backed up? Data will be backed-up according to the standard back-up procedures provided by KU Leuven ICTS. This involves automatic version management of the files. Version management is done using \"snapshot\" technology, where the previous versions of the changed files are kept online in a snapshot on the same storage system. by default, 1 snapshot is taken daily and is kept for 14 days. So you can go back to previous versions of the file up to 14 days. end users can restore older files themselves from within their Windows PC via the \"previous versions | previous versions\" functionality.
