After completion of (sub)WPs, the data will be additionally stored on the KUL service servers. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Data are backed up on the cloud (OneDrive) immediately. The software indicates the update status (green, blue or red) and, in case of a non- sync, action can be taken using the online version of the tool. Data are further back up regularly on an external hard drive. After completion of (sub)WPs, data will be additionally backed up on the KUL service servers. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.

How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The accesses to OneDrive and SharePoint are only for researchers with permission. All users need to use a two-factor Authenticator (2FA app used at KUL). Furthermore, a log-out is always performed when leaving Lab PCs (where data is generated) to prevent modification of parameters by unauthorized persons.
