We do not know the reasons for the selective vulnerability of neuronal cells, and I will address this problem at the molecular level with this project. Amyloidogenic proteins contain aggregation-prone regions (APR) that drive their assembly into fibrils. Interestingly, the morphology of amyloid fibrils made of the same protein can differ considerably: fibrils of different morphology (“strains”) spread to different areas in the brains of patients and cause different diseases. Recent findings of the host laboratory suggest that different fibril morphologies are the result of interaction with other components present in the cellular milieu where the amyloid aggregates form. They demonstrated in two key articles that peptides similar to the APRs in the amyloid-forming protein could interact with disease-causing amyloids and alter their morphology. In short, the interaction of unrelated proteins with amyloidogenic proteins could explain how strains arise. In this project, I will study the mechanism of how polymorphs form at a molecular level. Additionally, I plan to contribute to our understanding of the biological relevance of these interactions by examining the structure of fibrils isolated from more complex environments, namely mammalian cell models and mouse models.           \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  4  2.

If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. If available, add the reference to your file in your host institution's privacy register. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes:  - Short description of the kind of personal data that will be used: - Privacy Registry Reference:   Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)?  If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please comment:  The project aims at determining high-resolution structures of amyloid polymorphs formed by disease-associated amyloidogenic proteins. Such structures are of high value as they may be the basis for design and development of specific binders that could modulate activity or toxicity of such amyloids. Therefore, we do hope that the proposed work will lead to tech transfer and valorisation of the research data. VIB and KU Leuven has a policy to actively monitor research data for such potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of cases the invention will be IP protected (mostly patent protection or copyright protection). As such the IP protection does not withhold the research data from being made public. In the case a decision is taken to file a patent application it will be planned so that publications need not be delayed. Further research beyond the scope of this project may be necessary for developing a strong IP portfolio.  Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)?  If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain:    6 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  9  Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use?

This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse.   If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created:       \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  11  4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project  Where will the data be stored?  Digital files will be stored either on KU Leuven servers or in shared laboratory folders of an off-site online backup service. The researcher working on the project will have copies of the data files as well as of the derived and compiled data stored on their personal computers. The Switch Lab has a professional subscription to an off-site online backup service with unlimited space, version control and roll-back capability, which will be used for storage during the project and after. There is a secondary on-campus physical backup of the online storage which synchronizes with the online content with a one-day delay. Cryo-EM raw data will be eventually uploaded to publicly accessible data storage servers such as EMPIAR. Protein structure files will be submitted to RCSB’s PDB database and the EM maps will be submitted to EMDB.   How will the data be backed up?  WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7  REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.

CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7  All notebooks and physical data are stored in the labs. Entry to the lab requires ID-card and key. Access to the digital data is u-number and password controlled.        What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Data storage and backup costs are included in general lab costs. The Switch Lab has a yearly subscription to an off-site online backup service paid from the general budget of the laboratory. The yearly cost of the service is 5500 Euros. This cost includes unlimited data storage, not only the data belonging to the present project. Electricity costs for the -80° and -20° freezers and refrigerators present in the labs as well as the cost of liquid nitrogen cryostorage are included in general lab costs.       5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project  Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this  (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). The minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets.   \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  13  Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? For the datasets that will be made openly accessible, we will use, whenever possible, the existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of publication.   For all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows: -Digital datasets will be stored on storage space of an online data-backup service. Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate.       What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?    Electricity costs for the -80° and -20° freezers and refrigerators present in the labs as well as for in liquid nitrogen cryo-storage are included in general lab costs. The cost of the laboratory's professional subscription to the online data backup service is 5500 Euros per year (27 500 Euros for 5 years). This cost includes unlimited data storage, not only the data belonging to the present project. Data storage and backup costs are included in general lab costs.      \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  14  6. Data Sharing and Reuse  Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?   Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available.

THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.  Upon publication of research results Generally, research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at the time of publication. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, potential IP requirements – note that patent application filing will be planned so that publications need not be delayed - or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be made publicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached.   \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  16  Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why.  A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT.  EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8    Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse and will be conform to community norms. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication, a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY)  or an ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of re-use that are permitted.   Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here.  INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.  ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes: Identifier not available yet  What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?   It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. The receiving party will pay for sharing physical data.    7.

If available, add the reference to your file in your host institution's privacy register. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes: - Short description of the kind of personal data that will be used: - Privacy Registry Reference: Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please comment: The project aims at determining high-resolution structures of amyloid polymorphs formed by disease-associated amyloidogenic proteins. Such structures are of high value as they may be the basis for design and development of specific binders that could modulate activity or toxicity of such amyloids. Therefore, we do hope that the proposed work will lead to tech transfer and valorisation of the research data. VIB and KU Leuven has a policy to actively monitor research data for such potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of cases the invention will be IP protected (mostly patent protection or copyright protection). As such the IP protection does not withhold the research data from being made public. In the case a decision is taken to file a patent application it will be planned so that publications need not be delayed. Further research beyond the scope of this project may be necessary for developing a strong IP portfolio. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 6 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9 Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). Metadata will be documented by the researcher at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook) and/or in hard copy lab notebooks that refer to specific datasets. All datasets will be accompanied by a README.txt file containing all the associated metadata (see more details below). The data will be generated following standardized protocols. Clear and detailed descriptions of these protocols will be stored in our lab protocol database and published along with the results. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: The following metadata standards will be used for certain datasets. • Protein structures will be saved in Protein Data Bank Format (PDB) (https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.9y4cqw) • Cryo-EM raw images and 3D maps will be stored in MRC format. • For instrument-specific datasets, additional metadata will be associated with the data file as appropriate. • For other datasets, the metadata will include the following elements: Title: free text Creator: Last name, first name, organization Date and time reference. Subject: Choice of keywords and classifications Description: Text explaining the content of the data set and other contextual information needed for the correct interpretation of the data, the software(s) (including version number) used to produce and to read the data, the purpose of the experiment, etc. Format: Details of the file format, Resource Type: data set, image, audio, etc. Identifier: DOI (when applicable) Access rights: closed access, embargoed access, restricted access, open access. The final dataset will be accompanied by a README.txt document. This file will be located in the top-level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used. This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse. If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Digital files will be stored either on KU Leuven servers or in shared laboratory folders of an off-site online backup service. The researcher working on the project will have copies of the data files as well as of the derived and compiled data stored on their personal computers. The Switch Lab has a professional subscription to an off-site online backup service with unlimited space, version control and roll-back capability, which will be used for storage during the project and after. There is a secondary on-campus physical backup of the online storage which synchronizes with the online content with a one-day delay. Cryo-EM raw data will be eventually uploaded to publicly accessible data storage servers such as EMPIAR. Protein structure files will be submitted to RCSB’s PDB database and the EM maps will be submitted to EMDB. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.

CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7 All notebooks and physical data are stored in the labs. Entry to the lab requires ID-card and key. Access to the digital data is u-number and password controlled. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Data storage and backup costs are included in general lab costs. The Switch Lab has a yearly subscription to an off-site online backup service paid from the general budget of the laboratory. The yearly cost of the service is 5500 Euros. This cost includes unlimited data storage, not only the data belonging to the present project. Electricity costs for the -80° and -20° freezers and refrigerators present in the labs as well as the cost of liquid nitrogen cryostorage are included in general lab costs. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). The minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13 Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? For the datasets that will be made openly accessible, we will use, whenever possible, the existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of publication. For all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows: -Digital datasets will be stored on storage space of an online data-backup service. Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Electricity costs for the -80° and -20° freezers and refrigerators present in the labs as well as for in liquid nitrogen cryo-storage are included in general lab costs. The cost of the laboratory's professional subscription to the online data backup service is 5500 Euros per year (27 500 Euros for 5 years). This cost includes unlimited data storage, not only the data belonging to the present project. Data storage and backup costs are included in general lab costs.

THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’. Upon publication of research results Generally, research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at the time of publication. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, potential IP requirements – note that patent application filing will be planned so that publications need not be delayed - or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be made publicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 16 Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse and will be conform to community norms. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication, a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) or an ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of re-use that are permitted. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes: Identifier not available yet What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. The receiving party will pay for sharing physical data. 7.
