In REDCap, the data dictionary can be found: this is a\nspreadsheet in CSV format representing the structure of the database, allowing the reproduction of the data collection\ninstruments. Further, when extracting data (without identifiers) from REDCap, the codebook will also be extracted to link the\nvariable names with the ‘field labels’ and ‘choice labels’. When the data in REDCap need to be edited, this is only done in\naccordance with the data manipulation standards as defined by and shared within the research team. The manipulation\nstandards are stored on the KU Leuven One Drive for Business service.

Only pseudonymised data (no identifiers) will be\nextracted from REDCap and stored on KU Leuven Business One Drive cloud services.\nAs part of the validation studies (datasets 2 and 3), the responses from healthcare professionals will be collected using\nLimesurvey, as the proposed system by KU Leuven.

Only authorized users with fixed roles (user rights) have access to the database. The\nBELpREG user rights are managed by the Clinical Trial Center (CTC). Access to REDCap (records) is automatically logged and\nchanges to the data are stored in independent audit trails. The BELpREG server and REDCap software are frequently upgraded\naccording to the procedures of ICTS gbiomed.\nThe validation study data (pseudonymized - datasets 2 and 3) are collected using Limesurvey, which also requires a login to gain\naccess. In the validation studies, physicians and/or midwives will receive patient identifiers and study code via the Belnet\nFilesender (encrypted) and will register data in Limesurvey by using the BELpREG study code of patients.\nDatasets 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 will be stored on the password protected cloud service of KU Leuven Business One Drive; computers will\nbe used which can only be accessed by using a login and password. A clean desk policy will be followed: no papers potentially\ncontaining personal data will be left unattended and visible. Screens of laptops will be locked when left unattended.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project?

The BELpREG data (dataset 1) are collected using REDCap software. In REDCap, the data dictionary can be found: this is a spreadsheet in CSV format representing the structure of the database, allowing the reproduction of the data collection instruments. Further, when extracting data (without identifiers) from REDCap, the codebook will also be extracted to link the variable names with the ‘field labels’ and ‘choice labels’. When the data in REDCap need to be edited, this is only done in accordance with the data manipulation standards as defined by and shared within the research team. The manipulation standards are stored on the KU Leuven One Drive for Business service. Our team has also published a paper describing the design and development of the BELpREG system, including a list of all BELpREG variables as supplementary material (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.01.23286625) Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data?

If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. Yes In the BELpREG register (dataset 1), some variables are collected using metadata standards. This is the case for names of medicinal products (ATC classification, through the SAM database), underlying medical conditions and indications of medication use (ICD-11 and MedDRA) and some sociodemographic variables (postal and NATO codes). For the other variables, the codebook will be used as metadata. For dataset 5, a metafile is being developed in collaboration with colleagues from UK, the Netherlands and Norway, with whom dataset 5 will be eventually shared. 3.

Last modiﬁed 07 April 2025 5 of 10 To ensure the security of the BELpREG data collected in REDCap (dataset 1), the BELpREG database (and backup) are being hosted on a separate KU Leuven server (separate from other REDCap projects). Only pseudonymised data (no identifiers) will be extracted from REDCap and stored on KU Leuven Business One Drive cloud services. As part of the validation studies (datasets 2 and 3), the responses from healthcare professionals will be collected using Limesurvey, as the proposed system by KU Leuven. At the end of the data collection, the data will be extracted and removed from Limesurvey and will be stored on KU Leuven Business One Drive cloud services. Anonymised / pseudonymised datasets (datasets 2-7) will be stored on secured KU Leuven Business One Drive cloud services. For datasets 2 and 3, the documents with the key for the study codes will be password protected and saved on the personal One Drive storage of the researcher. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? The BELpREG data (dataset 1) that are collected in REDCap follow the standard back-up procedures of KU Leuven gbiomed ICTS (with Gert Goos as REDCap administrator). For all other data, which are stored on KU Leuven Business One Drive cloud services, automated backups are made by KU Leuven ICTS following their standard procedures. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes The KU Leuven Business One Drive cloud storages allow storage of data up till 250 GB, the BELpREG server currently allows up till 100GB (which can be enlarged when needed). How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? BELpREG data are stored using REDCap, which is compliant with KU Leuven data security standards, and requires a multi-factor authentication procedure to gain access. Only authorized users with fixed roles (user rights) have access to the database. The BELpREG user rights are managed by the Clinical Trial Center (CTC). Access to REDCap (records) is automatically logged and changes to the data are stored in independent audit trails. The BELpREG server and REDCap software are frequently upgraded according to the procedures of ICTS gbiomed. The validation study data (pseudonymized - datasets 2 and 3) are collected using Limesurvey, which also requires a login to gain access. In the validation studies, physicians and/or midwives will receive patient identifiers and study code via the Belnet Filesender (encrypted) and will register data in Limesurvey by using the BELpREG study code of patients. Datasets 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 will be stored on the password protected cloud service of KU Leuven Business One Drive; computers will be used which can only be accessed by using a login and password. A clean desk policy will be followed: no papers potentially containing personal data will be left unattended and visible. Screens of laptops will be locked when left unattended. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The cost for the virtual REDCap server, including the server storage (100GB), is €287 + €50,37 / year. This cost is covered by the available project funding of the BELpREG project. KU Leuven Business One Drive cloud services are free for KU Leuven employees. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project 4.

What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The price of the K-drive (100Gb) is €11,38 per year, but the Group Biomedical Sciences sponsors 50% of this cost price.
