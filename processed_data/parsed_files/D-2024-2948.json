However, stressful triggers like toxic protein aggregates or traumatic brain\ninjury can cause its detachment and invasion of synaptic terminals, leading to synapse loss. Interestingly, cold stress-induced torpor in hamsters also\nresults in Tau detachment and massive synapse loss, indicating that Tau may be responsible for executing stress signals that cause synapses to retract.\nHowever, unlike in neurodegeneration, hibernating hamsters do not convert into overt neurodegeneration and they manage to quickly regenerate\nsynapses upon emergence from hibernation. This proposal aims to identify the molecular determinants of this remarkable form of synaptic plasticity at\nsingle-cell resolution and identify factors that cause hibernation-induced synapse remodeling in hamster brains using new technology. We will then test\nthe hypothesis that synaptic regeneration pathways that hamsters use, are able to counteract synapse loss in models of Tau-induced disease. Preliminary\ndata already identified several synaptic proteins which are deregulated in hibernation and implicated in neurodegenerative disease, including Rab3a\nthat we will study here. This research will not only uncover the role of Tau- intersecting pathways in a remarkable form of synaptic plasticity, but also\nhow this can be used to counteract synapse loss in Tau-induced disease.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n26-06-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

However, stressful triggers like toxic protein aggregates or traumatic brain injury can cause its detachment and invasion of synaptic terminals, leading to synapse loss. Interestingly, cold stress-induced torpor in hamsters also results in Tau detachment and massive synapse loss, indicating that Tau may be responsible for executing stress signals that cause synapses to retract. However, unlike in neurodegeneration, hibernating hamsters do not convert into overt neurodegeneration and they manage to quickly regenerate synapses upon emergence from hibernation. This proposal aims to identify the molecular determinants of this remarkable form of synaptic plasticity at single-cell resolution and identify factors that cause hibernation-induced synapse remodeling in hamster brains using new technology. We will then test the hypothesis that synaptic regeneration pathways that hamsters use, are able to counteract synapse loss in models of Tau-induced disease. Preliminary data already identified several synaptic proteins which are deregulated in hibernation and implicated in neurodegenerative disease, including Rab3a that we will study here. This research will not only uncover the role of Tau- intersecting pathways in a remarkable form of synaptic plasticity, but also how this can be used to counteract synapse loss in Tau-induced disease.

Last modiﬁed 26 June 2024 7 of 11 Primary storage for active digital files active digital files will be on KU Leuven servers. KU Leuven offers fast (\"J-drive) and slower (\"L-drive\") storage that allows reading/writing/modification of non-confidential, confidential, and strictly confidential data. KU Leuven further offers the ManGO platform for storage and management of large volumes of active research data large volumes of active research data . This platform allows secure storage, manual and automated metadata coupling, data workflows, and file sharing. Data that is no longer active, can be archived archived on the KU Leuven K-drive, which allows reading of non-confidential, confidential, and strictly confidential data. Physical samples Physical samples Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory. Cell lines: Human cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid nitrogen storage and will be deposited in the UZ Leuven-KU Leuven Biobank. Animal cell lines will be stored in liquid nitrogen of the laboratory. Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacterial glycerol stock (-80°C). All published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request. Bacterial strains will be stored in a -80°C freezer. Fly line stocks are preserved as a minimum of two separate cultures, each maintained at 18°C on a 4-to-5-week generation cycle. Hamsters: Hamsters will be maintained in facilities of the Laboratory Animal Center of KU Leuven, which applies Standard Operation Procedures concerning housing, feeding, health monitoring to assure consistent care in accordance with European and national regulations and guidelines. All animals will be registered in the Leuven Animal Information System (LAIS) database, along with corresponding genotyping information, ethical approval documents and animal provider receipts. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? KU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme: - data stored on the “ L-drive L-drive ” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept. - data stored on the “ J-drive J-drive ” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept. - data stored in ManGO ManGO : Snapshots are made at regular intervals (hourly, daily and monthly) in case data needs to be recovered. The data itself is synchronized on two separate hardware storage systems, each 6 PB large, located at Leuven and at Heverlee (ICTS). The data is protected against calamities at either site by synchronizing it in real-time at hardware level. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project?
