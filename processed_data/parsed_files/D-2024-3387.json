The F WO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official  start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of t he project by the relevant expert panel.  Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.  \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. T his Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives o f all Flemish funders \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requ irements for data \nmanagement planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a stan dardized glossary  of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link.  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        2 \n 1.

In addition to \nrevolutionizing the treatment of life -threatening bacterial infections, these compounds have facilitated a \nmyriad of medical procedures including cancer  therapies and organ transplants. Recently, however, \nhealthcare systems worldwide are threatened by the accelerated emergence and spread of mechanisms \nconferring resistance towards all antibiotics in clinical use. Furthermore, the golden era of antibiotic \ndiscovery is long gone, and new antibiotics reach the market at an alarmingly slow pace. If no action is \ntaken, a post -antibiotic crisis is eminent in which common infections kill and routine surgical procedures \ncome with high risks. With antibiotic resist ance already claiming 1.3 million lives annually and projections \nindicating a potential rise to 10 million by 2050, there is an urgent need to find new antimicrobial \ncompounds. We here propose to identify hitherto unknown genetic determinants that are esse ntial for \nsurvival of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in lab conditions as well as during infection of \na host. The proposed platform uniquely integrates advanced experimental approaches including genome -\nscale CRISPR editing with high -throughput screening in clinically relevant conditions. Pinpointing the \ncrucial elements of survival determinants will in the future allow for the design of new antimicrobials with \nunprecedented mechanisms of action.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        4 \n 2.

Physical data are all materials tha t need proper management because they are \nvaluable, diffic ult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated.  Materials that are  not considered data  in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and \npresentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentatio n/metadata.   \nRDM Guidance on data   \n \nIf you reuse existing data, please specify the \nsource, preferably by using a persistent \nidentifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per \ndataset or data type.   \n Scripts:  We have in-house sgRNA design and RNAseq data analysis scripts that have not been published \nyet. For the analysis of MAGESTIC screening data, we will use and modify in-house scripts for deep \nmutational scanning of essential bacterial proteins ( Nat Commun (2023) 14: 241. ). \n \nProtocols:  We have in-house optimized protocols for the generation of CRISPRi and MAGESTIC libraries \nfrom oligo arrays, but these are not published yet.  Which protocols will be used in T1.5 (Larger genetic \nnetworks and underlying molecular mechanisms) depends largely on the output generated in T1.2, T1.3 \nand T1.4. Nonetheless, we can rely on  in-house protocols for some assays  (e.g. Front Microbiol (2017) 8: \n1193. ). \n \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        10 \n The validity  of our CRISPRi screenings wil l be verified based on transposon -based records of the essential \nP. aeruginosa genome ( Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A (2019) 116: 10072 -80.).  \nAre there any ethical issues concerning the \ncreation and/or use of the data  \n(e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual \nuse)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data \ntypes when appropriate  and provide the \nrelevant ethical approval number . ☐ Yes, human subject data ; provide SMEC or EC a pproval  number:    \n☒ Yes, animal data ; provide ECD reference number:    \n☐ Yes, dual use; provide approva l number :   \n☐ No \nAdditional information : \nWP1 and WP2 both comprise mice experiments . I already obtained the FELASA B certificate required for \nthese experiments, but approval by the institutional Ethical Committee for Animal Testing will only be \nsought when the above -mentioned CRISPR i and CRISPR  editing approaches are optimized  for in vivo \ntesting . Evidently, we will not proceed with the mice experiments until we receive approval from the \nEthical Committee.  There are no other ethical issues concerning the proposed work.  \nWill you process personal  data4? If so, please \nrefer to specific datasets or data types when \nappropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ \nLeuven privacy register number (G or S number).  ☐ Yes (provide PRET G -number or EC S -number below)  \n☒ No \nAdditional information:  \nThere are no privacy issues concerning the proposed work.  \nDoes your work have potential for commercial \nvalorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin -\noffs, commercial exploitation, …)?  \nIf so, please comment per dataset or data type \nwhere appropriate.  ☒ Yes \n☐ No \nIf yes , please comment :  \nPotential tech transfer will be discussed with the KU Leuven Research & Development  – Tech Transfer \nOffice.

All  relevant information on the specific libraries , mutants and other strains will be \nincluded in this database. This includes a library/ mutant/ strain  identifier, a thorough  description  of how \nthe libraries/mutants/strains were constructed and a link to whole genome sequence if applicable.  \n \nExperimental results: Data will be generated following standardized protocols which are stored in a \ncentral OneNote  notebook. Furthermore, an E-Notebook  (ELN)  will be used to register day -by-day \nactivities. Raw data, history and context of  experiments, protocols and analysed  data will be uploaded to \nthis E -Notebook and backed up in the cloud. After publication  or upon submission of manuscripts for \npublication, all datasets described in the publication will be deposited in dedicated  data repositories (see \nbelow).  \n \nScripts: All scripts for designing sgRNAs, analysis of RNAseq data , … will be properly annotated so that the \ncode is  understandable and can be used to re -generate the results. After publication or upon submission \nof manuscripts for  publication, all scripts will be uploaded in dedicated data  repositories (see below), \nincluding a readme file explaining  what  each script is exactly used for.  \nWill a metadata standard be used to make it \neasier to find and reuse the data ?  \n \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard \nwill be used.

The F WO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of t he project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. T his Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives o f all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requ irements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a stan dardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.

FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 3 Please provide a short project description Antibiotics arguably constitute the most important discovery in the history of medicine. In addition to revolutionizing the treatment of life -threatening bacterial infections, these compounds have facilitated a myriad of medical procedures including cancer therapies and organ transplants. Recently, however, healthcare systems worldwide are threatened by the accelerated emergence and spread of mechanisms conferring resistance towards all antibiotics in clinical use. Furthermore, the golden era of antibiotic discovery is long gone, and new antibiotics reach the market at an alarmingly slow pace. If no action is taken, a post -antibiotic crisis is eminent in which common infections kill and routine surgical procedures come with high risks. With antibiotic resist ance already claiming 1.3 million lives annually and projections indicating a potential rise to 10 million by 2050, there is an urgent need to find new antimicrobial compounds. We here propose to identify hitherto unknown genetic determinants that are esse ntial for survival of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in lab conditions as well as during infection of a host. The proposed platform uniquely integrates advanced experimental approaches including genome - scale CRISPR editing with high -throughput screening in clinically relevant conditions. Pinpointing the crucial elements of survival determinants will in the future allow for the design of new antimicrobials with unprecedented mechanisms of action.

It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all materials tha t need proper management because they are valuable, diffic ult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentatio n/metadata. RDM Guidance on data If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type. Scripts: We have in-house sgRNA design and RNAseq data analysis scripts that have not been published yet. For the analysis of MAGESTIC screening data, we will use and modify in-house scripts for deep mutational scanning of essential bacterial proteins ( Nat Commun (2023) 14: 241. ). Protocols: We have in-house optimized protocols for the generation of CRISPRi and MAGESTIC libraries from oligo arrays, but these are not published yet. Which protocols will be used in T1.5 (Larger genetic networks and underlying molecular mechanisms) depends largely on the output generated in T1.2, T1.3 and T1.4. Nonetheless, we can rely on in-house protocols for some assays (e.g. Front Microbiol (2017) 8: 1193. ). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10 The validity of our CRISPRi screenings wil l be verified based on transposon -based records of the essential P. aeruginosa genome ( Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A (2019) 116: 10072 -80.). Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number . ☐ Yes, human subject data ; provide SMEC or EC a pproval number: ☒ Yes, animal data ; provide ECD reference number: ☐ Yes, dual use; provide approva l number : ☐ No Additional information : WP1 and WP2 both comprise mice experiments . I already obtained the FELASA B certificate required for these experiments, but approval by the institutional Ethical Committee for Animal Testing will only be sought when the above -mentioned CRISPR i and CRISPR editing approaches are optimized for in vivo testing . Evidently, we will not proceed with the mice experiments until we receive approval from the Ethical Committee. There are no other ethical issues concerning the proposed work. Will you process personal data4? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number). ☐ Yes (provide PRET G -number or EC S -number below) ☒ No Additional information: There are no privacy issues concerning the proposed work. Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin - offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes , please comment : Potential tech transfer will be discussed with the KU Leuven Research & Development – Tech Transfer Office. The newly developed tools (high -quality CRISPRi libraries and deep mutational scanning in P. aeruginosa ) as well as lists of prioritized drug targets along with predictions on druggability of these targets have valorization potential. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Existing a greements between VIB and KU Leuven do not restrict publication of data. 4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11 Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use?

Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata . Biological material: Cryotubes and multi -well plates will be labelled with a reference number that links to an entry in our Microsoft Access Database which is hosted on a central server and accessible to all people involved in the project. All relevant information on the specific libraries , mutants and other strains will be included in this database. This includes a library/ mutant/ strain identifier, a thorough description of how the libraries/mutants/strains were constructed and a link to whole genome sequence if applicable. Experimental results: Data will be generated following standardized protocols which are stored in a central OneNote notebook. Furthermore, an E-Notebook (ELN) will be used to register day -by-day activities. Raw data, history and context of experiments, protocols and analysed data will be uploaded to this E -Notebook and backed up in the cloud. After publication or upon submission of manuscripts for publication, all datasets described in the publication will be deposited in dedicated data repositories (see below). Scripts: All scripts for designing sgRNAs, analysis of RNAseq data , … will be properly annotated so that the code is understandable and can be used to re -generate the results. After publication or upon submission of manuscripts for publication, all scripts will be uploaded in dedicated data repositories (see below), including a readme file explaining what each script is exactly used for. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : Various data types come with their own metadata containing technical information about settings, machine types, pixel density, resolution, channels... Examples of these include .fastq NGS files containing standard metadata on sequencing technique, or .nd2 following the FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12 metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . Nikon metadata standards. Throughout the project, these data files will be preserved with their original metadata. For .txt, .csv, .xlsx files containing tabular information, extra tabs or a head text section will be used to explain the data, the meaning of the columns etc. For others lacking a formally acknowledged metadata standard, Dublin Core Metadata will be used and a readme file will be saved in the same directory of the datafiles to explain all the various data files and give a broad overview of the analysis steps. Moreover, we will closely monitor MIBBI (Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations) for metadata standards that are more specific to our data. After publication or upon submission of manuscripts for publication, all datasets described in the publication will be deposited in data repositories (see below). Depending on the repository that is used, the metadata standard used by that specific repository will be filled in. If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: / 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored?

The Michiels lab has two drives on this internal KU Leuven server: the J -drive (shared drive) for daily use and the K -drive for long -term data storage. When necessary, data storage capacity can and will be increased. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . Guidance on security for research data Biological material: -80°C freezers are present in the Michiels lab. A back -up of selected strains will be stored in -80°C freezers present at a different physical location (Kevin Verstrepen lab, Heverlee). Unauthorized people do not have access to the strains on neither one of these locations. Experimental results: Data are stored on secure university servers with built -in back -up and versioning. These serves are secured by two factor authorization and passwords that are frequently changed. Data collected and stored in the ELN are also protected via two factor authorization. Password -protected hard drives equipped with anti -virus programs will be used as back -up. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Biological material: Costs associated with storing strains in -80°C freezers (at two physically different locations) are covered by general lab expenses. Experimental results: Cost s associated with large volume storage of experimental data are covered by general lab expenses . 5.
