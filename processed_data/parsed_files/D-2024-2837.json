Using spin to store information, spintronic-based memory technologies offer significant benefits such as non-volatility, low power\nconsumption, and high endurance.\nAlongside the advancements in MRAM technologies, racetrack memory (RTM), where the bit information is encoded in magnetic domains along a\ntrack, has also attracted significant attention. The capacity to host numerous domains within a track and to construct 3D architectures are key features\nto reach ultra-high-density RTM. However, the experimental demonstration of electrical control of RTM is still lacking. Challenges are related to the\nintegration of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) access units, which significantly influence the dynamics of domain nucleation and motion in\nferromagnetic nanotracks.\nThis PhD project aims to study the electrical control of RTM based on synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) as a nanotrack with MTJs as electrical\nread/write components. We will focus on the physical understanding of the domain nucleation and motion processes, as well as the potential to\nincrease the density of data storage by tuning the strength of the antiferromagnetic coupling. Therefore, this study will provide a physical\nunderstanding of domain dynamics in SAF materials at the nanoscale, which can pave the way toward a full electrical operation of RTM devices.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n11-03-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
