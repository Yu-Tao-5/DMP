Pyrethrum is a pesticide component derived from the chrysanthemum plant species. The yellow\nheart of the so-called ‘killer daisy’ contains a natural toxin called pyrethrin that is used to produce organic pesticides\nand insecticides. The premise of this project is that an ethnographic exploration of the pyrethrum revival programs in\nKenya, Rwanda and Tanzania can provide uncharted knowledge about adequate responses from the Global South to the\nglobal environmental crisis. This knowledge is crucial to develop a better understanding of African technical and social\ningenuity in the wake of the Anthropocene, an era defined as dominated by humanity’s destructive impact on the\nenvironment. The research question guiding this project is: what kind of ideologies, expertise and technologies emerge\nin the Global South as responses to global environmental challenges? The project is a unique collaboration between KU\nLeuven, UGent and Egerton University (Kenya). We will experiment with the method of eco-ethnography, by engaging\ncitizens (farmers and others) in the process of data-collection and in the continuous evaluation of the research process.\nThe project will result in two PhD dissertations, 8 scientific articles, one edited book volume, and various formal and\ninformal interactions with local and international stakeholders.\nLast modified: \n10-07-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data\neasier to find and reuse.\nYes\nKU Leuven's Research Data Repository (RDR) built on Dataverse - open source repository software built by Harvard University will be used to store data securely.\nResearchers at Ghent University and Egerton University will follow the metadata standard of RDR. \n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nData for each subproject will be stored on the personal OneDrive for Business of the researchers both at KU Leuven and Ghent University. Multifactor authentication will\nbe activated to ensure the safe storage of (strictly) confidential data. We will look into the possibility to set-up a guest account for the research collaborators at Egerton\nUniversity to allow them to store their data securely on a OneDrive server at either KU Leuven or Ghent University. If this is not possible, research collaborators at Egerton\nUniversity will comply with the data management regulations of their home institution. Proper data management will be overseen by a data manager Dr. Nick Rahier. \nHow will the data be backed up?\nData will be available on the RDR repository, all data will be backed up on a H-drive for a minimum period of 10 years afters the project start date.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nResearchers will have access to a personal and secure OneDrive with 2 TB (KU Leuven) or 3 TB (Ghent University) storage capacity. Each researcher will also have an\nexternal HD of 10 TB that is password protected to store larger video-files and/or non-textual data requiring larger storage capacity.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nMultifactor authentication will be activated to ensure the safe storage of (strictly) confidential data. Files will be uploaded to the secure server as 'read only' to avoid data\ntampering by third parties. External HDDs will be password protected. Data will be destroyed after 10 years (counting from the start of the project). \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nexternal HDD drives have been accounted for in the project budget under small equipment. \n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the\nproject? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues,\ninstitutional policies...).\nAll data-sets (anonymised if necessary) will be stored for a maximum period of 10 years on password protected external HDDs and/or S-compliant repositories at the host\ninstitutions (KU Leuven/Ghent). Physical data that cannot be digitalised will be kept in boxes with meta-data stored digitally for easy access to physical items. The data\nmanager, Dr. Nick Rahier, will oversee data storage in sofar this complies with the consent obtained by the research interlocutors in the various subprojects. Certain data\nmay be too sensitive for reuse in the future; or interlocutors have not given permission to store these data. For safety and ethical reasons, this data will be destroyed, and\nthus not be stored. \nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nData will be stored on password protected external HDDs and/or S-compliant repositories at the host institutions (KU Leuven/Ghent University). Data gathered by\ncollaborators at Egerton University will be stored following the regulations and facilities at Egerton University, Kenya.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nThere are additional expected costs for data preservation during the retention period. external HDD drives have been accounted for under small equipment in project\nbudget.\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type\nwhich data will be made available.\nYes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …)\n \n \nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.\nThe collected data (after anonymisation) will be accessible to all team members, unless the owner of the data explicitly states that the data cannot be shared. The data\nowner will have to provide a justification for this decision which will be added as meta-data to the specific restricted data-set. \nData can be shared to external scientific researchers upon request. Scientific researchers will have to motivate why they want access to the data. Requests should be\naddressed to the project's data manager: Dr. Nick Rahier. He will take up the request with the other team members and data owner. \nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nPlease explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nYes, Privacy aspects\nData-sets PD-Kenya, PD-Tanzania, PD-Kenya, PD-add are confidential data (e.g., name, sex, age, ethnicity, etc.) and will be restricted to use by the data owner only. \nSome of the data part of the other data-sets might include subjective views, political opinions, intimate descriptions of life experiences, etc. If proper anonymisation is\nimpossible and in case the data owner cannot guarantee complete source anonymity, the data will be restricted to use by the data owner only.   \nWhere will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.\nAll data-sets will be uploaded to the KU Leuven RDR repository or similar repositories at the partner universities (Ghent University and Egerton University). Physical data\nwill be stored by the data owner (or the data manager, Dr. Nick Rahier, if the data owner allows this) for max. 10 years past the project end date; \nWhen will the data be made available?\nThe empirical data collected that can be made publicly available will be shared on the project website and via the partner institutions' designated repositories. Regarding\ndata that cannot be published publicly, metadata will be made available containing info on how/where to request possible access by the end of the project (M48). For\npublished work (journal articles, conference proceedings, books, book chapters) the published and/or accepted version will be deposited in repositories at KU Leuven\n(Lirias), Ghent University (biblio) and Egerton (DSpace) and made available after an embargo period set by the publisher.

Grant number / URL: G044223N ID: 199925 Start date: 01-10-2023 End date: 30-09-2027 Project abstract: This project proposes an interdisciplinary, ethnographic study of organic pesticide production (pyrethrum) in Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania. Pyrethrum is a pesticide component derived from the chrysanthemum plant species. The yellow heart of the so-called ‘killer daisy’ contains a natural toxin called pyrethrin that is used to produce organic pesticides and insecticides. The premise of this project is that an ethnographic exploration of the pyrethrum revival programs in Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania can provide uncharted knowledge about adequate responses from the Global South to the global environmental crisis. This knowledge is crucial to develop a better understanding of African technical and social ingenuity in the wake of the Anthropocene, an era defined as dominated by humanity’s destructive impact on the environment. The research question guiding this project is: what kind of ideologies, expertise and technologies emerge in the Global South as responses to global environmental challenges? The project is a unique collaboration between KU Leuven, UGent and Egerton University (Kenya). We will experiment with the method of eco-ethnography, by engaging citizens (farmers and others) in the process of data-collection and in the continuous evaluation of the research process. The project will result in two PhD dissertations, 8 scientific articles, one edited book volume, and various formal and informal interactions with local and international stakeholders.

If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. No Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements/ research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. Yes Research is part of a collaboration between KU Leuven, Ghent University and Egerton University in Kenya. Collaboration agreements have been signed by all parties involved. These include sections on IPR of the creations resulting from the research. In particular, the following agreement on IPR has been included: The parties are jointly responsible for drawing up an inventory of the Project Results in the following categories: Exclusive Project Results, where the Party-owner is mentioned; Joint Project Results, where the co-owning Parties are mentioned and their respective contribution to the Joint Project Results. Each Party is entitled to the free, non-exclusive use of the Project Results of the other Parties to the extent necessary for its part in performing the Project. Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. No 2. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). All data will be tagged with metadata according to the FAIR principles: making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. Metadata will be data-driven (concepts and tags are defined based on the patterns detected within the data). A logbook containing metadata guidelines and methodological information per dataset will be part of the data management plan updated by M48 Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 10 July 2023 6 of 12 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. Yes KU Leuven's Research Data Repository (RDR) built on Dataverse - open source repository software built by Harvard University will be used to store data securely. Researchers at Ghent University and Egerton University will follow the metadata standard of RDR. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Data for each subproject will be stored on the personal OneDrive for Business of the researchers both at KU Leuven and Ghent University. Multifactor authentication will be activated to ensure the safe storage of (strictly) confidential data. We will look into the possibility to set-up a guest account for the research collaborators at Egerton University to allow them to store their data securely on a OneDrive server at either KU Leuven or Ghent University. If this is not possible, research collaborators at Egerton University will comply with the data management regulations of their home institution. Proper data management will be overseen by a data manager Dr. Nick Rahier. How will the data be backed up? Data will be available on the RDR repository, all data will be backed up on a H-drive for a minimum period of 10 years afters the project start date. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Researchers will have access to a personal and secure OneDrive with 2 TB (KU Leuven) or 3 TB (Ghent University) storage capacity. Each researcher will also have an external HD of 10 TB that is password protected to store larger video-files and/or non-textual data requiring larger storage capacity. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Multifactor authentication will be activated to ensure the safe storage of (strictly) confidential data. Files will be uploaded to the secure server as 'read only' to avoid data tampering by third parties. External HDDs will be password protected. Data will be destroyed after 10 years (counting from the start of the project). What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? external HDD drives have been accounted for in the project budget under small equipment. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). All data-sets (anonymised if necessary) will be stored for a maximum period of 10 years on password protected external HDDs and/or S-compliant repositories at the host institutions (KU Leuven/Ghent). Physical data that cannot be digitalised will be kept in boxes with meta-data stored digitally for easy access to physical items. The data manager, Dr. Nick Rahier, will oversee data storage in sofar this complies with the consent obtained by the research interlocutors in the various subprojects. Certain data may be too sensitive for reuse in the future; or interlocutors have not given permission to store these data. For safety and ethical reasons, this data will be destroyed, and thus not be stored. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Data will be stored on password protected external HDDs and/or S-compliant repositories at the host institutions (KU Leuven/Ghent University). Data gathered by collaborators at Egerton University will be stored following the regulations and facilities at Egerton University, Kenya. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? There are additional expected costs for data preservation during the retention period. external HDD drives have been accounted for under small equipment in project budget. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 10 July 2023 7 of 12 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. The collected data (after anonymisation) will be accessible to all team members, unless the owner of the data explicitly states that the data cannot be shared. The data owner will have to provide a justification for this decision which will be added as meta-data to the specific restricted data-set. Data can be shared to external scientific researchers upon request. Scientific researchers will have to motivate why they want access to the data. Requests should be addressed to the project's data manager: Dr. Nick Rahier. He will take up the request with the other team members and data owner. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes, Privacy aspects Data-sets PD-Kenya, PD-Tanzania, PD-Kenya, PD-add are confidential data (e.g., name, sex, age, ethnicity, etc.) and will be restricted to use by the data owner only. Some of the data part of the other data-sets might include subjective views, political opinions, intimate descriptions of life experiences, etc. If proper anonymisation is impossible and in case the data owner cannot guarantee complete source anonymity, the data will be restricted to use by the data owner only. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. All data-sets will be uploaded to the KU Leuven RDR repository or similar repositories at the partner universities (Ghent University and Egerton University). Physical data will be stored by the data owner (or the data manager, Dr. Nick Rahier, if the data owner allows this) for max. 10 years past the project end date; When will the data be made available? The empirical data collected that can be made publicly available will be shared on the project website and via the partner institutions' designated repositories. Regarding data that cannot be published publicly, metadata will be made available containing info on how/where to request possible access by the end of the project (M48). For published work (journal articles, conference proceedings, books, book chapters) the published and/or accepted version will be deposited in repositories at KU Leuven (Lirias), Ghent University (biblio) and Egerton (DSpace) and made available after an embargo period set by the publisher. If allowed, the accepted version of published work will be made available publicly. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. The empirical data collected that can be made publicly available (certain audio transcripts, video material, photos, etc.) will be licensed under the Creative Commons license (for visual material) or Open Data commons license (for textual data) Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. Yes A DOI will be available through RDR at KU Leuven, but is not yet available. For data stored in other repositories, DOIs will be added if repository allows. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? RDR is free for KU Leuven personnel, hence, no costs are expected for data sharing. If partner institutions would encounter costs to deposit and share data, we will look into the option to centralise all data-sets at KU Leuven, using RDR. 6.
