Air traffic is immobilized: do airlines companies have to reimburse all\ntravelers? An education centre cancels all further training courses: should the centre fully\nreimburse the advance payment it has received? \nA contract essentially is an allocation of risks.\nDeparting from their freedom of contract, contracting parties can predict the future and allocate\nassociated risks accordingly. It is, however, impossible for \nparties to (fully) anticipate certain\nevents. Especially systemic crises qualify as reasonably unforeseen events. They not only disturb\nthe contractual balance, but also and \nthe stability of the economic system. Different examples\npop up: the recent corona pandemic, the financial crisis of 2008 or the First World War. \nIn times\nof crisis, default contract law rules and general principles (hardship, force majeure, good faith, ...)\ntry to re-allocate the risks. Nevertheless and unlike other legal systems, Belgian rules on risk\nallocation are \ntoo rigid and principally attribute the risk to one party. This feels unjust and there\nis an evolution in case-law and legislation to circumvent the rigid approach by balancing the\ninterests of debtor and creditor. This balanced approach is pivotal, yet does not solve the\nproblem in itself: in the absence of a clear model of risk allocation (with operational criteria),\ncourt decisions continue to diverge and the impact of ad hoc regulation on contract law remains\nunclear. After classification and evaluation of the current contract law rules of risk allocation, this\nresearch aims to develop a new model of risk allocation that can be applied to reasonably\nunforeseen systemic crises in order and ensures both legal certainty and flexibility.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
