However, such measures are likely to be opposed if\nthey do not reflect public attitudes. To better understand attitudes towards climate change\nmitigation policies (CMP), and in particular what influences support of them, scholars have\nidentified various factors. Surprisingly, little research has paid attention to social justice\nconsiderations as an influential factor. This is astonishing given that several scholars suggest\nthat CMP are likely to affect poor individuals disproportionately. The proposed research seeks to\nfill this gap by a novel survey investigating how support for various CMP depends on social\njustice considerations. Additionally, governments will want to counteract the socially adverse\nside-effects of CMP, which might give rise to new fairness discussions. Existing research on\nsuch â€œecosocial policiesâ€\u0000 is limited to theory and studies stressing need for these policies.\nHowever, it is unclear which of these policies are particularly popular and how social justice\nconsideration and other factors influence their public acceptance. Therefore, another aim of the\nproject is to explore attitudes towards eco-social policies, how individuals rank social welfare\nand the mitigation of climate change, and how this varies across national contexts. The research\nwill address these questions by collecting and evaluating secondary literature and by online\nsurvey data.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
