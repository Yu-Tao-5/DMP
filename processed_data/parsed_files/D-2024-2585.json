During my PhD and junior postdoctoral\nresearch, I have demonstrated that these satisfy some long-standing VBM demands: they have low sensitivity to temperature, high sensitivity to small-\nscale local damage and they can be obtained in a dense grid with high accuracy and precision. However, there are still significant fundamental\nchallenges that need to be solved before modal strain VBM can break through. First, an in-depth investigation of the influence of different types of\ndamage on a multitude of monitored quantities including modal strains is needed, so that the appropriate features for damage identification and\ncondition monitoring can be defined. Second, the combined processing of modal strains with other damage-sensitive features remains largely\nunexplored. Data fusion, based on Machine Learning (ML) can lead to new features that are highly sensitive to damage. Third, optimal sensor\nplacement (OSP) for modal strain monitoring and combined features monitoring of bridges is an open problem. Finally, combination of\nexperimental data and numerical models for damage assessment is gaining attention in the past years but is currently facing limits due to scarcity of\nexperimental data and modelling issues. This project proposal aims to address these challenges and develop a robust VBM methodology for bridges.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n12-01-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Yes Access to KU Leuven OneDrive, Teams-site, I: and J: shared drives is guaranteed during the project. Several HDDs are also available. The amount of data that will be generated (expected to be less than <5TB) means that there is an abudancy of available storage. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? External HDD drives will be stored on secure places (closets, drawers) that can be locked. For online data, KU Leuven authentication is in place for KU Leuven OneDrive, Teams-site and backup I: as well as shared J: drives. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Costs are related to external HDD drives as the available free space provided from KU Leuven on OneDrive and Teams-site is sufficient. HDD cost is about 100 euros per disk and no more than 2 disks will be required. Cost will be covered by my FWO bench fee. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project?

In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). institutional policies...). All data can be preserved after the end of the project and for period of at least 10 years both online (e.g., KU Leuven One Drive) as well as on HDDs. Prof. Edwin Reynders of KU Leuven will have access to all generated data. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Data will be archived on KU Leuven One Drive and Teams-site as well as on external HDDs as backup.
