USE OF PLANTS IN CONTEMPORARY ART TO\nRECLAIM HISTORIES OF THE WEAK.\nAffiliation\nKU Leuven\n2. Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nReuse existing data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nI will use existing documentation of the artistic projects, but it may happen that I will also create\nsome images myself. I already did some video-interviews with the artists and I am going to\nproduce more of them (either live or via zoom or other online softwares). Another type of data\nthat I will gather is textual data - my notes on existing literature, general notes and transcript of\nthe interviews. I may also create new translations of existing texts. \nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 5\n \nType of data\nFormat \n Volume\nHow created? \nDigital photos -\ndocumentation of\nthe artistic\nprojects, historical\nimages and\nphotographs etc.\njpg, tiff\n<500MB\nsecondary data\navailable online or\ndocumentation\ncreated by me,\norganized in Tropy\nnotes on existing\nliterature - textual,\ndigital\ndocs\n<200MB\nCollected from\nbooks and other\nsecondary\nsources, created in\nWord, attached to\noriginal texts in\nZotero\nnotes taken during\nthe research -\ntextual, digital\ndocs\n<200MB\ncreated in Word\ninterviews with the\nartists -\nmultimedia\nwav., mp4, mov\n<2GB\nrecorded live as an\naudio or video file\ninterviews with the\nartists -  textual,\ndigital\ndocs\n<300 GB\ntranscripts of the\ninterviews,\ncreated in Word\ntexts for the\nproject’s website\nand Instagram\naccount\ndocs\n<100MB\ncreated in Word\nimages for the\nproject’s website\nand Instagram\naccount –\nmultimedia, digital\njpg\n<500MB\nsecondary data\navailable online or\ndocumentation\ncreated by me,\nedited or cropped\nin Adobe Bridge to\nrequired format\n \n \nTextual data will be collected in .doc or .xsl formats, depending on the kind of data. Photographs\nwill be stored both in high resolution in .tif format (if available) or/and in low resolution in .jpg\nformat. Multimedia material will require the most storage space. All data will be stored on\nOneDrive cloud service, provided by KU Leuven. This will guarantee backup and access.\nI will use the existing documentation of visual artistic projects. In case I would like to use any of\nthese images on the project’s website or Instagram account, I will first make sure to obtain\nartist’s permission.\nNaming for collected secondary data will be:\n author’ssurname-name_title_year\n3. Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nYes\nPrivacy Registry Reference: \nG-2021-4570\nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used: \nYes, the opinions of interviewed artists will appear with their name and surname, their artistic\nnickname or the name of the collective. I have already obtained the GDPR assessment and\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 5\nethical review of my project - from a GDPR perspective, there is \nno objection\n to starting the\nprocessing operations. \n \nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nYes\nContemporary artistic projects are often related to the author's private political opinions or\nphilosophical beliefs, therefore I take into account that the special data may appear, but I am not\ngoing to ask about that specifically. The answers are only valuable for my research when they\ncan be attributed to the particular artist in reference to his or her projects, for that reason I have\nto be able to connect various categories of personal data. \nSMEC has decided that my application meets the standards for academic research. It has\ntherefore received a favourable opinion. This approval is valid for 4 years. SMEC therefore\nconsiders the application as completed.\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nI will provide specific information through the file and folder naming (date, name of the author,\ntitle etc.). For data collected from external sources, I will save the documents of the sources in\npdf when present in the electronic version, or photograph the sources. I will also create a\nREADME.txt to summarize the collected contents and their organization in a folder structure. The\nREADME.txt file contained in a local hard drive of my private computer, as well as on OneDrive,\nbased on the template README.txt provided by research support staff at KU Leuven, adapted to\nthe needs of my project.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nYes\nI will add metadata to references using Zotero (for textual sources) and Tropy (for images). I will\nsort each file based on the following categories: primary sources (archives, interviews, recorded\ndata, photographs, field notes), secondary sources (books, articles, images) and add metadata\nincluding name of the author(s), date, title, place as well as thematic tags allowing to connect the\nfile with one or more areas of my research.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nI will store all the data on OneDrive cloud service provided by KU Leuven, as well as on my\npersonal computer hard drive. I will also use an external hard drive for extra backup and long-\nterm preservation, which will be encrypted.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nAll the data will be backed up online: on cloud OneDrive (with the automatic update every day) as\nwell as on a physical external hard drive (every 2 months).\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 5\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nI will use Onedrive cloud service provided by the Faculty (standardly 2TB) - it is an automatically\nbacked up storage space and since I will not use any sensitive data, it it safe for me to use that\nservice.\n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nDuring the project data storage creates no additional costs, since the cloud service provided by\nKU Leuven is sufficient.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nThe data stored on my private computer are secured with the password to open the device - I am\nthe only one who has access to that computer. Regarding the cloud storage, following the\nsecurity protocols, I will change the password of the cloud service every three months. I will use\nencrypted archives for long-term preservation.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nCore data will be stored online in a dedicated academic data repository. Following the\npreservation procedures, I will also store the data on a backup hard drive that will stay at the\noffices of my research unit at KU Leuven, at the Lieven Gevaert Centre, for ten years after the\ncompletion of the PhD.\nThe core dataset (except from the final text of the dissertation) created throughout my PhD\nresearch will be a list of the artistic projects from all over the world which use plants. The file will\nbe created as an Excel spreadsheet and it will be compiled with the visual documentation.\nAdditional resource requiring the long-term preservation will be the interviews with the authors of\nselected works.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nAfter the research KU Leuven uses 'Archive storage' and requires storage for 10 years. \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nArchive storage can be purchased through the Faculty's ICT service for approximately 75euros\nfor 500GB per year - this cost will be included in my budget\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nYes. Specify:\nData relating to interviewees will require specific restrictions in the sharing phase. Only the\nversions authorized by the artist will be shared (as a transcription). The multimedia footage\ncreated by me during those interviews (video or/and audio) cannot be shared with other\nresearchers and the public unless I give the consent.\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nI will make available an Excel spreadsheet with the list of the artistic projects from all over the\nworld which use plants as well as the transcripts of authorized versions of the interviews with the\nselected artists. It will be shared in academic repositories such as Zenodo.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn an Open Access repository\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 5\nI am willing to share the collected data in academic repositories such as Zenodo. I will seek the\nadvice of research support staff/IT support staff/legal support staff towards the end of my\nresearch to find the best available solution. After completion of the PhD, I plan to share edited\nand selected data in publications (either a monograph or peer-reviewed articles). I am willing to\npublish the complete text in Gold OA. I have already searched for OA journals which do not\ncharge author fees in DOAJ and within visual arts field I have found various options, so I believe\nthat such a publication will be possible. If not, I will opt for a Green OA.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nThe above-mentioned dataset will be uploaded in Zenodo as an open access dataset under a CC-\nBY license. Therefore, it will be available to anyone for any purpose, provided that they give\nappropriate credit to the creators.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing?
