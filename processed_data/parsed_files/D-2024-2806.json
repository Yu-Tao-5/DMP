Especially industrial\nwastewaters, rich in, e.g., lipids and proteins, hold much potential but are underexploited in AGS applications due to their complex and variable\ncomposition. Hydrolysis is indeed most often required and rate limiting. Moreover, if the influent required hydrolysis capacity is not met by the AGS’\nhydrolysis capacity, then the granulation is impaired. With as first objective to a enable robust AGS reactor operation for industrial wastewaters, this\nproject will (i) develop an extensive set of monitoring tools, focusing on hydrolysis capacity, storage and structural polymers and other activity\nmeasurements, (ii) develop a synthetic granule community to enable clear conclusions when the impact of the influent complexity is studied and (iii)\ndevelop a control strategy to boost and tune the AGS’ hydrolysis capacity. In general, granulation is enabled by structural polymers (stEPS), induced\nby feast-famine conditions, but also the slow growing organisms that store internal polymers are said to contribute. Both the stEPS and the storage\npolymers have industrial value when recovered. The project, therefore, also investigates waste granule pretreatment techniques to maximize (storage)\npolymer recovery. \nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n30-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). README.txt files will accompany each data set to explain experimental procedures, data-generation, data-analysis. These files will have the following content: the experiment date, reference name, description, goal, used protocols, generated type(s) of data, comments about the data, general conclusions, remaining questions and thoughts/ideas for future experiments. The corresponding (raw) data will be available in the parent folder of this README directory, in the folder \"Data\", with all corresponding filenames and directories using the same reference name as described in the documentation. All relevant files will be named YYYYMMDD_shorthand_description.extension for easy lookup purposes. The referenced protocols (SOP) are also contained in a separate folder, and structured in .docx and .md formats. Shortcuts are included in the filesystem if needed. In terms of processing data, all manipulations will be done in Jupyter Notebooks, containing relevant documentation in Markdown format where needed. Documentation for the applied Python modules (e.g. Pandas) will not be included, as this is readily available in the module docs themselves.

No To our understanding, there is no formal metadata standard for our discipline. However, for image acquisition, the Bio-formats standard is applied by saving all raw confocal image data in the supported .oif format. This directory containing raw data is separated from the processed versions for transparency and reproducibility. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 30 April 2024 4 of 7 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? While a working copy of all relevant data to this project (data, manuscripts, scripts...) are kept on the researcher's laptop, both a local hard drive and remote (Onedrive and Bitbucket repository) services will contain the same information (automatic sync on Onedrive is used if network is available). Instrument data from the HPLC/GC/IC/TOC and Olympus microscope are stored on the machine itself for one month, and archived locally by our technical staff. Confocal images are stored on a network drive. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? All files relevant to this project (data, manuscripts, scripts...) will be backed up automatically on Onedrive as provided by KU Leuven (if network is available). In addition, a separate hard drive is used for the same purpose to provide a local backup as well. These files will be retracable for at least 8 weeks. Regular backups will also be made to the Onedrive of the PIs. Concerning code (mostly Jupyter notebooks), LaTeX, and text documents such as protocols, READMEs, sources and bibliography will be pushed to a remote (private) Bitbucket repository on the researcher's (KU Leuven email) account. Large files such as microscopic images and raw chromatographic data are omitted from this form of data storage to avoid bloating the Git repository. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes The available Onedrive storage space (both of the researcher and the PIs), together with the local drives provide over 2 TB of storage space. This suffices for this project. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?

What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The storage service (Onedrive) is provided by KU Leuven, and the associated costs are therefore indirectly covered by project overhead cost. 4.

If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. Since the research group will have access to the full data via Onedrive, interested third parties can obtain raw data upon request. Published data, however, will be available through a public repository (e.g. BioRxiv) or through the journal itself. When will the data be made available? When will the data be made available?
