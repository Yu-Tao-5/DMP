The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\n1.General Information\nName applicant Haowei Huang\nFWO Project Number & Title 1242922N - \"Z-scheme\" Photoelectrochemical Cell Converting CO2 and Sunlight into Fuels\nAffiliation ☒ KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent\n☐ Universiteit Hasselt  \n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel\n☐ Other: \n2.Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make  \nuse of existing data?  ☒ Generate new data\n☐ Reuse existing data\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 2Describe the origin, type and format of the data \n(per dataset) and its (estimated) volume\nIf you reuse existing data, specify the source of these \ndata. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from \ndata formats (the technical format).The primary data that will be generated consists of\n1) Analogue data:\n1.1) Samples (photocatalysts and photoelectrodes).\n1.2) Laboratory logbooks.  \n1.3) Researchers’ notebooks.\n2) Digital data (total estimated volume of tens to hundreds of GB/year):\n2.1) Experimental data (as directly measured): ASCII data files containing numerical data (measurement \noutput) and text metadata (describing experimental/instrumental parameters). Different formats \n(.txt, .dat and .cvs), depending on instrument used for the measurements.\n2.2) Processed and analyzed experimental data: text documents, spreadsheets and graphical \nrepresentation of data, used for (or resulting from) data analysis.\nThe kind of data that is generated is similar the for all work packages of the project.\n3.Ethical and legal issues\nWill you use personal data? If so, shortly describe  \nthe kind of personal data you will use AND add  \nthe  reference  to  your  file  in  your  host  \ninstitution's privacy register.\nIn case your host institution does not (yet) have a  \nprivacy register, a reference is not yet required of  \ncourse; please add the reference once the privacy  \nregister is in place in your host institution.☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes: \n-Privacy Registry Reference:\n-Short description of the kind of personal data that will be used:\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the \ncreation and/or use of the data (e.g. \nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)?

During each experiment, a detailed logbook will be used. These logbooks will contain the date, a brief \ndescription of the performed experiment, the parameters used for each measurement, as well as the \nnames of all the saved files.\nIn addition, data will be stored in a folder per experimental setup, the type of investigated system and \nthe corresponding date. In this way, by tracking the corresponding logbook notes, each file can be easily  \nfound on the local computers controlling the setup and on the server of the laboratory.\nThe analysis files will contain notes describing the analysis procedure and mention which original data \nfiles are included.

Physical samples will be stored for at least one year in the lab, rooms 00.170, Chem&Tech building, \nCelestijnenlaan 200F.
