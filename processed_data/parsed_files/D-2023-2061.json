In an MRI scan, the subject is placed in a static magnetic \nfield. To  obtain undistorted images, it is critically important that the applied magnetic field is as \nhomogeneous  as possible. However, the subject itself induces di stortions that are highly subject -\ndependent. For  instance, air -tissue boundaries cause local field inhomogeneities. These distortions \noften exceed the  capabilities of current field homogenization methods. Additionally, MRI data \nacquisition is signal -to-noise ratio (SNR) starved. One of the most efficient ways to improve the SNR is \nby making the  receive coils closely fit the subject to be imaged. However, the high cost of such coils \nprevents a  tailored design. Because of the resulting large gaps between the c urrently used standard \ncoils and  the subject, much of the signal is lost.  \nThis project proposes a strategy to address both issues in a subject -specific manner through the  \ncomputer -controlled fabrication of personalized passive shims that sculpt the magneti c field and  close-\nfitting receive coils at a cost two orders of magnitude lower compared to commercial solutions.  The \nefficient and low -cost digital workflow will cause a paradigm shift towards a subject - and application -\nspecific approach in both research and clinical work, enabling higher -quality data and  unlocking new \ntypes of studies.  \nInstitution: KU Leuven  \n \n1.

If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use (add the \nreference to your file in your host institution's privacy register - not relevant yet )  \n● No \n \nPrivacy Registry Reference: / \nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used: / \n \nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on \nhumans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to th e formal approval by the relevant \nethical review committee(s)  \n• Yes \n Experiments on non -human primates will be performed at the Laboratory of NEURO - AND \nPSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY, under the supervision of Prof. W. Vanduffel. Their ethical approval code is: \nP173 -2020.  \n \nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? \nWill IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions \nwill be asserted?  \n● Yes \nIf the proposed concept works,  a meeting will be planned with the KU Leuven tech transfer office to \ninvestigate patentability . The base technology of the approach is already protected by a granted patent . In \ncase a patent application will be filed directly resulting from this projec t, the related data will not be freely \nshared at least until the patent filing.  \n \nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If \nso, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?  \n● No \n \n  Commented [AV1]: Is dit al zo? In h et C3 project staat \nwel dat het al is ingediend, maar nog niet of het \naanvaard is.  \n4 4. DOCUMENTATION & METADATA  \nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this \nproject?  \nAn overview file that contains references to the raw data files will be kept. Regular reports based on the \ndata will be generat ed using Microsoft Word. PowerPoint files will be used for presentation at regular \ninternal meetings between the WP  leaders  and researchers involved in the project. In both the Word \nreports and Powerpoint presentations, the file names of the raw data files  will be included.  \n \nWill a metadata standard be used? If so,  describe in detail which standard will be used.  If no, state \nin detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse.  \n● No \n \nThe details of each experiment will be kept in an electronic lab notebook. In this notebook, also the \nnames of the raw and processed datafiles will be mentioned. Files will be named according to a pre -\nagreed convention. This working method obviates the nee d for a separate INFO.txt file in each directory \nyet ensures that the data can be understood by other team members and can be reused in the future.  \nFor published papers, the subset of the raw and processed data discussed in that manuscript will be \ncopied and organized according the paper structure. Likely, this is the data subset that will be most \nfrequently revisited and shared afterwards.  \n \n  \n5 5. DATA STORAGE & BACK UP DURING THE PROJECT  \nWhere will the data be stored?  \nThe data will be stored via a cloud storage solution that allows sharing with the WP  leaders  and \nresearchers involved in the project.  \n \nHow is backup  of the data provided?  \nThe data on the cloud storage server are automatically backed up. Unlimited versioning is included in the \nselected plan so that accidental erasing or modifying does not pose a risk.  \n \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how th is will \nbe taken care of.  \n● Yes \nThe total amount of data generated during the project should not exceed a few TB and is therefore \ncompatible with the selected cloud storage solution.  \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup  during the projec t? How will these costs \nbe covered?  \nThe costs for saving the data to the cloud storage server (including regular backup) should not exceed a \nfew hundred euros. These costs will be covered by the project.  \n \nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified \nby unauthorized persons?  \nThe data generated during the project will be systematically transferred to the cloud storage server. Only \nthe WP  leaders  and researchers involved in this project will have acce ss to the shared folders where the \ndata, reports and presentations will be stored.  \n \n  \n6 6. DATA PRESERVATION AFTER THE PROJECT  \nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case \nonly a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons  for this (legal or \ncontractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).  \nAll the generated data will be stored on the cloud storage server for a period of 5 years after the end of \nthe project.  \n \nWher e will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?  \nAll the generated data will be stored on the cloud storage server for a period of 5 years after the end of \nthe project.  \nBeyond 5 years after the end of the project, one of the following options w ill be picked (1) continuation of \nstoring the data on the cloud storage server or (2) transferring the data to the KU Leuven central servers \nfor archiving.  \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will  \nthe costs be covered?  \nThe annual cost for long -term storage of the data, either through a cloud storage service or the \nuniversity's central servers, is estimated at a few hundred euro. Since the budget of the current project \nwill no longer be available, creative solutions will have to be found.  \n \n  \n7 7. DATA SHARING AND REUSE  \nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in \nan agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?  \n● Yes. Specify:  \nThe data will re main accessible among the WP  leaders  and the researchers involved in the project. \nAccess to the data can be granted to other persons, upon request and agreement among the  leaders . A \npatent application can be a limiting factor in granting access to the data .  \n \nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?  \nIn case no restrictions apply, the written reports and Powerpoint presentations summarizing the results \nobtained can be made available. The (raw) data used in publications can be made avai lable on a \nrepository, if e.g. requested by the Editors or Publisher of a scientific journal.  \n \nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?  \n● Upon request by mail  or by dep ositing re search data in the KU Leuven RDR  \nThe data that will not have been uploaded in a resository such as 'Scientific data' \n(https://www.nature.com/sdata/) to accompany a publication can be requested via email.  \n \nWhen will the data be made available?  \n● Upon publication of the research results  \nDesc ription of the full scientific method and results will be made available with journal publications.  \n \nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?  \nUpon request, access to the samples and data can be granted, upon agreement of the project  leaders . \nCommercial reuse will not be allowed.  \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing?
