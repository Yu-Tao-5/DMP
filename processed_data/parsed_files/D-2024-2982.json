Achiral at rest, they\nacquire a helicity (chirality) in the direction of motion. Consequently, electrons are filtered according to their spin when crossing chiral materials. This\nnewly uncovered chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect is surprisingly large. Spin polarization up to 100% has been demonstrated paving the\nway to multiple applications in chemistry, such as improved control of enantioselective reactions and easier separation of enantiomers. Impacts are also\nexpected in physics (spintronics) and biology (molecular recognition of biomolecules). To date, the spin-filtering mechanism and molecular materials\nstructure-property relationships remain elusive. CISSCA aims at measuring CISS effect on well-defined self-assembled chiral monolayers on several\nspin-polarized interfaces to elucidate the role of molecular structure, orientation vs substrate, and order on the strength of spin-polarization, from the\nnano down to the single-molecule level. To face the challenge Y. Geerts (ULB) and S. De Feyter (KU Leuven) groups will team up. The former will\ndesign, synthesize, and supply tailored molecular systems to the latter that will measure spin-polarization by scanning tunneling microscopy and\nspectroscopy.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n09-02-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
