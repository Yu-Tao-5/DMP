During \nthis period, parents, peers, but also the media can act as important socialization agents who shape norms \nand values. In particular, digital environments offer unique opportunities to turn to media personae, so -\ncalled ‘super peers’, who can serve as role models and information sources regarding gender and sexual \nidentity in a way that is often not available in adolescents’ own social environment. Against this \nbackground, this PhD project makes three important contributions: First, drawing from a multidisciplinary \ntheoretical framework, it introduces the novel conce pt of digital super peers (DSPs), and investigates the \nrole of fictional (i.e., TV show characters) and non -fictional (i.e., social media influencers) DSPs in the \nexploration and achievement of adolescents’ gender and sexual identity. Second, it explores h ow the \nsocializing impact of DSPs ties in with adolescents’ intersecting identities, developmental phase, and social \ncontext. Third, it studies how gender non -conforming and non -heteronormative identities are portrayed \nwithin adolescents’ digital media rep ertoires and how they affect perceptions of their own and others’ \ngender and sexual identity. These contributions will be realized by using an innovative mixed -method \napproach combining interlinked longitudinal surveys and qualitative content analyses, in -depth interviews, \nand a multiple -exposure experiment.  \n \n  \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        3 \n 2.

If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. ☐ Yes ☒ No If no, pl ease specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: / Data will be uploaded in the data repos itory OSF, where additional metadata will be provided. For WP1, we will upload a fil e containing mo re detailed information on the set -up o f the qualitative interviews. Moreover, for the lon gitudinal survey, we will provide a pseudonymiz ed metadata file, in which , e.g., the codes linking participants across surveys have been deleted . For W P2, the codebook will be made available and will contain descriptions of all themes . That way, it can be reused in future studie s. For WP3, additional inf o will be provid ed on the concrete procedure that was used . Additionally, it will describe the stimulus material s and selection thereof. 4. Data Storage & Back -up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12 Where will the data be stored? ☒ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☒ Personal network drive (I -drive) ☐ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on -premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☐ Other: All collected data within the scope of this project will be stored on the secure KU Le uven drives (I - drive and J -drive) . So, access to th is data is personal and password -protected/accessible only through VPN. Furthermore, the identifying data will be stored in separate datasets than pseudonymize d data so tha t it cannot be linked. How will the data be backed up ? ☒ Standard back -up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back -ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If no, please specify: / How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Once processed, all data will be stored on KU Leuven’s shared network drive (i.e., J -drive) . This drive can only be accessed through the pas sword -protected intranet or VPN, and is only a ccess ible to KU Le uven employees who have been granted access . Additionally, data will be upload to the drive with read -only access, so that unauthorized individuals may not modify the data. Also, the identifying data will be stored in separate datasets than pseudonymize d data so tha t it cannot be linked. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? There are no additional costs expected. The cost to access the I - and J -drives have already been covered by the research group. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project?
