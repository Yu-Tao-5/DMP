These data are backed up automatically and their long-term availability is ensured by TM’s status as KU Leuven Core Facility. My personal notes and bibliographical references (.docx), as well as the .txt and .csv files, will be backed up in the Faculty’s OneDrive cloud service, which offers enough storage for my research purposes. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? The Faculty’s OneDrive cloud service includes automatic daily backups, so my data will be safeguarded in case of theft, accidental loss, or deletion. The same applies to information stored on the Trismegistos+ (TM) server. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes The storage offered by the Faculty’s OneDrive cloud service and Trismegistos+ is enough for my research purposes. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Scholars in my research unit and I will have access to the data. My data does not contain personal or sensitive information. Therefore, the KU Leuven multi-factor authentication procedure used for accessing laptops, databases, and OneDrive is sufficient. The database hosted on the Trismegistos+ server is equally protected by KU Leuven's two-factor authentication and will only be accessible to users of the platform, i.e. staff of my research unit and a number of collaborators. The databases are VPN and password protected, and a personal account needs to be set up in order to grant a collaborator access to the data. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The costs involved by the collaboration with Trismegistos+ (which also includes data storage and long-term preservation) are covered by my FWO bench-fee and are included in the project's budget. 4.
