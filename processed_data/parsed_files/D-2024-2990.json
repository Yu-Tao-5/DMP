The Institute of Astronomy of KU Leuven has an automatic periodic backup (daily and off-site) on the network server of raw and processed data according to KU Leuven and in-house security standards: all data are secured with access restrictions on file-system level. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Data storage needs are estimated at ~20TB,including backups. This storage is currently available in the in-house server and storage system of the host institute and thus comes at no additional cost. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). institutional policies...). Continuous data preservation (even beyond the 10-year requirement) is possible thanks to the well-developed in-house storage and backup system of the Institute of Astronomy and the continuous data preservation of the CDS. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? All data will be stored long-term on the backup system (onsite and offline) of the Institute of Astronomy and on the servers of the CDS. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The costs for back-up and storage are included in the general working budget of the Institute of Astronomy. 5. Data sharing and reuse 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?

In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. data type which data will be made available. Yes, in an Open Access repository All computational tools will be open-source on Github for the benefit of the scientific community at large, in particular for those astrophysical projects that rely on modern numerical modelling. Furthermore, all relevant tables, databases etc. given in the publications will be given in the open-acces publications and if applicable downloadable from the Strasbourg Astronomical Data Center (CDS). The CDS is a data center dedicated to the collection and worldwide distribution of astronomical data and related information (https://cds.unistra.fr/about/cds/). All journal publications will be open access via the ArXiv.org and Lirias servers. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.
