The F WO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official  start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO \nbut to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel.  Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.  \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation  Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives  of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions.  This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary  of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.  \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   2 \n 1.

However, this application results in a \ndecrease in the value of the secondary raw resource, which is considered downcycling. To address \nthis issue, innovative applications are needed to produce new building  elements with low \necological footprint using recycled CDW. This project aims to assess the feasibility of using fine \nrecycled aggregates (FRA) in 3D printing concrete (3DPC), which could improve the rheological \nproperties of the mixture and reduce the use  of polluting, expensive, and/or scarce materials like \ncement and admixtures. By replacing natural aggregates with FRA, the ecological footprint of \n3DPC can be reduced while improving its printability. This project will validate the use of several \ntypes of  FRA in 3DPC and offer requirements and maximum replacement rates for specific \napplication areas and exposure classes in the construction industry, ultimately contributing to a \nmore circular construction industry.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   4 \n 2.

    "clean_full_text": "FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 1 FWO DMP Template - Flemish Standard Data Management Plan Project supervisors (from application round 2018 onwards) and fellows (from application round 2020 onwards) will, upon being awarded their project or fellowship, be invited to develop their answers to the data management related questions into a DMP. The F WO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.

However, this application results in a decrease in the value of the secondary raw resource, which is considered downcycling. To address this issue, innovative applications are needed to produce new building elements with low ecological footprint using recycled CDW. This project aims to assess the feasibility of using fine recycled aggregates (FRA) in 3D printing concrete (3DPC), which could improve the rheological properties of the mixture and reduce the use of polluting, expensive, and/or scarce materials like cement and admixtures. By replacing natural aggregates with FRA, the ecological footprint of 3DPC can be reduced while improving its printability. This project will validate the use of several types of FRA in 3DPC and offer requirements and maximum replacement rates for specific application areas and exposure classes in the construction industry, ultimately contributing to a more circular construction industry.
