Yes How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? By controlling carefully who accesses the (mostly historical) data (not giving access to unauthorized individuals). We also train our collaborators (PhD students and student assistants) to handle the data carefully. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? There are no costs: the OneDrive space provided suffices. I pay for my secure Dropbox backup personally. Part of the data (OCR and lay-out models) are stored on the Transkribus servers, which I have already acquired for the greatest part. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project 4.

How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? There are probably no costs for data preservation, as it concerns relatively limited data sizes. In the improbable event we need funding for data preservation, we can apply for money with, e.g., the Latin Literature department or the Seminarium Philologiae Humanisticae. 5.
