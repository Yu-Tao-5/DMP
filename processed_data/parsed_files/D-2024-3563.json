The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning.

It not only tackles the  \nneoplastic cells (e.g. anti-CD20 in B-cell lymphoma), but also interferes with the interaction between tumor cells its  \nnon-neoplastic surrounding cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME). The characteristics of this interaction guides  \nclinicians in their choice for personalized immunotherapy (e.g. PDL1-PD1 blockade), but, firstly, there is a need for  \nfurther understanding this interaction in different cancer types, and this information is lacking in lymphoma. Secondly,  \nthere is a need for practical tools for the hematopathologist to characterize this complex interaction on the patient  \ntumor samples.  In the next decades histopathologic analysis of tumor biopsies will still be the cornerstone for  \ndiagnosis, but in daily practice pathologists rely on a sequential application of sets immunohistochemical (IHC)  \nstainings. This is a time-consuming procedure, only partially remunerated by the RIZIV/INAMI, and only providing  \ninformation on which cells are present, which proteins are expressed but not to which interactions actually matter.  \nWith  this  challenging  project  we  step  up  from  Classic  Histopathological  techniques  (morphology  and  \nimmunohistochemistry, still being the standard in most labs) towards Next-Generation Pathology, including multi-\nomics  technologies,  like  single  cell-RNA  seq,  spatial  transcriptomics  (GeoMx  from  Nanostring)  and  multiplex  \nimmunofluorescence (MILAN).\nWe want to further elaborate on our earlier findings of the influence of EBV on the TME in EBV+ lymphomas, as we  \nbelieve a detailed understanding of this TME interactions is an essential step towards precision immunotherapy.  \nThe main objectives of this study is to unravel a discernible pattern of immune responses in patients with EBV-driven  \nlymphomas, using novel in-depth analysis of the TME. \nUnderstanding the interactions between tumor cells and its surrounding non-neoplastic cells will allow us to pinpoint \ndistinctive prognostic markers tailored for individuals with IDD-LPDs and define new targets for immunotherapy .\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.
