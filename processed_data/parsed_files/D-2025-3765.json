We will deposit the data in these folders with a file naming strategy that includes a project-based unique identifier code, the name of the scienties, the date of the analysis/experiment, and a code for the instrument used for the measurement. For previously published NGS datasets, we will generate a shared folder in our KU Leuven OneDrive storage space, where we organize the URLs of the source data, the names, dates, authors of the associated manuscripts, the type of NGS datasets and the species of the samples used in the study. We will keep a record of experimental protocols, the digital map of the freezers where experimental materials are kept in numbered boxes, data files (raw and processed), analysis scripts (R and Python -as Jupyter Notebooks), observations during the experiments. NGS samples will be stored for up to 5 years after the end of the project.

Yes Next Generation Sequencing data is required to be deposited to public repositories such as GEO, SRA, ArrayExpress or ENA at the time of the publication. The data that has not yet been submitted to these databases will be standardized using the metadata schemes such as Dublin Core, DataCite or Genome Metadata. This standardization will include a title, the name and the affiliation of the creator, date and time references, the subject and a text describing the contents of the dataset and its analysis pipeline, the format of the file, the category of the data such as NGS datasets, images or audio/video files, an identifier and access rights. In any data deposition case, a readme.txt document will be added to the initial directory to include all of the above-mentioned information to allow easy sharing, reusing and interpretation of the data in future.

Researchers working on the project have the control over who can access the files in their personal or shared OneDrive folders. The VSC storage is reached by personal accounts in a space accessible to group members. The ICTS data center at KU Leuven ensures a mirror network storage as a back-up strategy and easy recovery of the data.

What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The current cost of J Drive is 45.08 Euros/100Gb/Year. OneDrive and Teams accounts are free of charge to KU Leuven personnel. VSC staging costs 130 Euros/TB/Year. The costs will be covered by part of the allocated project budget. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for 10 years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of Which data will be retained for 10 years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? the project?

Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain below) NGS data will be made publicly available upon the publication of the manuscripts. Unpublished NGS data will be made available upon request 5 years after the end of the project. Since the sample quality may drop in time, physical data including the NGS samples and cell pellets will be stored until 5 years after the end of the project. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Shared network drive (J-drive) Other (specify below) All published NGS datasets will be deposited in dedicated publicly available data repositories (i.e. GEO and EBI ArrayExpress). In addition, we will store these sequencing files in VSC archive. All digital data will be stored in our KU Leuven OneDrive folders and J-drive, while the experimental procedures and notes will also be kept in our electronic lab notebook, together with physical notebooks. K-drive will be used for long term storage of published datasets. Algorithms that deviate from the standard analysis pipelines and developed within our group will be stored on Github.

What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? For a total of ~8TB over 4 years, we anticipate a cost of around 2500 Euros. These costs will be covered by this grant and other grants. Data Sharing and Reuse Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?
