At  early -stage \ndisease survival of patients is more than 90%. However, once cancer cells spread to other organs and metastases \narise, this drops to less than 25%, resulting in over 685,000 deaths per  year. Thus, there is an urgent need to define \nnovel therapeutic strategies against metastatic breast  cancers.   \nWe have found that patients with metastatic breast cancer often have a genome amplification in their  tumor specific to \na cell surface protein called NMDA receptor . This receptor is activated by molecules  including one called aspartate. \nWe find that aspartate is elevated in organs of mice and patients with  breast cancer, increasing the growth of \nmetastases. Thus, we hypothesize that targeting the activation of the N MDA receptor by aspartate inhibits breast \ncancer metastases. We will 1. define  how aspartate activates the NMDA receptor in metastases; 2. identify how an \nactive NMDA receptor  promotes metastases; and 3. target the NMDA receptor to inhibit metastases growt h. We will \nexploit  biochemical assays, multi -omics analysis, bioinformatics and clinical approved drugs in breast cancer  cells, \nmice and patient samples.   \nIn summary, we will dissect the function of the NMDA receptor in metastases. We expect to contribute in the long-term \nto the use of NMDA receptor inhibitors against metastases in the clinic.  \n Last modified: 02-05 -2024  \n \n \n \nTARGETING CELL SURFACE RECEPTORS TO INHIBIT METASTATIC \nGROWTH  \nDPIA  \n \n \nDPIA \n \nHave you performed a DPIA for the personal data processing activities for this project?  \n \n● Yes \n  \n \nTARGETING CELL SURFACE RECEPTORS TO INHIBIT METASTATIC \nGROWTH  \nGDPR  \n \n \nGDPR  \n \nHave you registered personal data processing activities for this project?  \n \n● Not applicable as patients are deceased upon collection of tissue samples  \n   \nTARGETING CELL SURFACE RECEPTORS TO INHIBIT METASTATIC \nGROWTH  \nApplication DMP  \n \n \nQUESTIONNAIRE  \n \nDescribe the datatypes (surveys, sequences, manuscripts, objects … ) the research will collect and/or generate \nand /or (re)use.

DOC UMENTATION AND METADATA \n \nClearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep \ndata understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. \nwhere this information is recorded).  \n \nProtocols and details related to data collection and processing will be recorded in electronic lab books (Benchling) by the lead PhD scientist (Ms. Ginevra Doglioni) and lab technician (Ms. Ines Vermeire). Data folders containing raw and \nprocessed data will be hierarchically organized and labeled based on the source of the data, the type of experiment, \nthe date of data generation, and the different experimental conditions analyzed. Data analysis methods and particularities (including metadata) will be described in README.txt and Excel files included in these folders. All files will be stored in the KU Leuven Large Volume Storage space (L-Drive), with sharing possibilities via One Drive \n(managed by the KU Leuven IT department).   \n \n \nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where \nappropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where \nappropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.  \n \n● No \nText documents and Excel files stored within each experiment folder in the L-Drive will contain guidelines describing \ndata collection/analysis methods and all relevant metadata (including experimental conditions, sample keys, \ncomputational analysis pipelines and their parameters) to ensure the reusability of the data and the repr oducibility of \nany further data generation.  \n  \n \n3. DATA STORAGE & BACK- UP DURING THE RESEARCH PROJECT  \n \nWhere will the data be stored?  \n \nUpon data collection/preprocessing, temporary copies of the data will primarily be stored in the KU Leuven- managed \npersonal OneDrive account of the lead PhD scientist (Ms. Ginevra Doglioni) and lab technician (Ms. Ines Vermeire). A \ncopy of the data will be immediately uploaded to the KU Leuven Large Volume Storage space (L-Drive) for long -term \npreservation and backup.  \n \n \nHow w ill the data be backed up?  \n \nData stored on the KU Leuven L-Drive is managed, maintained, and backed up by KU Leuven IT services.  \n \n \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.  \nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.  \n \n● Yes \nThe KU Leuven L-drive has sufficient storage capacity for the outlined project. We estimate that 1-2TB of data storage \nspace will be sufficient for long -term stor age of all data generated as part of this project.  \n \n \nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?  \n \nData stored intermediately on personal KU Leuven OneDrive accounts that are protected via password access set up \nby KU Leuven IT. Off -site access to L- drive data is available by KU Leuven data access points and is password \nprotected. Access to modify these files are limited to lab members with access to the Fendt Lab L-Drive folders.  \n \n \nWhat are  the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs \nbe covered?  \n \nThe annual cost of KU Leuven L-Drive storage is 569.2 euro/5TB/year. This cost and capacity include the performance \nof mirror copies of the store d data, for safety backup purposes. We expect that 5TB will be more than sufficient to store \nall data generated as part of the project. These costs will be covered by the budget of the project lead (Prof. Sarah-\nMaria Fendt).  \n \n  \n4. DATA PRESERVATION AFTER T HE END OF THE RESEARCH PROJECT  \n \nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are \napplicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons f or \nthis (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).  \n \nAll raw data will be retained for 5 years on the KU Leuven L/K -Drive. Initially, all data will be saved on the L-drive. Upon \npublication, all published dat a will be further organized and catalogued by figure for future reference to the raw datasets \nused for each figure and archived on the KU Leuven K -drive archive storage.  \n \n \nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)?  \n \nAll raw d ata will be stored on the KU Leuven L-Drive until publication, upon which the data will be transferred to the KU \nLeuven K -drive Archive storage.  \n \n What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs \nbe covered?  \n \nThe annual cost of L-Drive storage is 569.2 € per 5TB of storage space per year. We expect that 5 TB will be more \nthan sufficient for long-term storage of all data generated as part of the project. Upon publication, the data will be \nreorganized by figure and stored on the KU Leuven Archive K -drive. The annual cost of the K -drive is around 60€ per \n1TB. We believe 1-2TB should be sufficient to for the archiving of all data related to the project. These  costs will be \ncovered by the budget of the p roject lead (Prof. Sarah -Maria Fendt).  \n   \n5. DATA SHARING AND REUSE  \n \nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  In the comment section \nplease explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available.  \n \n● Yes, in an Open Access repository  \n● Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …)  \n● Other, please specify:  \nDatasets will be made publicly available, if possible, through repositories to support FAIR data shar ing. \nMouse sequencing and proteomics data will be made available on the GEO and PreoteomeXchange websites, \nrespectively. All patient data will be made available in repositories with appropriate access control (e.g. images in \nOMERO) upon de-identification of the personal data. Access to these data will be made available to any individuals \nmaking a specific request and this request will be handled by the institutional data access committee (DAC) in consultation with UZ/KU Leuven and the project lead, Prof. Sarah -Maria Fendt. The remaining data can be approved \nfor reuse upon request and will be assessed for approval on a case- by-case basis by the project lead (Prof. Sarah-\nMaria Fendt).  \n  \nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the dat a and under what conditions.  \n \nPatient data will be made available in restricted access repositories. Requests for access to the patient data will be assessed on a case-by -case basis by the Data Access Committee, KU/UZ Leuven and the project lead (Prof. Sar ah-\nMaria Fendt).  \n  Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where \nappropriate.  \n \n● Yes, Intellectual Property Rights  \n● Yes, Ethical aspects  \nIntellectual Property arising from this work is managed as per the framework agreement between the VIB (VIB Tech \nTransfer) and the KU Leuven, the two participating institutes in this study.  \nPatient data will be made available in restricted access repositories.

If already available, you have the option \nto provide it in the comment section.  \n \n● Yes \nAll data that will be deposited in open and restricted access will receive a persistent identifier (e.g, GEO data will receive \na GSE accession number, EGA data will receive a EGA accession number,...). Moreover, the manuscript will receive a DOI number upon publication in a peer -reviewed academic journal.  \n \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing ? How will these costs be covered?  \n Costs for data sharing will be discussed with collaborators on a case-by -case basis. To minimize data management \ncosts, free -to-use data repositories will be used when possible. Data management will be covered by own funding.  \n \n \n \n6.

We will 1. define how aspartate activates the NMDA receptor in metastases; 2. identify how an active NMDA receptor promotes metastases; and 3. target the NMDA receptor to inhibit metastases growt h. We will exploit biochemical assays, multi -omics analysis, bioinformatics and clinical approved drugs in breast cancer cells, mice and patient samples. In summary, we will dissect the function of the NMDA receptor in metastases. We expect to contribute in the long-term to the use of NMDA receptor inhibitors against metastases in the clinic.

DOC UMENTATION AND METADATA Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). Protocols and details related to data collection and processing will be recorded in electronic lab books (Benchling) by the lead PhD scientist (Ms. Ginevra Doglioni) and lab technician (Ms. Ines Vermeire). Data folders containing raw and processed data will be hierarchically organized and labeled based on the source of the data, the type of experiment, the date of data generation, and the different experimental conditions analyzed. Data analysis methods and particularities (including metadata) will be described in README.txt and Excel files included in these folders. All files will be stored in the KU Leuven Large Volume Storage space (L-Drive), with sharing possibilities via One Drive (managed by the KU Leuven IT department). Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. ● No Text documents and Excel files stored within each experiment folder in the L-Drive will contain guidelines describing data collection/analysis methods and all relevant metadata (including experimental conditions, sample keys, computational analysis pipelines and their parameters) to ensure the reusability of the data and the repr oducibility of any further data generation. 3. DATA STORAGE & BACK- UP DURING THE RESEARCH PROJECT Where will the data be stored? Upon data collection/preprocessing, temporary copies of the data will primarily be stored in the KU Leuven- managed personal OneDrive account of the lead PhD scientist (Ms. Ginevra Doglioni) and lab technician (Ms. Ines Vermeire). A copy of the data will be immediately uploaded to the KU Leuven Large Volume Storage space (L-Drive) for long -term preservation and backup. How w ill the data be backed up? Data stored on the KU Leuven L-Drive is managed, maintained, and backed up by KU Leuven IT services. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ● Yes The KU Leuven L-drive has sufficient storage capacity for the outlined project. We estimate that 1-2TB of data storage space will be sufficient for long -term stor age of all data generated as part of this project. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Data stored intermediately on personal KU Leuven OneDrive accounts that are protected via password access set up by KU Leuven IT. Off -site access to L- drive data is available by KU Leuven data access points and is password protected. Access to modify these files are limited to lab members with access to the Fendt Lab L-Drive folders. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The annual cost of KU Leuven L-Drive storage is 569.2 euro/5TB/year. This cost and capacity include the performance of mirror copies of the store d data, for safety backup purposes. We expect that 5TB will be more than sufficient to store all data generated as part of the project. These costs will be covered by the budget of the project lead (Prof. Sarah- Maria Fendt). 4. DATA PRESERVATION AFTER T HE END OF THE RESEARCH PROJECT Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons f or this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). All raw data will be retained for 5 years on the KU Leuven L/K -Drive. Initially, all data will be saved on the L-drive. Upon publication, all published dat a will be further organized and catalogued by figure for future reference to the raw datasets used for each figure and archived on the KU Leuven K -drive archive storage. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? All raw d ata will be stored on the KU Leuven L-Drive until publication, upon which the data will be transferred to the KU Leuven K -drive Archive storage. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The annual cost of L-Drive storage is 569.2 € per 5TB of storage space per year. We expect that 5 TB will be more than sufficient for long-term storage of all data generated as part of the project. Upon publication, the data will be reorganized by figure and stored on the KU Leuven Archive K -drive. The annual cost of the K -drive is around 60€ per 1TB. We believe 1-2TB should be sufficient to for the archiving of all data related to the project. These costs will be covered by the budget of the p roject lead (Prof. Sarah -Maria Fendt). 5. DATA SHARING AND REUSE Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. ● Yes, in an Open Access repository ● Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ● Other, please specify: Datasets will be made publicly available, if possible, through repositories to support FAIR data shar ing. Mouse sequencing and proteomics data will be made available on the GEO and PreoteomeXchange websites, respectively. All patient data will be made available in repositories with appropriate access control (e.g. images in OMERO) upon de-identification of the personal data. Access to these data will be made available to any individuals making a specific request and this request will be handled by the institutional data access committee (DAC) in consultation with UZ/KU Leuven and the project lead, Prof. Sarah -Maria Fendt.
