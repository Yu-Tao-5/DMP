The FWO expec ts a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official  start date  of the project or fellowsh ip. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO \nbut to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the projec t; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel.  Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.  \n \n \n1.

The research set out in this proposal primarily aims to obtain mathematical decision -support models  \nand does not have a dedicated data  collection aspect : the proposed work mainly consists of modelling \nand algorithm design.  In this context, in line with  what is common in the field of operations research, \nartificial datasets of problem instances can be  generated .
