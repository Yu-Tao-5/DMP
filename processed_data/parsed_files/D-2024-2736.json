The FWO expects a completed DMP \nno later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-or -\ndination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Anthony Sezirahiga, https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4319-7873\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Peter Carmeliet, https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7961-1821 , supervisor\nProject number 1 & title 11Q0K24N, Immunosuppressive mystery genes in immunomodulatory endothelial cells as overlooked tar -\ngets for alternative immunotherapy for cancer\nFunder(s) GrantID 2FWO (11Q0K24N)\nAffiliation(s) KU Leuven \nROR identifier KU Leuven: 05f950310\nPlease provide a short project description Anti-cancer Immunotherapy (IT) has huge potential but faces challenges of insufficient efficacy and resist -\nance, in part due to the immunosuppressive (ImmuSup) nature of the endothelial cells (ECs) lining the tu -\nmor vasculature. I aim to tune these ECs from ImmuSup to immunostimulatory as potential alternative IT \n(alterIT). I fully realize that (too) many basic research results fail to translate into drugs/clinical treatments \ndue to selectivity and toxicity issues following suboptimal initial target selection and validation. Therefore, \nI will 1) use the in-house developed artificial intelligence (AI)-based scMysterYdentifier tool to predict truly  \nnovel ImmuSup genes in the ‘mystery genome’ (lacking functional annotation, 1/3 of the genome), a gold -\nmine for innovative target discovery; 2) Prioritize the predicted candidates using a text-mining-based ap -\nproach to interrogate their known features; 3) directly validate the prioritized ImmuSup mystery genes in \nvivo by generating EC-selective knockdown mice rapidly (days)/inexpensively using a new in-house de -\nveloped gene knockdown REVOLT technology; 4) perform elaborate mechanistic studies to delineate their \nmolecular mode-of-action. All approaches are operational.

Not only will this provide us fundamental knowledge to publish in a top journal, but it also provides the most promising mystery target with potential to be translated to clinical applications. Submission of patents will be evaluated in collaboration with VIB. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict ex - ploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please explain: Human tumor samples are provided by UZ Leuven to the host laboratory under an MTA. The MTA stipu - lates that provider and recipient agree to negotiate a joint ownership agreement which shall specify rights and obligations of each Party related to the use, exploitation, and protection of patentable or non- patentable joint results. Are there any other legal issues, such as intellec - tual property rights and ownership, to be man - aged related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please explain: Human tumor samples are provided by UZ Leuven to the host laboratory under an MTA.

RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .Generated sequencing data for this project will be uploaded to EGA and GEO in combination with related metadata (e.g. age, gender, case/control status, sequencing platform/library... etc.) to be accessible to the public upon submission. A physical sample inventory will be stored in freezers (plasmids, vectors, RNA and protein extracts) and liquid nitrogen tank (cells) and a file with sample details will be saved on the shared server. Flow cytometry and sorting: information on gating strategy for cell identification and sorting will be saved in electronic files with details on antibody concentrations and protocols for cell preparation and staining will be described in detail in lab books. Imaging (confocal and cytation5 imager): images and settings will be saved in electronic files. Details on staining techniques and antibody or dye concentrations and protocols for cell preparation will be de - scribed in detail in lab books. Datafiles and the imaging protocols will be stored on KULeuven servers. Excel documents will always be saved in the csv format, so that it can be read as American csv/tab- delim - ited text or European csv/tab-delimited text. For publication, the standards of the journal in which the data will be published, will be used. For all stored data, a readme-file is provided, which includes a short description of the filename, definitions of column headings and row labels, data processing steps, storage information and contact information.

WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? ☒ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back-ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) The data will be backed up in a double way. Automatic back-up (every 24 hours) of the network L-drive is controlled by the ICTS KU Leuven department. In addition, every researcher’s computer has installed the Druva Cloud Platform. Druva Cloud protects and manages data across all devices, and allows to perform the backup operations even every 5 minutes (managed individually - depends on the user). Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify con - cisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No KU Leuven provides sufficient storage and back-up capacity during and after the project. A dedicated folder will be made for the project on which the collaborators will work jointly and store data files. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unau - thorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data The network drive for the FWO project folder and the large volume storage folder are secured by the ICTS service of KU Leuven with a mirror copy. Only other lab members, will have access to the shared folder. Unauthorized persons do not have access to this system. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Yearly storage costs of 1TB data on large storage servers of the host lab are estimated at 130 €/year. Costs will be covered by internal lab fundings. 5.
