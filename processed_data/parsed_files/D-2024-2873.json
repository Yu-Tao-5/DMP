While the literature has developed basic techniques for mitigating each\none these challenges separately, an integrated technology that efficiently addresses both challenges simultaneously is lacking.\n \nThis project will introduce a new neural network architecture, including advanced training algorithms, that aims to mitigate aforementioned challenges\nsimultaneously. The first challenge will be overcome by appealing to data-sparse (memory-efficient) tensor decompositions applied in an innovative\nway so that both the linear maps applied by the neural network and the signals propagated through it stay in a data-sparse format. The second challenge\nwill be mitigated by fusing above tensor decomposition technology with the ability to stay invariant under desired (group) transformations of the\ninputs, while further improving the data sparseness of its linear maps.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n08-05-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

In addition, to this, when a paper is accepted for publication, all research items, excluding large data sets that can be regenerated from codes, will be archived in the PI's KU Leuven OneDrive. This system has its own backup mechanisms. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes The program codes will require less than a few megabytes. The simulation results we will generate, are not expected to exceed a few gigabytes, well within the capabilities of the standard computers we will use. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The research software code will be developed through GitLab, which requires authentication. Only the project's participants will be able to modify these items. Who modified what and how is precisely tracked by this version management system.
