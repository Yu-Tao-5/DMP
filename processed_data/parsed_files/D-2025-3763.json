The complete list of sub-projects\nis summarized as a final list (.doc file); the detailed protocols are also digitally archived on the lab’s \nDropbox or J-drive\n. In the\nnotes, clear links are provided to (1) digital data (pictures, excel files, movies, others), and where to find these (Dropbox, J-drive, L-\ndrive, etc); file names, types and dates have to be provided; and to (2) physical data (new cell lines, plasmids, gRNA, recombinant\nproteins, compounds) and where/how they are stored. Concerning the physical data, the dedicated lab lists/archives need to be\nupdated with the new tools and their storage information; for plasmids this involves registration of the unique identifier, all\nrelevant info on how the plasmid was made (cloning sites, primers, resistance markers), the accompanying DNA sequencing\ninformation, and its storage site.\nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to \nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to \nfind and reuse the data\nfind and reuse the data\n?  \n?  \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. \nIf not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. \nIf not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. \nNo\nNo real metadata standard will be used. Each researcher provides a clear overview (summary) of the data generated or\nprocessed, per subproject (see above). Lists of new tools will be digitally archived on the Dropbox, the J-drive and the L-drive;\nprocessed data will be provided as digital info on the J-drive,  and eventually on the K-drive (e.g. labmeetings, posters,\nintermediate reports, papers). On the K-drive, the data are structured/ordered per paper, and per researcher. The data of one\nresearcher are structured/ordered per sub-project, and subsequently, per date and per type (for raw data).\nData Storage & Back-up during the Research Project\nData Storage & Back-up during the Research Project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nWhere will the data be stored?\nOther (specify below)\nShared network drive (J-drive)\nLarge Volume Storage\nPaper lab notebooks are kept in locked cabinets in the labs of the PIs concerned. Digital data files are stored on local KU Leuven\nPCs or shared KU Leuven J-drive (connected to specific equipment: scanner, microscope, IncuCyte,…). Raw MS data are stored on\nstorage drives backed up by KU Leuven, as well as on the L-drive (for a limited time) . After that time period, data are kept on\nexternal SSDs (1 TB). Processed MS data are stored on KU Leuven local PCs and transferred to the SSDs.\nCrystallization images will be stored using dedicated 10Tb NAS storage. Raw and processed crystallography and cryo-EM data\nwill be stored at the KU Leuven using dedicated NAS storage (180Tb).\nRegarding the data pertaining to publications, it is our policy that the first author is responsible for storing ALL raw and processed\ndata of the paper concerned in a subfolder on the K-Archive drive (<100 GB). This measurement was taken, in part, to prevent that\nrelevant data get lost or can no longer be properly retrieved later on; in part, to prevent scientific integrity issues. Thus, the first\nauthor of the paper is responsible for making all the data concerning his/her paper fully available and tractable, by archiving them\non the K-drive. We also plan to upload manuscripts before publication to bioRxiv (\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/\n)\n whenever appropriate.\nIn addition, after publication, all proteomics data will be deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner\nrepository; all structural data to PDB.\nThe physical data for this project will be stored in approriate storage conditions, i.e. liquid nitrogen cell containers (Cryothek at\nBiomedical campus), -80°C or -20°C freezers, in a sufficient amount of aliquots (at least 5 per cell line, 2 per plasmid or gRNA, 10\nper compound). In part, and after publication, newly generated plasmids with accompanying descriptions and sequencing data,\nwill be submitted to Addgene; new cell lines may be submitted to Cell Bank.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nHow will the data be backed up?\nStandard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution\nPersonal back-ups I make (specify below)\nOther (specify below)\nBesides regularly provided automated backups by ICTS (of J-drive, L-drive, K-drive), the data stored on personal PCs and J-drive\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

MS data older than\nthree years and stored on SSDs will also be backed up by copying to another SSD. External SSD hard-disks (up to 1-2 TB storage\ncapacity) keep the storage costs feasible since cost of an external hard drive is cheaper than ICTS storage costs for such big data\nvolumes. Whenever a scientific collaborator leaves the lab, all his/her data will be stored on the K-drive in a dedicated subfolder\nunder his/her name.\nCrystallography and cryo-EM data will be backed up initially after collection (ESRF/Diamond) and also locally at the KU Leuven.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? \nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, explain how this will be taken care of. \nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, explain how this will be taken care of. \nYes\nK-drive: up to 100 GB per PI; J-drive: up to 1 TB per PI; L-drive: up to 10 TB per PI.

Last modiﬁed 03 April 2025 4 of 9 and referred to each other in the lab notebooks, and detailed protocols are provided (.doc files). The complete list of sub-projects is summarized as a final list (.doc file); the detailed protocols are also digitally archived on the lab’s Dropbox or J-drive . In the notes, clear links are provided to (1) digital data (pictures, excel files, movies, others), and where to find these (Dropbox, J-drive, L- drive, etc); file names, types and dates have to be provided; and to (2) physical data (new cell lines, plasmids, gRNA, recombinant proteins, compounds) and where/how they are stored. Concerning the physical data, the dedicated lab lists/archives need to be updated with the new tools and their storage information; for plasmids this involves registration of the unique identifier, all relevant info on how the plasmid was made (cloning sites, primers, resistance markers), the accompanying DNA sequencing information, and its storage site.

Lists of new tools will be digitally archived on the Dropbox, the J-drive and the L-drive; processed data will be provided as digital info on the J-drive, and eventually on the K-drive (e.g. labmeetings, posters, intermediate reports, papers). On the K-drive, the data are structured/ordered per paper, and per researcher. The data of one researcher are structured/ordered per sub-project, and subsequently, per date and per type (for raw data). Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Other (specify below) Shared network drive (J-drive) Large Volume Storage Paper lab notebooks are kept in locked cabinets in the labs of the PIs concerned. Digital data files are stored on local KU Leuven PCs or shared KU Leuven J-drive (connected to specific equipment: scanner, microscope, IncuCyte,…). Raw MS data are stored on storage drives backed up by KU Leuven, as well as on the L-drive (for a limited time) . After that time period, data are kept on external SSDs (1 TB). Processed MS data are stored on KU Leuven local PCs and transferred to the SSDs. Crystallization images will be stored using dedicated 10Tb NAS storage. Raw and processed crystallography and cryo-EM data will be stored at the KU Leuven using dedicated NAS storage (180Tb). Regarding the data pertaining to publications, it is our policy that the first author is responsible for storing ALL raw and processed data of the paper concerned in a subfolder on the K-Archive drive (<100 GB). This measurement was taken, in part, to prevent that relevant data get lost or can no longer be properly retrieved later on; in part, to prevent scientific integrity issues. Thus, the first author of the paper is responsible for making all the data concerning his/her paper fully available and tractable, by archiving them on the K-drive. We also plan to upload manuscripts before publication to bioRxiv ( https://www.biorxiv.org/ ) whenever appropriate. In addition, after publication, all proteomics data will be deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository; all structural data to PDB. The physical data for this project will be stored in approriate storage conditions, i.e. liquid nitrogen cell containers (Cryothek at Biomedical campus), -80°C or -20°C freezers, in a sufficient amount of aliquots (at least 5 per cell line, 2 per plasmid or gRNA, 10 per compound). In part, and after publication, newly generated plasmids with accompanying descriptions and sequencing data, will be submitted to Addgene; new cell lines may be submitted to Cell Bank.

Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution Personal back-ups I make (specify below) Other (specify below) Besides regularly provided automated backups by ICTS (of J-drive, L-drive, K-drive), the data stored on personal PCs and J-drive Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 03 April 2025 5 of 9 will be weekly backed up on the personal KU Leuven I-drive, and the own Dropbox of the labs concerned (password-protected). Every two months, additional backups will be made on external hard disks, as an extra security measurement. MS data older than three years and stored on SSDs will also be backed up by copying to another SSD. External SSD hard-disks (up to 1-2 TB storage capacity) keep the storage costs feasible since cost of an external hard drive is cheaper than ICTS storage costs for such big data volumes. Whenever a scientific collaborator leaves the lab, all his/her data will be stored on the K-drive in a dedicated subfolder under his/her name. Crystallography and cryo-EM data will be backed up initially after collection (ESRF/Diamond) and also locally at the KU Leuven. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, explain how this will be taken care of. Yes K-drive: up to 100 GB per PI; J-drive: up to 1 TB per PI; L-drive: up to 10 TB per PI. Extensions of this volume can be asked for at ICTS at all times (for an additional cost).

What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? A small data management budget was applied for and granted in the project to manage extra costs; if this would appear not sufficient (e.g. in case of repair costs, or replacement of a physical storage device, or replacement of a PC is required), we will try to cover the costs from the consumables budget (or by matched funding) Archive drive costs: 20€/year/100 GB; daily back-ups.

CC-BY 4.0 (data) Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) We anticipate that the project may generate data and results with potential for intellectual property (IP) protection. Therefore, data will not be immediately released under an open license. Instead: Initially, access to specific datasets will be governed by a Data Transfer Agreement (DTA) to protect potential patent applications, confidentiality, or third-party rights. This allows us to manage the timing of data release and ensure compliance with institutional IP policies. If patentable inventions arise, we will follow standard procedures for protection prior to publication or public data release. Once protection is secured, data may be made available under CC-BY 4.0, unless further restrictions apply.
