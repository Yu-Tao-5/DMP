In contrast, the United \nStates have developed mechanisms to cope with asymmetric fluctuations within their national boundaries,  \nsuch as a high level of labor mobility, income diversification, fiscal transfers and integrated credit markets. \nThis project aims to answer to what extent these risk-sharing channels attenuate output and consumption \nvolatility. The first part sets up an empirical framework to identify the response of risk-sharing channels \nand economic aggregates such as GDP and consumption to local demand shocks in U.S. counties and \nEuropean regions. The second part then uses these identified responses to set up and calibrate a \nstructural model that features all four risk-sharing channels. The model is then used as a laboratory to \nanswer 'what if?' questions. For instance, by how much would business cycles in the euro area be less \npronounced if member countries had the same risk-sharing mechanisms as observed across U.S. states? \nWhat would happen to U.S. business cycles if we shut down one risk-sharing channel at a time?\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

GUIDANCE: The data description forms the basis of your entire DMP, so make sure it is detailed and complete. It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all materials that need proper management because they are valuable, difficult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentation/metadata. RDM Guidance on data If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type.

If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3.Documentation and Metadata 4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .Documentation and metadata will be added to all raw and processed datasets. A README file for each dataset will contain all the necessary information about the context of the data generation, the research project to which it belongs, and an interpretation of the data. A data dictionary/code book will be created as specified in the following section. The code used for data analysis and transformation will be documented in-file with detail, adding key comments at each particular step. Every code file will include a documentation section on top indicating: Goal: a short description of the code. Input: name, location, and format of all datasets/files needed to execute the code, clearly specifying their key identifiers. Transformations: short bullet points detailing the critical steps/transformations conducted in the code. Output: name, location, and format of all the datasets/files produced by the code. All the documentation (data, corresponding documents, methodologies) will be kept in the folder where the dataset is stored. The project will use the following folder structure: Archive: obsolete data/code which merits storage. Data: contains the data dictionary and an individual folder for each dataset. In each dataset folder, the structure will be: oCode: the code files used for data transformation, which follow standard naming conventions and indicate with numbers the order of execution. oDocs: relevant documentation/methodology. oInput: raw datasets. oOutput: processed datasets. oTmp: temporary data files generated by the code. oA README file and a main executable file for the code. Literature: relevant articles and bibliography related to the research. Notes: meeting notes relating to the project, with participants and dates clearly stated. Tasks: contains folders (with order of execution) indicating the transformations/analysis made in the project. In each task folder, the structure will be: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12oCode: the code files used for data transformation, which follow standard naming conventions and indicate with numbers the order of execution. oDocs: relevant documentation/methodology. oOutput: output generated by the task (figures, tables, derived datasets). oTmp: temporary data files generated by the code. oResults: a LaTex document indicating the results/analysis conducted in the particular task. oA main executable file for the code. All good practices in terms of file and variable naming will be followed. Every variable will be stored together with a descriptive label. The variable type (string, float, integer,…) will be clearly indicated and kept consistent across datasets. GitHub will be used as a task organization and versioning system. All standard naming conventions for variables, controlled vocabularies, and ontologies will be followed (main reference: Gentzkow, M., & Shapiro, J. M. (2014). Code and data for the social sciences: A practitioner’s guide. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago) Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: A data dictionary (.xslx) of the derived datasets used for analysis is to be kept and regularly updated. It contains all file names, variables, and descriptions. It clearly indicates the data keys (= variables defining dimensions of dataset/unique identifiers). If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 134.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored?

The GitHub accounts of the coauthors will be protected by multi-factor authentication. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?The OneDrive license we will use is free for KU Leuven staff members. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project?
