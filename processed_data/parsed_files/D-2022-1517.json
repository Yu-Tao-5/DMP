For research with \nvalorization potential, the host lab actively protects its IP by filling patent \napplications. Type of data with potential for tech transfer and valorization: yeast \nstrains isolated and generated during the timeframe of this project, sequencing \ninformation generated during the timeframe of this project and (analysis) data and \nmodels hereof derived. Valorization potential includes strain licensing, linking a \nspecific sequence variant to a phenotype.\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 8Do existing 3rdparty agreements\nrestrict dissemination orexploitation of\nthedata you(re)use?

Furthermore, in case of conda \nenvironments, an yml file is automatically generated which contains python packages\nand their versions. \nThese metadata files are placed in a folder which is indexed by the job-scheduler \n(SLURM), which is accompanied by the execution date. Therefore, the manner to \nsearch for metadata is slurmID-DD.MM.YYYY. This meta data is reachable by user at \nhttp://nerfcluster-fs:8080/singlejob , which is browsable from the nerf-network. \n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 105.Data storage & backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?  AT NERF, we have a data storage system with 327 TB capacity. The system has \nmultiple layers of protection to ensure long-term data retention. First, the system is \ndistributed into two datacenter sites which act as a mirror. Second, snapshots of the \ndata are taken regularly that allow recovering from accidental corruption or deletion \nof data. Third, the system screens the data on a regular basis to avoid data corruption\ndue to bit-rot. Lastly, the disks in each server are configured using RAIDZ2 (a type of \nZFS). \nNERF storage system for actual data, it is composed of two subsystems, one is a \ndedicated archive system and the another one is for Work In Progress (WIP). The \nformer is an object storage system, for which NERF has an active maintenance \ncontract with the provider (Cloudian), while the latter is a filesystem based on \nopenZFS. \nThe archive system serves to store data that needs to be kept long term (years) due \nto legal requirements or for a later analysis. This system is so-called “nerfhf01 ”. \nThe WIP system offers a high throughput which suits best for highly demanding daily \nIO operations. This system is so-called “nerffs13 ” \n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 11How will the data be backed up? The storage system at NERF has multiple layers of protection to ensure long-term \ndata retention.\nThe WIP server (nerffs13) has a \"twin\" server located in a different data center which \nacts as a mirror of the former. This provides data backup in case of full failure of the \nnerffs13, whether caused for severe hardware issues or in case the entire data center\nis compromised. Furthermore, snapshots of the data are taken regularly that allow \nrecovering from accidental corruption or deletion of data, which in combination with a\nRAIDZ2 (zfs-raid) configuration provides a strong data redundancy per server. Lastly, \nthe system screens the data on a regular basis to avoid data corruption due to bit-rot.\nThe archive system (nerfhf01) is a redundant system on itself, this is composed of \nseveral nodes distributed in multiple data centers. The nerfhf01 technology allows to \nhave one entire node down and data is not compromised.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & \nbackup capacity during the project? If \nyes, specify concisely. If no or \ninsufficient storage or backup \ncapacities are available, then explain \nhow this will be taken care of. \nWhat are the expected costs for data \nstorage and backup during the \nproject? How will these costs be \ncovered? \nAlthough FWO has no earmarked budget \nat its disposal to support correct research \ndata management, FWO allows for part of \nthe allocated project budget  to be \nused to cover the cost incurred.Based on the last two years expenses and data storage forecast, NERF costs for the \nstorage system comprises the hardware itself, and license and maintenance costs. \nThe former amounts to 45000 € per year and the latter to 15000 € per year. These \ncosts are covered by the NERF central budget.\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 12Data security: how will you ensure that\nthe data are securely stored and not \naccessed or modified by unauthorized \npersons? NERF servers are in imec campus at Leuven. Thus, we have strong network protection\nas provided by imec firewalls. Moreover, imec provides a dedicated VLAN for NERF, \nmeaning that only registered devices can access to the NERF network from the imec \ncampus. \nFor users outside of the imec campus, a Cisco AnyConnect VPN can be used to access\nto the NERF network. The VPN login authorization is setup by two factors \nauthentification for each user. This VPN is provided and maintained by imec. \nIn addition to that network security, the access to our storage servers from user \ncomputers is via SMB protocol. Therefore, each research group at NERF has their own\n“SMB accounts ” as setup in the storage server by the system admin. \nConsequently, whether a device in-imec-campust or out-imec-campus attempts to \naccess to the NERF network and thereafter to NERF storage servers, security layers \non the network side and server accounts have to be passed first. This strongly \nreduces the likelihood that unauthorized persons access to NERF data. \n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 136.Data preservation  after the end of the FWO project\nFWO expects that data generated during the project are retained for a period of minimally 5 years after the end of the\nproject, in as far as legal and contractual agreements allow.\nWhich data will be retained for the \nexpected 5 year period after the end \nof the project? In case only a selection \nof the data can/will be preserved, \nclearly state the reasons  for this (legal\nor contractual restrictions, physical \npreservation issues, ...).REVIEW THIS WITH YOUR PI\nThe minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied \nto all datasets. All datasets will be stored on the university's central servers with \nautomatic back-up procedures for at least 5 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM \npolicy.\nIf applicable:\nDatasets collected in the context of clinical research, which fall under the scope of \nthe Belgian Law of 7 May 2004, will be archived for 25 years, in agreement with UZ \nLeuven policy and the European Regulation 536/2014 on clinical trials of medicinal \nproducts for human use.\nWhere will these data be archived (= \nstored for the long term)? Data that needs long term storage is stored in nerfhf01.\nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during these 5 years? \nHow will the costs be covered?\nAlthough FWO has no earmarked budget \nat its disposal to support correct research \ndata management, FWO allows for part of \nthe allocated project budget  to be \nused to cover the cost incurred.That amounts roughly to 60000 € per year, and will be covered by the NERF central \nbudget.\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 147.Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or \npreventing the sharing of (some of) \nthe data (e.g. as defined in an \nagreement with a 3rd party, legal \nrestrictions)? No\nWhich data will be made available \nafter the end of the project? Participants to the present project are committed to publish research results to \ncommunicate them to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting \npublications will be made openly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data \nmay be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested\nresearchers and/or potential new collaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. \nnegative data).\nWe aim at communicating our results in top journals that require full disclosure upon \npublication of all included data, either in the main text, in supplementary material or \nin a data repository if requested by the journal and following deposit advice given by \nthe journal. Depending on the journal, accessibility restrictions may apply.\nBiological material will be distributed to other parties if requested\nWhere/how will the data be made \navailable for reuse? Upon request by mail\nWhen will the data be made available?\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 15Who will be able to access the data \nand under what conditions?  Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly \navailable through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, \nmetadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse, \nand will be conform to community norms. These repositories clearly describe their \nconditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) \nPublic Domain Dedication, a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) or an ODC Public \nDomain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable).\nInterested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give \ncredit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. For data \nshared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure \nagreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly \ndescribe the types of reuse that are permitted.\nFor the Raes lab:\nData will be accessible to academic researchers via the European Genome-Phenome \nArchive. For industry, data access will be subject to specific contracts.\nWhat are the expected costs for data \nsharing? How will these costs be \ncovered? \nAlthough FWO has no earmarked budget \nat its disposal to support correct research \ndata management, FWO allows for part of \nthe allocated project budget  to be \nused to cover the cost incurred.It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard \nprocedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the \nstart of the project, and by using free-to-use data repositories and dissemination \nfacilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the \nlaboratory budget. A budget for publication costs has been requested in this project.\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 168.Responsibilities\nWho will be responsible for the data \ndocumentation & metadata? Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data \ncollection and analysis, by taking careful notes in dedicated files (like Excel).\nIn addition, as indicated in the section 11, jobs launched in the nerfcluster will \nautomatically create metadata, where the responsable is the system administrator of \nNERF.\nWho will be responsible for data \nstorage & back up during the project? As long as the data is in the central storage system of NERF, the responsable is the \nsystem administrator of NERF.\nWho will be responsible for ensuring \ndata preservation and sharing? The researchers involved and the PI.\nWho bears the end responsibility for \nupdating & implementing this DMP? \nDefault response : The PI bears the overall \nresponsibility for updating & implementing\nthis DMPThe PI is ultimately responsable for all data management during and after data \ncollection, including implementation ad updating DMP."
