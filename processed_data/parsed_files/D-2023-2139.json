Nonetheless, many applications of CE are failing to: reduce absolute resource input; address issues in current\neconomic order; and balance the three sustainability dimensions – environmental, economic and social. In addition, users’ participation in\nCircular Design initiatives remains rarely disclosed. Motivated by those issues, this strategic basic research proposes a novel framework\nfor rethinking Circular Design as a Participatory and inclusive practice in Architecture by using Information and Communication\nTechnology (ICT) tools. Two projects will be used as testbeds: 'Woonbox' and 'Solidary Mobile Housing', both realized by\nSamenlevingsopbouw in collaboration with Altering Practices for Urban Inclusion Research Group.\nThe research aims at: 1. developing an Integrative Conceptual Framework bridging Circular Design and Participatory Design; 2. Exploring\ncircular and participatory solutions in the existing projects; 3. Implementing social-spatial aspects as Key Performance Indicators in\nCircular Building Assessment tools; 5. Testing existing ICT tools; 6. developing guidelines for socio-spatial inclusion in Participatory\nCircular Design; 7. Creating an Interactive 3D-platform for Participatory Circular Design in Architecture, allowing involvement of multiple\nparticipants along different stages of the design process.\nLast modified: \n13-05-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be\nused. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.\nQuestion not answered.\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 13 May 2023\n6 of 8\n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nData Storage during the research: OneDrive for Business for staff and students (2TB). The OneDrive account offers extensive possibilities to collaborate within and outside KU Leuven. Its access\nis done via web browser and a multifactor sync app, which makes it suitable to storage even strictly confidential data, provided extra precautions are taken.\nData storage after the research: KU Leuven Research Data Repository (RDR).  RDR is capable of storing large amounts of data, allowing to set the accessibility of the files, and can keep the data\nfor the 10 year minimum imposed by KU Leuven. RDR shares data according to the FAIR principles and it also assigns digital object identifiers (DOIs) to uploaded data to make it easily citable.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nThe OneDrive for Business cloud storage being used already provides an automatic backups. \nOn top of that, important files backups will be made periodically on an external hard-drive. Physical paper-based data and documentation files will be stored in clearly labeled folders in my office\ncabinet and will be digitalized to the folders of its corresponding dataset when possible and relevant.\nThe KU Leuven Repository being used at the end of the research (RDR) will be maintained by the ICT support from the KU Leuven organization and will be monitored by the Research's\nsupervisor, Prof. Chiara Piccardo.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThe OneDrive cloud storage already offers 2TB of space, which is more than enough when compared to the estimated total amount of volume for the research (around 550GB).\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nPhysical & paper-based data and documentation files will be stored in clearly labeled folders in my office cabinet. If personal &/or confidential data is physically stored, it will be done so inside a\ncabinet that is only open by the use of a key that only myself and my supervisor will have access to. The digitalized files will be destroyed soon after its digitalization process.\nParticipants of the research will receive Informed Consent Forms before any activities that might require use of their image or personal information. Eventual stored personal data will undergo\nextra encryption using 7-zip software. Only the researcher and supervisors involved in the PhD will have access to the data and the password to access it, unless elsewhere specified. As such,\nfolders containing personal data will have controlled access by establishing ‘no access’, ‘read only’, ‘read and write’ or ‘administrator’ permissions. A README.txt file will be added to these folders,\nexplaining the Use Agreements of the data.\nDuring Research activities that may include participants who do not agree to being photographed/recorded, they will receive distinctive badges for correct anonymization. All data no longer\nneeded will be destroyed in a consistent manner.\nNon-disclosure agreements will be provided if confidential data is manipulated.\nMoreover, at KU Leuven, a multifactor authentication app is used to provide additional protection to all types of data.\n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nNo extra costs for data storage are expected as OneDrive cloud storage and RDR Repository are offered for free for KU Leuven staff.\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be\npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\nOnly relevant data for the reassessing of the research will be preserved. This is special true to the following datasets:\n- Desk Research & other activities\n- Design Driven Research: \n- Digital Platform - building design\n- Digital Platform - database & backend \n- Digital Platform - results & frontend\nThe remaining datasets will be screened and will have data carefully selected in order to not keep unwanted, irrelevant (personal) data in the storage for the following 10 years. \nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nFor the long-term, the data will be archived at the KU Leuven Research Data Repository (RDR).  RDR is capable of storing large amounts of data, allowing to set the accessibility of the files, and\ncan keep the data for the 10 year minimum imposed by KU Leuven. RDR shares data according to the FAIR principles and it also assigns digital object identifiers (DOIs) to uploaded data to make\nit easily citable.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nNo extra costs are expected.\n5. Data sharing and reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 13 May 2023\n7 of 8\navailable.\nQuestion not answered.\nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.\nQuestion not answered.\nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment\nsection per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nQuestion not answered.\nWhere will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.\nQuestion not answered.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nQuestion not answered.\nWhich data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why.\nQuestion not answered.\nDo you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section.\nQuestion not answered.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nDeposition of smaller datasets in data repositories is usually covered by the repository and for sharing physical data the cost are typically paid by the researcher requesting the materials. For larger\ndatasets repositories may charge a fee.\n6. Responsibilities\nWho will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project?\nThe Researcher \nWho will manage data storage and backup during the research project?\nThe Research Supervisor \nWho will manage data preservation and sharing?\nThe Research supervisor \nWho will update and implement this DMP?\nThe Researcher and supervisor \nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Datasets that will make use of personal data to some degree: - Interviews & Focus Groups - Research Activities - Written files - Research Activities - Multimedia - Design Driven Research Personal data stored/processed: - Age - Gender - Email Address - Level of education/expertise - Profession/Field of studies Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes Datasets with potential commercial valorization: - Digital Platform - building design - Digital Platform - database & backend - Digital Platform - results & frontend A Creative Commons License might apply in the future. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements/ research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. No Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. Yes The digital platform foreseen will be part of a Creative Commons License. However, some data might include Intellectual Property Rights and ownership agreement in case an external partner takes part in the development of the platform. This, nevertheless, is something still to be discussed in the final phases of the research. 2. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). Datasets: - Interviews & Focus Groups : - Research Activities - Written files: - Research Activities - Multimedia: For all three above datasets, a README.txt file will be created containing: the methodology used to collect data; the definition of relevant variables/information; encrypted information for personal data manipulation; license agreements that might apply. (a encrypted folder containing personal data will be created). - Desk Research & other activities: README.txt containing info on methods applied and structure of the folders containing supporting bibliography and final publications. - Design Driven Research: For the three datasets below, a README.txt will be created containing info on methods applied and structure of the folders. Moreover, a special document will be created to describe the database structure containing also a 'how-to' description of how to re-test the results and further use the platform. - Digital Platform - building design - Digital Platform - database & backend - Digital Platform - results & frontend Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. Question not answered. Created using DMPonline.be.

Data Storage during the research: OneDrive for Business for staff and students (2TB). The OneDrive account offers extensive possibilities to collaborate within and outside KU Leuven. Its access is done via web browser and a multifactor sync app, which makes it suitable to storage even strictly confidential data, provided extra precautions are taken. Data storage after the research: KU Leuven Research Data Repository (RDR). RDR is capable of storing large amounts of data, allowing to set the accessibility of the files, and can keep the data for the 10 year minimum imposed by KU Leuven. RDR shares data according to the FAIR principles and it also assigns digital object identifiers (DOIs) to uploaded data to make it easily citable. How will the data be backed up? The OneDrive for Business cloud storage being used already provides an automatic backups. On top of that, important files backups will be made periodically on an external hard-drive. Physical paper-based data and documentation files will be stored in clearly labeled folders in my office cabinet and will be digitalized to the folders of its corresponding dataset when possible and relevant. The KU Leuven Repository being used at the end of the research (RDR) will be maintained by the ICT support from the KU Leuven organization and will be monitored by the Research's supervisor, Prof. Chiara Piccardo. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes The OneDrive cloud storage already offers 2TB of space, which is more than enough when compared to the estimated total amount of volume for the research (around 550GB). How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Physical & paper-based data and documentation files will be stored in clearly labeled folders in my office cabinet. If personal &/or confidential data is physically stored, it will be done so inside a cabinet that is only open by the use of a key that only myself and my supervisor will have access to. The digitalized files will be destroyed soon after its digitalization process. Participants of the research will receive Informed Consent Forms before any activities that might require use of their image or personal information. Eventual stored personal data will undergo extra encryption using 7-zip software. Only the researcher and supervisors involved in the PhD will have access to the data and the password to access it, unless elsewhere specified. As such, folders containing personal data will have controlled access by establishing ‘no access’, ‘read only’, ‘read and write’ or ‘administrator’ permissions. A README.txt file will be added to these folders, explaining the Use Agreements of the data. During Research activities that may include participants who do not agree to being photographed/recorded, they will receive distinctive badges for correct anonymization. All data no longer needed will be destroyed in a consistent manner. Non-disclosure agreements will be provided if confidential data is manipulated. Moreover, at KU Leuven, a multifactor authentication app is used to provide additional protection to all types of data. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? No extra costs for data storage are expected as OneDrive cloud storage and RDR Repository are offered for free for KU Leuven staff. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Only relevant data for the reassessing of the research will be preserved. This is special true to the following datasets: - Desk Research & other activities - Design Driven Research: - Digital Platform - building design - Digital Platform - database & backend - Digital Platform - results & frontend The remaining datasets will be screened and will have data carefully selected in order to not keep unwanted, irrelevant (personal) data in the storage for the following 10 years. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? For the long-term, the data will be archived at the KU Leuven Research Data Repository (RDR). RDR is capable of storing large amounts of data, allowing to set the accessibility of the files, and can keep the data for the 10 year minimum imposed by KU Leuven. RDR shares data according to the FAIR principles and it also assigns digital object identifiers (DOIs) to uploaded data to make it easily citable. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? No extra costs are expected. 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 13 May 2023 7 of 8 available. Question not answered. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Question not answered. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. Question not answered. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. Question not answered. When will the data be made available? Question not answered. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. Question not answered. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. Question not answered. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Deposition of smaller datasets in data repositories is usually covered by the repository and for sharing physical data the cost are typically paid by the researcher requesting the materials. For larger datasets repositories may charge a fee. 6. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project? The Researcher Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project? The Research Supervisor Who will manage data preservation and sharing? The Research supervisor Who will update and implement this DMP? The Researcher and supervisor Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 13 May 2023 8 of 8"
