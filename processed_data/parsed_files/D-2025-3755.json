To achieve these objectives, we will develop a theoretical\nframework for the comparative analysis of philosophy textbooks and integrate insights from textbook research, metaphilosophy, and\ndidactics of philosophy. The proposed research will make a substantial contribution to the understanding of philosophy as a discipline\nand to didactics of philosophy, as we will investigate which different forms philosophy education takes in terms of content and didactics,\nwhich image of philosophy and its practice is passed on to subsequent generations, and how the specificity of philosophy as a discipline\ninfluences its philosophical-didactic approach. \nID: \nID: \n211852\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-10-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n30-09-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n26-03-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
