This will be followed up through regular meetings with KU Leuven LRD, who will evaluate \nand protect potential IP generated during the project that could lead to val orization actions. In this case, IP \nwill (i) not be shared, (ii) put under embargo, or (iii) a suitable license will be applied to the data when \npublished (e.g. Creative Commons License).  \n \n \n \n3. Documentation and Metadata  \n \nClearly describe what approach will be followed \nto capture the accompanying information \nnecessary to keep data understandable and \nusable , for yourself and others, now and in the \nfuture (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and \ntypes required, procedures used, Electronic Lab \nNotebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. \nwhere this information is recorded ). \n \nRDM guidance on documentation and metadata . \n The Biosensors group uses the electronic lab notebook in which a number of predetermined topics have to \nbe described for each experiment (objective, protocol, results, and conclusion). The electronic lab notebook \nfacilitates searching for particular metada ta through a search engine. By mimicking the folder structure of \nthe electronic lab notebook in the server -based folder with the experimental data, linking of the metadata \nto the actual data will be facilitated.  \nAs a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that \nsupport FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org). When depositing data in a local or public repository, the \nfinal dataset will be accompanied by this i nformation in a README.txt document, following the Dublin Core \nMetadata standard if no other meta -standard is available yet. This file will be located in the top -level \ndirectory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the filenaming convention \nused.  \nThis will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to \nthe dataset for future reuse. For each peer -reviewed article, a separate folder will be made on the server, \ncontaining the latest Word version and all raw and processed data used in the article. In addition, a separate \nfile will be made in the electronic lab notebook for each article, containing clickable links to all metadata \nfiles of data that were used in that particular article, to facilitate tracing  back of protocols, results and \nconclusions.  \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        9 \n Will a metadata standard be used to make it \neasier to find and reuse the data ?  \n \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard \nwill be used. If not, please specify which \nmetadata will be created to make the data \neasier to find and reuse.  \n \nREPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN \nFORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. \nSTANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . \n ☒ Yes \n☐ No \nIf yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata  standard  will be used :  \n \nTo guarantee reusable aspect of data, sufficient documentation and methods information will be provided, \nwhereas CC -BY license will be attached to data through data repositories.  \n \nIf no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created:  \n \n \n \n \n \n4.

If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities  are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.  ☒ Yes \n☐ No \n \nDuring, as well as after the project, KU Leuven can provide sufficient storage and backup capacity. A dedicated \nfolder is made for the project to store data files  \n \nIf no, please specify :  \n \nHow will you ensure that the data are securely \nstored and not accessed or modified by \nunauthorized persons?  \n \nCLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , \nNETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND \nFILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND \nTRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE .  \nGuidance on security for research data   \n The network drive for the project shared folder and the large volume storage folder are secured by the ICTS \nservice of KU Leuven with a mirror copy. Confidential data can and will be protected with a password (available \nonly for PI Jeroen Lammertyn). Visit ors, MSc thesis students and internship students in the groups as well as \nother unauthorized persons will not have access to the data on the shared folder. Data storage in the cloud will \nbe avoided, unless for temporary use only, e.g., to transfer large fi les between the researchers involved in the \nproject.  \n \n \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?  Type 1 server back -end storage with mirror backup for the project shared folder will be used. Using the shared \nnetwork drive (J -drive) and large volume storage (K -drive) cost respectively 450.76  Euro per TB per year and \n95.14  Euro per TB per year. Costs will first be covered by the project consumables budget. If additional storage \nwould be required for sequencing data, my co -promotor Prof. Voet has acquired a large -scale VLIR \ninfrastructure grant to procure high -volume data st orage as part of the Leuven Ins titute of Single -Cell Omics \n(LISCO) which could be used for this project.  \n \n \n \n \n5. Data Preservation  after the end of the Research P roject  \n \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        11 \n Which data will be retained for at least five \nyears (or longer, in agreement with other \nretention policies that are applicable) after the \nend of the  project? In case some data cannot be \npreserved , clearly state the reasons for this  \n(e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). \n Guidance on data preservation  ☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy  \n☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with \nmedicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans  \n☐ Certain data cannot be ke pt for 10 years (explain)  \n \n \n \n \nWhere will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long -term)?  \n \nDedicated data repositories  are often the best place \nto preserve your data . Data not suitable for \npreservation in a repository can be stored using a KU \nLeuven storage solution, consult the  interactive  KU \nLeuven  storage guide . ☒ KU Leuven RDR  \n☒ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes)  \n☒ Shared network drive (J -drive)  \n☐ Other (specifiy):  \n \n \n \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during the expected retention \nperiod? How will these costs be covered?  \n \n • The volume corresponding to dissemination data is expected to be relatively low (< 100 GB ), and \ntherefore can be embedded on the (K:) drive of KU Leuven. The costs ( 9500  EUR/year) will be \ncovered by other on -going projects at that point in time.  \n• For other relevant research data  at the end of the project , at current archiving costs of 10 0 \nEuro/(TB*year), we estimate a cost of 2000 Euro/year. These  costs will be covered by funding \nacquired by the project PIs in the context of other research projects.  \n•  If additional storage would be required for sequencing data, my co -promotor Prof. Voet has \nacquired a large -scale VLIR infrastructure grant to procure high -volume data storage as part of the \nLeuven Institute of Single -Cell Omics (LISCO) which could be use d for this project.  \n \n \n6.

If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number . ☐ Yes, human subject data ; provide SMEC or EC a pproval number: ☐ Yes, animal data ; provide ECD reference number: ☐ Yes, dual use; provide approva l number : ☒ No Additional information : Will you process personal data4? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number). ☐ Yes (provide PRET G -number or EC S -number below) ☒ No Additional information: Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer , for example spin - offs, commercial exploitation, … )? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate . ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes , please comment : The developed tools for live cell sampling have potential for commercial valorization. If these research findings have potential for patent filing, scientific staff working on this project will discuss this with the IOF manager in the group and LRD to make sure that data are protected prior to publications. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements , research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 8 Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please explain: Due to the generation of IP, restrictions in data sharing might potentially be implemented. This will be followed up through regular meetings with KU Leuven LRD, who will evaluate and protect potential IP generated during the project that could lead to val orization actions. In this case, IP will (i) not be shared, (ii) put under embargo, or (iii) a suitable license will be applied to the data when published (e.g. Creative Commons License). 3. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata . The Biosensors group uses the electronic lab notebook in which a number of predetermined topics have to be described for each experiment (objective, protocol, results, and conclusion). The electronic lab notebook facilitates searching for particular metada ta through a search engine. By mimicking the folder structure of the electronic lab notebook in the server -based folder with the experimental data, linking of the metadata to the actual data will be facilitated. As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org). When depositing data in a local or public repository, the final dataset will be accompanied by this i nformation in a README.txt document, following the Dublin Core Metadata standard if no other meta -standard is available yet. This file will be located in the top -level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the filenaming convention used. This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse. For each peer -reviewed article, a separate folder will be made on the server, containing the latest Word version and all raw and processed data used in the article. In addition, a separate file will be made in the electronic lab notebook for each article, containing clickable links to all metadata files of data that were used in that particular article, to facilitate tracing back of protocols, results and conclusions. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : To guarantee reusable aspect of data, sufficient documentation and methods information will be provided, whereas CC -BY license will be attached to data through data repositories. If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data. ☒ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I -drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☒ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on -premis ☒ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☐ Other: How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? ☒ Standard back -up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back -ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10 Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No During, as well as after the project, KU Leuven can provide sufficient storage and backup capacity. A dedicated folder is made for the project to store data files If no, please specify : How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . Guidance on security for research data The network drive for the project shared folder and the large volume storage folder are secured by the ICTS service of KU Leuven with a mirror copy. Confidential data can and will be protected with a password (available only for PI Jeroen Lammertyn). Visit ors, MSc thesis students and internship students in the groups as well as other unauthorized persons will not have access to the data on the shared folder. Data storage in the cloud will be avoided, unless for temporary use only, e.g., to transfer large fi les between the researchers involved in the project. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Type 1 server back -end storage with mirror backup for the project shared folder will be used. Using the shared network drive (J -drive) and large volume storage (K -drive) cost respectively 450.76 Euro per TB per year and 95.14 Euro per TB per year. Costs will first be covered by the project consumables budget. If additional storage would be required for sequencing data, my co -promotor Prof. Voet has acquired a large -scale VLIR infrastructure grant to procure high -volume data st orage as part of the Leuven Ins titute of Single -Cell Omics (LISCO) which could be used for this project. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11 Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). Guidance on data preservation ☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be ke pt for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data . Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide . ☒ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☒ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? • The volume corresponding to dissemination data is expected to be relatively low (< 100 GB ), and therefore can be embedded on the (K:) drive of KU Leuven. The costs ( 9500 EUR/year) will be covered by other on -going projects at that point in time. • For other relevant research data at the end of the project , at current archiving costs of 10 0 Euro/(TB*year), we estimate a cost of 2000 Euro/year. These costs will be covered by funding acquired by the project PIs in the context of other research projects. • If additional storage would be required for sequencing data, my co -promotor Prof. Voet has acquired a large -scale VLIR infrastructure grant to procure high -volume data storage as part of the Leuven Institute of Single -Cell Omics (LISCO) which could be use d for this project. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12 Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE ’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE , CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY . AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS . FOR MORE INFORMATION : HTTPS ://WIKI.SURFNET .NL/DISPLAY /STANDARDS /INFO-EU- REPO /#INFOEUREPO -ACCESS RIGHTS ☒ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☐ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Only researchers participating in the project will be able to access the data for the duration of the project. As soon as the article associated with the data is ready for publication, the data will be made open through the institutional repositories mentioned in 2.1. The data will be deposited in the institutional r epositories: (KU Leuven: Research Data Repository (RDR) Research Data Repository (RDR) - RDR - Research Data Repository (kuleuven.be). Data will be assigned with DOIs to create trustworthy and persistent links for online content . Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☒ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify : Before making data and other research output from the project (e.g. journal articles, book chapters and conference proceedings) openly available, they will be aligned with the project IP strategy to avoid premature disclosure, which can compromise the pate nt filing application(s). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13 Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. ☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Other data repository (specify) ☐ Other (specify) When will the data be made available? ☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS . IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED , THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED . DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT . Check the RDR guidance on licences for data and software sources code or consult the License selector tool to help you choose. ☒ CC-BY 4.0 (data) ☐ Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) ☐ MIT licence (code) ☐ GNU GPL -3.0 (code) ☐ Other (specify) Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here . INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA . ☒ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☐ No FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 14 What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? A restricted access repository can be implemented on a free tool, such as OneDrive, up to a certain volume. If this volume does not suffice, time -limited storage will be considered, thus limited to the time needed to download the data. The costs associated with data storage will be covered by the budget foreseen in the project or on other projects running in the group . 7. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project? Jolien Breukers Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project? Jolien Breukers Who will manage data preservation and sharing? Jeroen Lammertyn Who will update and implement this DMP? Jolien Breukers, Jeroen Lammertyn"
