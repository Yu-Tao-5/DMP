DIGITAL DATA VOLUME: PLEASE ESTIMATE THE UPPER LIMIT OF THE VOLUME OF THE DATA PER DATASET OR DATA TYPE. PHYSICAL VOLUME: PLEASE ESTIMATE THE PHYSICAL VOLUME OF THE RESEARCH MATERIALS (FOR EXAMPLE THE NUMBER OF RELEVANT BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES THAT NEED TO BE STORED AND PRESERVED DURING THE PROJECT AND/OR AFTER). If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type. NA Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, please describe these issues further and refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate.☐ Yes, human subject data ☐ Yes, animal data ☒ Yes, dual use ☐ No If yes, please describe: Dataset “Patient Data” The Ethics Committee Research UZ Leuven/KU Leuven approved the use of samples of patients and healthy controls for the purposes of this research project (S66508/2022 ECD). Dataset “Experimental data” Ethical approval of animal studies has also been granted by the Committee for Animal Experimentation at KU Leuven (project 046/2021: Regulation of extracellular proteolysis by microglia and brain-infiltrating macrophages). 5 These data are generated by combining multiple existing datasets. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 7Will you process personal data6? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. If available, add the reference to your file in your host institution's privacy register.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes: -Short description of the kind of personal data that will be used: Dataset “Patient Data” We will use personal data of patients and healthy controls included in the study (S66508). The collected patient data consist of general characteristics (i.e. age, sex) as well as disease-specific information (e.g. plasma levels of inflammatory markers, type of treatment, etc.) and the results of functional assays and immunophenotyping of leukocytes. The data of healthy controls consist of general characteristics and the results of functional assays and immunophenotyping of leukocytes. All patient data will be collected by Prof. Dr. Lien De Somer, Prof. Dr. Katrien Jansen and Prof. Dr. Liesbeth De Waele after gaining informed consent. When the researchers receive the patient data, this data is always pseudonymized to make patient name tracing impossible. -Privacy Registry Reference: G-2022-5212 PRET and S66508/2022 CTC Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin- offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please comment: 6 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 8Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please explain: An MTA agreement is in place for the use of HexB mice. This agreement states that that the RECIPIENT (Prof. Dr. Patrick Matthys) shall provide the PROVIDER (Prof. Dr. Macro Prinz) with an advance copy of any proposed publication or disclosure for its review at least thirty (30) days prior to the scheduled disclosure of the RESULTS. The PROVIDER may request that the RECIPIENT deletes any reference to the PROVIDER’s confidential information. Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3.Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded).Documentation including experimental protocols, breeding schemes, and observational numeric data will be recorded in physical lab books and stored into Word or Excel files, which automatically imprint the metadata (user, date, time, equipment parameters) from these experiments. Data folders containing raw and processed data will be hierarchically organized and labelled based on the date of data generation, the number of the experiment and the source of the data. Imaging data will be created by default with metadata imprinted by the image acquisition software automatically. This includes information on user, data and time, duration of experiments, equipment parameters and imaging configurations. The metadata are saved and transferred with the original imaging file. The created data files will be organized in folders named by the data of the experiment (DDMMYYYY) followed by the research who performed it and the title of the experiment. Overall, all files will be stored in the KU Leven shared Storage space (J-Drive), with sharing possibilities via Box Sync and One Drive (managed by the KU Leuven IT department). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Electronical data will be stored in conformity with KU Leuven and FWO RDM policy. All datatypes, including protocols, raw data and analysed data, will be stored at a shared Rega Drive. We will keep a copy of all data on an external hard disc and/or computer, and on the KU Leuven One drive account, except for “the patient dataset”. There is sufficient storage and backup available at the Rega Institute. In case additional storage is required, the KU Leuven data centre provides storage on two additional locations, in order to preserve data for a period of more than 20 years. Hard copy notebooks with raw data will be stored physically in our laboratory. Informed consents will be stored by the treating clinicians (UZ Leuven). Physical samples will be stored in the KU Leuven/UZ Leuven Biobank. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.We will use the central server storage of KU Leuven (Data centre ICTS Luna storage), which provides a daily automatic back up. Moreover, the data will be backed up on the Rega Institute Virtual Drives (Rega NAS (network adapted storage)) and on external hard-drives kept by the investigators. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: Enough storage and back-up capacity is available at the systems of Rega Institute. All data will be stored on the J-drive, which has an unlimited maximum size (shared storage). Backup will be stored on the K-drive which has an unlimited maximum size (archive storage). If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7Direct access to research data will be restricted to laboratory members, project members and collaborators. To protect our data, the shared Rega drive is secured with a login connected to your personal KU Leuven account and password. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Long-term data storage and costs will be managed by the principal investigator working in the project, Prof. Patrick Matthys and our IT-manager (Mr Dieter Devos). The cost for data storage is 519 euro/TB/year, thus the accumulated cost for 4 years is approximately 2000 euro. The costs will be covered by previous funding obtained by the host lab and by the bench fee offered by the FWO PhD fellowship. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).“Patient data” will be preserved for 20 years as required by the informed consent form of the ethical committee of UZ Leuven. All other research data will be stored up to 5 years after the end of the project. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?Data will be stored redundantly during and after the research in the KU Leuven data centers (ICTS Luna storage [J:// drive], [K:// drive], and Rega NAS [network adapted storage]). What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?The cost for data storage is 519 euro/TB/year. Long-term data storage and costs will be managed and evaluated by the principal investigator of this project, i.e. my promotor Prof. Patrick Matthys. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 126. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY.
