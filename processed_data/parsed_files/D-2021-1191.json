If so, to what data do they\nrelate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this project?\nFor each WP, meta-data will be available and stored in a separate folder. Depending on the WP, the folder will contain the following information:\n1.  Read.me file: In this document, we will include general information (involved researchers, contact persons with access to dataset), project\ninformation (abstract and funder), a file overview (including list of file names, software used, version and date), storage information,\nmethodological information (data collection and processing), information on data access and sharing, specific information about the data\nthemselves, and relationships (related publications, related datasets).\n2. Codebook file (for survey data): In this document, we will provide pseudonymised baseline information about all participants enrolled in the\nstudy and variable-level information (names, labels, values/scoring) for survey data.\n3. Interview guide: In this document, we will describe the setting of the interviews, instructions for the interviewer, and topics discussed during\nthe interview.\n4. Logbook file: In this document, we will describe the steps for data preparation and analysis of both survey data (for WP1 and WP3) and\ninterview data (for WP2, including pseudonymisation procedure and development of codes). Explanatory comments will be added to all analysis\nscripts in R for survey data and within NVivo for interview data.\n5. Folder with all the study documents: Ethical application and approval, informed consent example, participant information letter. The pdf of all\nquestionnaires will be included.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be used. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata\nwill be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nSee previous question\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nPersonal information and data from interviews and questionnaires will be stored with a unique participant ID, ensuring pseudonymisation.\nStrictly confidential data (e.g. personal information, contact information, informed consent forms, audio recordings of interviews etc.) will be\nstored at a separate restricted area of KU Leuvenâ€™s OneDrive for Business. This data can only be accessed by researchers in contact with\nparticipants or directly involved in anonymisation/transcription of interview data as well as the doctoral student's supervisor using Multifactor\nauthentication.\nData from surveys, interview transcripts will be pseudonymised via this participant ID and securely stored on KU Leuven's OneDrive for\nBuseiness, which is only accessible to involved researchers and the doctoral student's supervisor using Multifactor authentication. All drives\nused for data storage are managed by ICTS personnel, bound by the KUL ICT code of conduct, and have automatic back-up procedures and\ndisaster recovery in place.\nThis data storage plan was developed using the online Data Management storage of the KU Leuven and the PPW Data Classification and Storage\nGuidelines.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe data will be stored on KU Leuven's OneDrive for Business with automatic daily back-up procedures.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage\nor backup capacities are available then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThe PhD student has 2TB personal Onedrive storage (https://icts.kuleuven.be/sc/english/storage/onedrive). Given the nature of our data, we do\nnot expect to exceed this storage or backup capacity. In case we still do so, we will extend our storage capacity.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these costs be covered?\nAs mentioned before, we do not expect extra costs for data storage. In case we need to extend the storage capacity, costs will be covered by\nthe PhD student's bench fee.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nAll data will be stored on KU Leuvenâ€™s secure network storage (i.e., Onedrive for Business). This means that data are stored on a secure and\nencrypted network provided by the KU Leuven and data transfer will always take place in encrypted format via secured channels only (e.g.,\nBelnet sender).\nResearch data will be pseudonymised. Each participant's record will be stored pseudonymised by which the personally identifiable information\nwill be removed and replaced by a participant ID. Only the researchers directly in contact with participants and the doctoral student's\nsupervisor will have access to the linking file using Multifactor authentication. Involved researchers will have role-based access to reserach data\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 3\nusing Multifactor authentication.\nIn case interviews will be conducted online (due to COVID-19 measures or for practical reasons), the interview will be recorded through\nMicrosoft Teams, a university's secured platform. The audio record will be deleted once the interview of that participant has been fully\ntranscribed. The transcriptions will be preserved for 10 years after the end of the study.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a selection of the data\ncan/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAfter data collection is completed for a WP, all identifiable information (i.e., participantsâ€™ names, contact details, etc.) and the file linking\nparticipants' names to participant ID will be deleted since this information will no longer be relevant or required for study purposes. Due to the\nsensitive nature of the data, all audio recordings of the interviews will be deleted once the interviews have been fully transcribed. Personal and\nfield notes on paper will be saved together with interview transcripts in word files. Once the notes have been saved electronically, paper notes\nwill be destroyed. All other data will be stored for at least 10 years following KU Leuven regulations.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nIn line with the KU Leuven RDM policy, all research data will be stored for at least 10 years. Data will be copied to the supervisor's (Filip Raes)\nOnedrive account. Secondly, data will be temporarily shared with our data manager who will then store the data on our password-protected and\nencrypted local research group storage as a back-up.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered?\nThe cost for data preservation for ten years on our local research group storage will be around 36â‚¬. These costs will be covered by the\nsupervisor and/or the research group.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd\nparty, legal restrictions)?\nYes. Specify:\nThe data can only be used for the purpose of improving scientific knowledge about mindfulness. Copied from Informed Consent:\n\"Ik ga ermee akkoord dat de onderzoeksgegevens die voor het hier vermelde onderzoek worden verzameld, later zullen worden verwerkt, op\nvoorwaarde dat deze verwerking beperkt blijft tot de context van het hier vermelde onderzoek voor een beter inzicht in mindfulness-meditatie\nen de effecten ervan.\"\nFor WP2, participants consent to using excerpts of the interview for scientific publication given that they cannot be identified. Full transcripts\n(including personal and field notes and codes) cannto be shared to ensure privacy.\nWe are still awaiting feedback from our collaborators at the University of Exeter regarding the reuse of data that they shared with us. Once the\ndata sharing agreement is set up, the possibilities to share and reuse those existing data will be further specified in the data management plan.\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nThe full pseudonymised dataset (pseudonymised questionnaire data and interview transcripts) will be available for colleague researchers in\norder to improve the scientific knowledge about mindfulness. Data is only available upon request (and signing a data sharing agreement).\nParticipantsâ€™ personal information (e.g., contact information, names, etc.) or audio files will never be shared.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nUpon request by mail\nIn order to improve the scientific knowledge about mindfulness, researchers can request the full pseudonymised dataset with documentation\n(including readme files, codebooks and logbooks) via email, and will receive these after signing a data sharing agreement.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nThe dataset of a WP will be made available after publication of the research results of this WP.\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nAccess will be considered after a request is submitted explaining the planned reuse. Only uses for research purposes that are in line with the\nexplained purpose of the study will be allowed and commercial reuse will be excluded. Researchers have to comply with the confidentiality rules\nfor the given data and will have to sign a data sharing agreement in which the researcher states he will give appropriate credit to the creators.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nNone\n8. Responsibilities\nWho will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?\nThe PhD student (Merle Kock) will be responsible.\nWho will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nThe PhD student (Merle Kock) will be responsible.\nWho will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ?\nThe PhD student (Merle Kock) and the supervisor (Filip Raes) will be responsible.\nWho bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nThe supervisor (Filip Raes) bears the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 3"
