At the end of the experiment, raw data (see section 2) and processed data (.xls) will be  \nsaved on the K-drive.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nBesides regularly provided automated backups by ICTS (of J-drive, K-drive), the data stored on personal  \nPCs and J-drive will be weekly backed up on the personal KU Leuven I-drive, and the own Dropbox of the  \nlabs concerned (password-protected). Every two months, additional backups will be made on external hard  \ndisks, as an extra security measurement. MS data, RNA-seq data and imaging data will be backed up by  \ncopying to an SSD. External SSD hard-disks (up to 1-2 TB storage capacity) keep the storage costs feasible  \nsince cost of an external hard drive is cheaper than ICTS storage costs for such big data volumes.  \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will  \nbe taken care of.\n●Yes\nExtra external hard disks will be bought, as appropriate. Same for liquid nitrogen containers or freezers, but  \nsufficient capacity is currently available. \nK-drive: up to 100 GB per PI; in addition, extensions of this volume can be asked for at ICTS at all times (for  \nan additional cost). \n  \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these \ncosts be covered? \n- K-Archive drive costs: 20€/year/100 GB; daily back-ups.  \n- Dropbox: free \n- External hard disks: max. 1500€ (=5 disks of 1-2 TB)  \n  \nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified \nby unauthorized persons?\nThe main data archive on the K-drive is a read-only drive for lab members only (password-protected); only  \nthe PI of the lab concerned can write on this drive (= add data), but not modify data.  \n11J-drive and I-drive: restricted to account of researcher. \nLab Dropbox: access password-protected. \nPaper lab notebooks are kept in locked cabinets. \nDigital lab notebooks: password-protected. \n6. DATA PRESERVATION AFTER THE FWO PROJECT\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case \nonly a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or \ncontractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll generated (raw and processed) data will be preserved, for at least 5 years. \nData underpinning publications: see above (section 5.1, K-drive). \nUnpublished data from unfinished work will be kept for longer than 5 years (ideally, until use in a publication,  \nand then preserved or deposited as per our criteria for published data). \nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nRaw and processed data: K-drive and external SSD hard disks.  \nIn addition, after publication, all Next Generation Sequencing Data will be uploaded to the Gene Expression  \nOmnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ ); and all proteomics data will be deposited to the  \nProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository. \nFrozen sperm of mouse strains (50 straws (5 straws per male, 5 males in total)) are stored in 2 separated  \nLN2 tanks on 2 different sites on the KU Leuven Gasthuisberg campus (done by Mouse Expertise Unit, VIB-\nKU Leuven). \nTissue samples of mice are stored in -80 freezers and paraffin blocks in well-defined boxes.  \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will  \nthe costs be covered?  \nK-Archive drive costs: 20€/year/100 GB  \nExternal hard disks: max. 3000€ (=10 disks of 1-2 TB)  \nCosts are covered by my FWO bench fee and/or by LRD project (Jordan’s Guardian Angels foundation) \nof my PI.\n7. DATA SHARING AND REUSE\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in \nan agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\n●Yes. Specify:\nData sharing with peers will exclusively occur through publications, taking into account the Open Access  \npolicy of KU Leuven. The planned depositions of data in the relevant responsible repositories (as described  \nabove) will only occur after publication. \nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\n12Publications; all data deposited in (public) repositories.  \nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\n●In an Open Access repository\nPublications; all data deposited in (public) repositories.  \nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication during the project, or as soon as possible upon publication after the project.  \nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nPublications and repositories mentioned: all open access.  \nFor unpublished data: only the PI involved (or scientific collaborators who will continue and follow up on the  \nresearch after the project). \nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?  \nPublication costs (Open Access) will be covered by the FWO bench fee.  \n8. RESPONSIBILITIES\nWho will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?\nIris Verbinnen \nWho will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nProf. Veerle Janssens  \nIris Verbinnen \nWho will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ?\nProf. Veerle Janssens  \nWho bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nThe PI bears the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP.

At the end of the experiment, raw data (see section 2) and processed data (.xls) will be saved on the K-drive. How is backup of the data provided? Besides regularly provided automated backups by ICTS (of J-drive, K-drive), the data stored on personal PCs and J-drive will be weekly backed up on the personal KU Leuven I-drive, and the own Dropbox of the labs concerned (password-protected). Every two months, additional backups will be made on external hard disks, as an extra security measurement. MS data, RNA-seq data and imaging data will be backed up by copying to an SSD. External SSD hard-disks (up to 1-2 TB storage capacity) keep the storage costs feasible since cost of an external hard drive is cheaper than ICTS storage costs for such big data volumes. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will be taken care of. ●Yes Extra external hard disks will be bought, as appropriate. Same for liquid nitrogen containers or freezers, but sufficient capacity is currently available. K-drive: up to 100 GB per PI; in addition, extensions of this volume can be asked for at ICTS at all times (for an additional cost). What are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these costs be covered? - K-Archive drive costs: 20€/year/100 GB; daily back-ups. - Dropbox: free - External hard disks: max. 1500€ (=5 disks of 1-2 TB) Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The main data archive on the K-drive is a read-only drive for lab members only (password-protected); only the PI of the lab concerned can write on this drive (= add data), but not modify data. 11J-drive and I-drive: restricted to account of researcher. Lab Dropbox: access password-protected. Paper lab notebooks are kept in locked cabinets. Digital lab notebooks: password-protected. 6. DATA PRESERVATION AFTER THE FWO PROJECT Which data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...). All generated (raw and processed) data will be preserved, for at least 5 years. Data underpinning publications: see above (section 5.1, K-drive). Unpublished data from unfinished work will be kept for longer than 5 years (ideally, until use in a publication, and then preserved or deposited as per our criteria for published data). Where will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)? Raw and processed data: K-drive and external SSD hard disks. In addition, after publication, all Next Generation Sequencing Data will be uploaded to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ ); and all proteomics data will be deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository. Frozen sperm of mouse strains (50 straws (5 straws per male, 5 males in total)) are stored in 2 separated LN2 tanks on 2 different sites on the KU Leuven Gasthuisberg campus (done by Mouse Expertise Unit, VIB- KU Leuven). Tissue samples of mice are stored in -80 freezers and paraffin blocks in well-defined boxes. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered? K-Archive drive costs: 20€/year/100 GB External hard disks: max. 3000€ (=10 disks of 1-2 TB) Costs are covered by my FWO bench fee and/or by LRD project (Jordan’s Guardian Angels foundation) of my PI. 7. DATA SHARING AND REUSE Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? ●Yes. Specify: Data sharing with peers will exclusively occur through publications, taking into account the Open Access policy of KU Leuven. The planned depositions of data in the relevant responsible repositories (as described above) will only occur after publication. Which data will be made available after the end of the project? 12Publications; all data deposited in (public) repositories. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? ●In an Open Access repository Publications; all data deposited in (public) repositories. When will the data be made available? Upon publication during the project, or as soon as possible upon publication after the project. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? Publications and repositories mentioned: all open access. For unpublished data: only the PI involved (or scientific collaborators who will continue and follow up on the research after the project). What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered? Publication costs (Open Access) will be covered by the FWO bench fee. 8.
