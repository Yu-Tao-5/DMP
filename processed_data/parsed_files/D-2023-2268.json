The FWO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.  At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning.

Documentation and Metadata FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11 Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). Metadata will be collected from all experiments performed for clarification. We follow standard metadata schemes, provided and required by the host institution. All metadata will be in English language. Any abbreviations used will be defined. Standard vocabulary, taxonomy and ontology formats are followed. Metadata will provide information about the design of the study, individual samples, experimental approaches and protocols, and references to processed and raw data file names will be provided upon data deposition in repositories. This ensures enough information for data interpretation, supports findability, citation and reuse. We also adhere to standard formats of the data, using only standard programs that are available either for free or for a fee and are commonly used in the scientific community. Excel documents will always be saved in the csv format, so that it can be read as American csv/tab-delimited text or European csv/tab-delimited text. For publication, the standards of the journal in which the data will be published, will be used. For all stored data, a readme-file is provided, which includes a short description of the filename, definitions of column headings and row labels, data processing steps, storage information and contact information. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: Metadata will be kept on file in accordance with the standards for naming required by the host institution, which includes date generated, project ID, and numbering of experiments. In case human fetal samples become available, metadata will be created for the human fetal brain tissues, including from which we obtain the tissues and their gestational week. In the case of animal data, metadata will record all relevant data, which is associated with respective animal label. For all stored data, a readme-file is provided, which includes a short description of the filename, definitions of column headings and row labels, data processing steps, storage information and contact information. All data receives a digital object identifier to ensure persistent identification and easy searchability and discoverability. Search keywords will be provided, so that data will easily be located on the server and cloud storage for other researchers in the lab. If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? All data will be stored on the \"large storage network L-drive\" - KU Leuven LUNA, centrally managed by the central computer, IT department of KU Leuven: ICTS (Informatie en Communicatie: Technologie en Systemen). Additionally, a cloud-based KU Leuven Enterprise BOX is available for the secure storage, management and sharing documents between the research group. Moreover, data can also be stored at the institutional research data repository: RDR from KU Leuven (after completion of the project). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13 How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE. The data will be backed up in a double way. Automatic back-up (every 24 hours) of the network L-drive is controlled by the ICTS KU Leuven department. In addition, every researcher’s computer has installed the Druva Cloud Platform. Druva Cloud protects and manages data across all devices, and allows to perform the backup operations even every 5 minutes (managed individually - depends on the user). Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: The project will generate data less than 100 GB. An unlimited storage space is already available and maintained by the ICTS KU Leuven department. If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7 Research data are stored and managed by the local IT-manager (Urbain Schepereel) and the ICTS KU Leuven department, and are accessible only by the researchers working on the project (access right management & password protection). Moreover, data will be backed up in two ways as stated above. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14 What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Yearly storage costs of 1TB data on large storage servers of the host lab are estimated at 130 €/year. Costs will be covered by internal lab fundings. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). All generated data will be retained for at least 10 years after the end of the project by the IT department of the host institution. Moreover, the data will be publicly available and should therefore be assessable for re-usage with no time limitation. Detailed documentation will be kept in secure storage. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? All the generated data will be stored and archived on the \"large storage network L-drive\" - KU Leuven LUNA, centrally managed by the central computer, IT department of KU Leuven. All data is backed-up daily to the cloud-storage to ensure safe storage. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Yearly storage costs of 1TB data on large storage servers of the host lab are estimated at 130 €/year. Costs will be covered by internal lab fundings.
