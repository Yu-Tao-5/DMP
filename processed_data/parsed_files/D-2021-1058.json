Legal and ethical issues Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for Research and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). Be aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation. Yes Privacy Registry Reference: Toetsing Pivacy en Ethiek G-2021-4346 Short description of the kind of personal data that will be used: After signing the Informed Consent Form, following demographics and prognostic variables are collected: age (through interview), body height (stadiometer), physical activity level (through IPAQ) (only for aim 2), signs of chronic venous insufficiency (through inspection), co-morbidities (through self-developed co-morbidity questionnaire, based onIDEWE questionnaire).Only for aim 2: Demographics that are additionally collected: physical activity level (through IPAQ). At 6 weeks, information regarding the stage of the urogenital/gynaecological/ skincancer is collected. At 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months cancer treatment characteristics are collected (i.e. type of surgery,number and region of lymph nodes removed, number of positive lymph nodes, adjuvant therapies; by exploring the patient’s medical file). Also, in the ICF is asked for permission to use following data: Familienaam Ja / Nee Voornaam Ja / Nee Adres Ja / Nee Telefoonnummer: ..........................................................

If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant ethical review committee(s) Yes Approval of EC Research UZ Leuven/KU Leuven was granted on 11/01/2022. Does your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted? No Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place? No 4. Documentation and metadata This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 10 of 13 What documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this project? Data will be stored on RedCap and in the patient's medical file of the hospital information system (KWS) . These data can be requested by official bodies/organisations. The progress of data collection, and final report, will be provided to the FWO and the ethics committee (UZ/KU Leuven). Survey data: Metadata (e.g. timestamp, electronic instructions) are automatically captured during survey completion in RedCap. Using RedCap, a Data Dictionary Codebook will be generated containing variable-level information for all captured information: Variable / Field name, Field Label (including question text) and Field Attributes (including Field Type, Validation, Choices, Calculations etc.) Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used. If no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse. No Using RedCap, a Data Dictionary Codebook will be generated containing variable-level information for all captured information: Variable / Field name, Field Label (including question text) and Field Attributes (including Field Type, Validation, Choices, Calculations etc.) 5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project Where will the data be stored? The paper (source) documents will be stored in the office of the PI, in an closet/drawer only accessible for the PI. The data will be stored on the University's central servers with automatic daily back-up procedures: Secured networkdrive KU Leuven (for example. I- / J-schijf) OneDrive linked to a KU Leuven-account REDCap: REDCap is hosted on dedicated KU Leuven data servers at Campus Heverlee Formasa form in the medical file of the patient in the hospital information system (KWS) or by taking pictures of the original source documents and upload them in the patient's medical file in KWS. How is backup of the data provided? The data will be stored on the University's central servers with automatic daily back-up procedures. REDCap: data is backed up as follows: The web server backup regime is specified below: An hourly backup, the last 6 versions of which are saved A daily backup, the last 7 versions of which are saved A weekly backup, the last 6 versions of which are saved The database backup regime is specified below: -A nightly cold backup of all databases- One month’s storage of the nightly cold backups Formasa form (or pictures of the source documents uploaded) in the medical file of the patient (hospital information system KWS) Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes The university and department infrastructure is able to provide sufficient capacity. What are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 11 of 13 will these costs be covered? The expected total volume of data will not require a budget for data storage or preservation. The university and department infrastructure is able to provide sufficient capacity. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The data will be stored at the university's secure enviroment for private data. 6. Data preservation after the FWO project Which data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...). Pseudonomyzed data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for 25 years, conform the policy of EC Research UZ Leuven/KULeuven . Where will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)? The data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures) What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered? no additional costs 7. Data sharing and reuse Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? No Which data will be made available after the end of the project? Data are only accessible on specific requests and after signing a formal agreement. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? In an Open Access repository In a restricted access repository Upon request by mail Publications will be uploaded in a restricted Open Access repository after publication (Lirias). After 12 months, Lirias automatically will change in an Oped Access repository for these publications. When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results Upon request by mail. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? Everybody with a specific request, and after formal approval of the researcher. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered? none 8. Responsibilities Who will be responsible for data documentation & metadata? Tessa De Vrieze (PI) Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project? The Principal Investigator Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ? This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 12 of 13 The Principal Investigator Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP? The PI bears the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP. This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 13 of 13"
