While they can enhance efficiency,\nthese systems also raise concerns, not only as regards their impact on individuals, but also as regards their impact on societal interests such as the rule\nof law. When not accompanied by adequate oversight and accountability mechanisms – especially if developed by private actors or by the executive\npower – judicial AI can hamper core rule of law-principles such as judicial independence and the separation of powers. These concerns arise in a\ncontext that is already marked by an EU ‘rule of law crisis', with some Member States showcasing increased authoritarian tendencies and a capture of\nthe judiciary. Strikingly, neither legal scholars nor EU policymakers are currently linking the ongoing rule of law crisis and the risks raised by judicial\nAI, leading to significant gaps in the conceptual and substantive analysis of the concerns at stake, as well as in the evaluation of the current legal\nframework. This project hence aims to connect these two problems and analyze shortcomings in existing European legislation to counter them.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n15-05-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
