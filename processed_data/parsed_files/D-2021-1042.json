Memristors are a promising class of memory devices in which information is stored and \nextracted as changes in the electrical resistance of a storage medium. So far, the working principle and \npotential of memristors have been illustrated only using readily available ‘off-the-shelf’ materials without \nexploring structure-property relationships. However, to reach the understanding and performance \nrequired for real-world implementation, tailor-made materials are needed. To this end, the MeMOG \nproject will use metal-organic graphene analogues (MOGs), an emerging class of electronicall tuneable \n2D crystalline coordination polymers (CCPs), whose electrical resistance can be reversibly switched by \nseveral orders of magnitude. MOG nanofilms will be prepared with precise control over thickness, \nmorphology, and crystallinity via solvent-free chemical vapour deposition (CVD). In contrast with existing \nsolution-based MOG synthesis protocols that use metal salts and organic solvents, the CVD approach \navoids corrosion and contamination issues and is therefore compatible with microelectronics fabrication. \nThus far, this method has only been used with a limited number of 3D CCPs, MeMOG will adapt the CVD \nmethodology to a wide set of 2D MOGs nanofilms. These MOG layers will be integrated and tested in \nmemristor prototypes for a deeper understanding of their switching mechanism.\nInstitution: KU Leuven\n1. GENERAL INFORMATION\nName applicant\nVíctor Rubio Giménez  \nFWO Project Number & Title\n1263622N Vapour deposition of metal-organic graphene analogues for memory devices (MeMOG)  \nAffiliation\n●KU Leuven\n2. DATA DESCRIPTION\n2Will you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?  \n●Generate new data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. \nThis may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and per WP or objective of the \nproject. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of these data.  Distinguish data types (the \nkind of content) from data formats (the technical format).\nThe expected data volume generated within MeMOG is around 1 GB per month. The details of \nraw and exported data formats are listed below:\nEquipment Raw format Exported formatEstimated volume \n(GB)\nX-ray diffraction XRDML CSV 0.5-1\nSynchrotron X-ray \ndiffractionTIF CSV 100-500\nScanning electron \nmicroscopyTIF or JPEG 1-10\nTransmission electron \nmicroscopyTIF or JPEG 1-5\nInfrared spectroscopy BSP CSV 0.1-0.5\nNuclear magnetic \nresonance spectroscopyFID CSV 0.1-0.5\nX-ray photoelectron \nspectroscopySPE CSV 0.1-0.5\nThermogravimetric \nanalysisNGB-SS3 CSV 0.1-0.5\nMass spectroscopy EXP CSV 0.1-0.5\nUV-Vis spectroscopy SP CSV 0.1-0.5\nAtomic force microscopy SPM PNG 1-10\nElectrical measurements CVS 0.1-0.5\nConfocal microscopy PNG 0.1-0.5\nGas sorption data SMP CSV 0.1-0.5\n3. LEGAL AND ETHICAL ISSUES\n3Will you use personal data?  If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add the \nreference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for Research and Public Service  \nPurposes (PRET application).   Be aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is  \na legal obligation.\n●No\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on \nhumans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant \nethical review committee(s)\n●No\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? \nWill IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions \nwill be asserted? \n●Yes\nIf the proposed concept works, we will work together with KU Leuven tech transfer office to investigate \npatentability. The base technology of the approach is already protected by a granted patent. In case a \npatent application will be filed directly resulting from this project, the related data will not be freely shared \nat least until the patent filing.  \nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If \nso, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\n●No\n4. DOCUMENTATION AND METADATA\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this \nproject?\nAn overview file that contains references to the raw data files will be kept. Regular reports based on the \ndata will be generated using Microsoft Word. PowerPoint files will be used for presentation at regular \ninternal meetings between researchers involved in the project. In both the Word reports and PowerPoint \npresentations, the file names of the raw data files will be included.  \nWill a metadata standard be used? If so,  describe in detail which standard will be used.  If no, \nstate in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse.\n●No\nThe details of each experiment will be kept in an electronic lab notebook. In this notebook, also the \nnames of the raw and processed datafiles will be mentioned. Files will be named according to a pre-\nagreed convention. This working method obviates the need for a separate INFO.txt file in each directory \nyet ensures that the data can be understood by other team members and can be reused in the future.  \n4For published papers, the subset of the raw and processed data discussed in that manuscript will be \ncopied and organized according the paper structure. Likely, this is the data subset that will be most \nfrequently revisited and shared afterwards.  \n5. DATA STORAGE AND BACKUP DURING THE FWO PROJECT\nWhere will the data be stored?  \nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe data on the cloud storage server are automatically backed up. Unlimited versioning is included in the \nselected plan so that accidental erasing or modifying does not pose a risk.  \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will  \nbe taken care of.\n●Yes\nThe total amount of data generated during the project should not exceed a few TB and is therefore \ncompatible with the selected cloud storage solution.  \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these \ncosts be covered? \nThe costs for saving the data to the cloud storage server (including regular backup) should not exceed a \nfew hundred euros. These costs will be covered by the project’ bench fee or by other funding projects \nawarded to the supervisor.  \nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified \nby unauthorized persons?\nThe data generated during the project will be systematically transferred to the cloud storage server. Only \nresearchers involved in this project will have access to the shared folders where the data, reports and \npresentations will be stored.  \n6. DATA PRESERVATION AFTER THE FWO PROJECT\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case \nonly a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or \ncontractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll the generated data will be stored on the cloud storage server for a period of 5 years after the end of \nthe project. \nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\n5All the generated data will be stored on the cloud storage server for a period of 5 years after the end of \nthe project. \nBeyond 5 years after the end of the project, one of the following options will be picked (1) continuation of \nstoring the data on the cloud storage server or (2) transferring the data to the KU Leuven central servers \nfor archiving for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.  \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will  \nthe costs be covered?  \nThe annual cost for long-term storage of the data, either through a cloud storage service or the \nuniversity's central servers, is estimated at a few hundred euro. Since the budget of the current FWO \nproject will no longer be available, creative solutions will have to be found.  \n7. DATA SHARING AND REUSE\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in \nan agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\n●Yes. Specify:\nThe data will remain accessible among the researchers involved in the project. Access to the data can be \ngranted to other persons, upon request and agreement to certain conditions. A patent application can be \na limiting factor in granting access to the data.  \nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nIn case no patent restrictions apply, the written reports and PowerPoint presentations summarizing the \nresults obtained can be made available. The (raw) data used in publications can be made available on a \nrepository, if e.g. requested by the Editors or Publisher of a scientific journal.  \nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\n●Upon request by mail\nThe data that will not have been uploaded in a repository such as 'Scientific data' \n(https://www.nature.com/sdata/) to accompany a publication can be requested via email.  \nWhen will the data be made available?\n●Upon publication of the research results\nDescription of the full scientific method and results will be made available with journal publications.  \nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nUpon request, access to the samples and data can be granted, upon agreement of the project \nresearchers and supervisor. Commercial reuse will not be allowed.  \nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?  \n6Because of the choice for a cloud storage solution for the data, no additional costs will be booked for data  \nsharing. \n8. RESPONSIBILITIES\nWho will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?\nThe principal researcher and supervisor involved in this project will be jointly responsible.  \nWho will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nThe principal researcher and supervisor involved in this project will be jointly responsible. Because of the \nchoice for a cloud storage solution, no additional action is needed for data backup.  \nWho will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ?\nThe principal researcher and supervisor involved in this project will be jointly responsible.  \nWho bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nThe principal researcher bears the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP.
