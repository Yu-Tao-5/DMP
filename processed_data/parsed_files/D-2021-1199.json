If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n \n \n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\n1\n. \nAll microscopy experiments have metadata included into the resulting image file with\nadditional information about the type of experiment, strains, conditions. For time lapse\nexperiments further information about temperature of incubation and specific information of\neach respective recorded position are gathered, if applicable. Generic metadata about i.e.,\ndimensions, image type, bitdepth, pixel sizes and microscope settings are also included.\nExperimental specifications i.e., about sample preparations are reported in handwritten\nnotes in lab journals or digitally in the 'metadata' section of every raw microscopy file.\nDigitalized protocols for individual experimental archetypes are present or will be created\nfor potential later reproduction of results by other individuals.\n2\n. \nGenetic data is either generated or imported into the \"Benchling\" portal, a cloud based\nonline platform and respective metadata is added to the files. Additionally all raw genetic\nsequences are as much as possible annotated to provide detailed information for every\ngenetic construct. Access to data is shared inside the lab, making data internally accessible\neven after a person has left the lab. Additionally, for all primer sequences and all\nconstructed bacterial strains, a comprehensive list will be provided featuring all the\nnecessary information for further use (annealing temperatures, explanation of the primer's\npurpose and the primary template for the primer's table; For the strain's table: Species, full\ngenotype, present plasmid(s), growing conditions, comprehensive notes on the construction\nof the strain, date of construction and location in the -80Â°C freezer). Sequence data itself is\nalways coupled to a genetic sequence in 'Benchling'. The folder containing the raw\nsequence data will be dated and given the same name as its cognate genetic sequence.\n3\n. \nExperimental results and other work documents are readily summarized and/or stored on\nour institute-based cloud \"Onedrive for business\", together with text files describing the\nrespective experimental setup and conditions.\n4\n. \nAll day-to-day research activities are without exception completely described in the non-\ndigital lab-journal which is ordered according to date and type of project so that any\nexperiment and its conditions can be quickly found and checked if needed.\n5\n. \nAny instrument reading (multiplate well reading, HPLC) will be provided with a detailed\ndescription in the instruments software or an accompanying document will be written\ndescribing the conducted experiment with this instrument in detail.\n6\n. \nAll SDS-PAGE/Western blotting gels and microbial culture plate images will be imported in\nPowerpoint so that all lanes/bands on gels and all bacterial strains on the culture plates can\nbe annotated properly. These annotations can additionally be deduced from the non-digital\nlab journal to be found at the date of the experiment mentioned in the name of the\nPowerpoint file.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 6\n \nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nYes\nNo\nFor microscopy data, a metadata model format with fill in fields has been created, so that\nthe blanks can easily be filled in with the respective information. As mentioned before all\nother generic metadata has a standard format in the NIS-elements software and is provided\nfor every microscopic picture taken.\nGenetic data is not described using a general metadata format. A description of any genetic\nsequence/construct is provided and annotations of certain parts of the sequence are given.\nThe list of primers, used to create these genetic sequences, and the strainslist summarising\nstrains equipped with these genetic constructs provide additional information.\nA personal semi-metadata system is used to describe day-to-day research activities in the\nlab journal or in digital summarized experimental results/ work documents: The same type\nof information is always provided when performing a certain experiment. \nAn example:\nFor any PCR that is run, the following information is provided: Type of PCR and\nadditional information if needed for a specific PCR type, Purpose of PCR, Polymerase\nused, primers used, annealing temperature, template used and length of produced\nDNA with elongation time of the PCR.\nFor instrumental readouts, standard metadata formats have already been established\nexplaining the respective numerical outputs.\nAlso for images of SDS-PAGE/Western blotting gels and microbial culture plates, a personal\nsemi-metadata system is used and annotations are made in Powerpoint:\nSDS-PAGE/ Western blotting: Short description of the experiment, every lane and thus\nevery sample that was run on the gel is annotated with sufficient experimental\ninformation, protein ladder with appropriate protein mass, date of experiment,\nimportant bands indicated with an arrow and described next of the image, extra\ninformation on expected protein mass of samples.\nMicrobial culture plates: Short description of the experiment, involved bacterial strains,\ndilution factor, date of experiment.\n \n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nAll research data will be digitalized (except for lab-journals) or has naturally a digital format.\n1. Copies of the research data will be/are stored on a personal computer, 2 external harddrives\n(each residing in a seperate location: one at the applicant's residence and one at the institute's\naddress) and in the cloud (Onedrive for business or the lab Internal network storage (KULeuven))\nin parallel.\n2. Microscopy data is saved on the microscopy computer and immediately copied onto\na personal computer and at least one of the external hard drives. The large volume server of the\nlab Internal network storage (KULeuven) will also be used in parallel to store all microscopy data.\n3. Genetic sequence data is stored in the cloud (Benchling) for easy shared access.\n4. Lab journals are kept in the lab and are stored in an archive once a person has left\nthe lab.\n \nHow is backup of the data provided?\nData is backed up periodically via online cloud storage (Onedrive for business).\nAt regular intervals backups of all data will be created on two large external hard drives (4Tb).\nThis is especially the case for microscopy data which are very large for online clouds. This data\nwill be thus stored at least in twofold to avoid loss of data due to potential failure of one of the\nharddisks. If capacity permits, microscopy data will also be stored in the lab Internal network\nstorage (KULeuven), certainly for the most crucial microscopy data.\nOnce projects or chapters of larger projects are completed, i.e. publication of data, said\ndata will be archived in an internal network.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 6\n \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nTwo personal 4Tb hard drives are used to create regular two-fold backups of all research data,\nespecially regular copies of microscopy data.\nOnedrive for business cloud services provide 2Tb of storage space and is more than sufficient to\nstore all research data except for all of the microscopy data.\nLab Internal network storage can be expanded if needed but still has sufficient capacity.\n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nCa. 100 Euro/year/person for extended storage on backed-up network drives are allocated. This\nis typically covered by the budget for computer equipment.\n \nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nNone of the data are publicly available and no personal data will be generated in the scope of this\nproject making the data less sensitive.\nHowever, all raw data files will only exist on internal networks or hard drives protected\nby passwords, respectively, and thus not be accessible by unauthorized persons.\nThe same goes for all cloud-based data i.e. sequencing data, work documents, etc..\n \n6.
