The biggest financial consequence of urban sprawl\nis the loss of open space, which leads to a groundwater deficit. To remedy this, Flanders has set\nthe goal to zero net land take by 2040. This project will help urban planners by exposing the\neffects on the landscape of current zoning laws at highly detailed parcel level. Concretely,\nmachine learning networks will be developed to detect and segment the physical impact of\nzoning laws from high-resolution imagery. Machine learning networks that are capable of 3D\nobject detection and image segmentation will allow for high-resolution mapping of physical\nimpacts of zoning law changes and help interpret building functions. Change detection\nalgorithms will process this output and compare time frames to identify changes and expose the\nevolution of land use. This involves both multiclass and simultaneous processing of time series.\nThe most novel element of this project is the â€˜meta networkâ€™, which will deduce from a\nlimited number of samples the objects that are indicative of and are the result of a zoning law\nchange. This allows for the dynamic generation of output layers for a given zoning law, which\nillustrate the geographical impact of previous law changes and predict the geographical\nconsequences of new law proposals.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
