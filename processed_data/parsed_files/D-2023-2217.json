However, the mechanisms\nresponsible for VDR-mediated signalling in different tissues remain incompletely understood, potentially because\nprevious studies neglected the transcriptionally repressive effects of the VDR. In the current project, we will therefore\ninvestigate transgenic mouse models in which only transcriptional repression can take place (Vdr-delta-AF2 and\nCyp27b1 knockout mice). This approach allows us not only to answer long-standing questions on the mechanisms of\ntranscriptional repression (Aim 1), but also to gain novel insights in VDR-regulated transcriptional networks.\nNotwithstanding the fact that vitamin D is a major stimulator of intestinal and renal calcium (re)absorption, not all\nproteins involved in this process have been identified. Interestingly, previously performed transcriptome analyses in\nintestine and kidney of Vdr-delta-AF2 mice showed differential regulation of genes that function in mineral\n(re)absorption. We will evaluate whether these transporters are implicated in vitamin D-induced calcium\n(re)absorption (Aim 2). Our transcriptome analysis also revealed\nmultiple differentially regulated genes involved in energy\nhomeostasis, which is interesting in view of the lean phenotype of mice with defective VDR signaling. We will therefore\ninvestigate whether VDR-mediated alterations in intestinal and skeletal nutrient handling contribute to this phenotype\n(Aim3).\nLast modified: \n19-04-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Last modiﬁed 19 April 2023\n3 of 10\nWe do not exclude that the proposed work could result in research data with potential for teach transfer and valorization. The KU Leuven has a policy to actively monitor\nresearch data for such potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of cases the invention will be protected\n(mostly patent application or copyright protection). As such the IP protection does not withhold the research from being made public. In case a decision is taken to file a\npatent application it will be planned so that publications need not be delayed.\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements/ research\ncollaboration agreements)?

Documentation and Metadata\nClearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for\nyourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks,\nREADME.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded).\n1. Cell culture experiments.\nPage-numbered laboratory notebooks will be maintained to document cell line, culture media, experimental treatments, timing and end-point analyses. All data derived\nfrom 1 experiment will be stored in 1 folder of which the name carries at least the name of the used cell type and the date. End-point-specific files will be stored within\nthis folder and file names will include cell type, date, time point, and end-point analysis. The experimental folder will also contain a text file in which the experimental\nprocedure is explained in such detail that it can easily be repeated. Standard experimental procedures (SOPs) and practices will be fully documented (as MS Word and PDF\nfiles) and stored on the J drive\n2. Phenotypic analyses of transgenic mice. \nNotes on breeding and genotyping (protocol & results) are stored in dedicated files on a shared network drive. In-depth phenotyping results will be stored in folders\ncontaining a least the strain name. Within this folder, different end-point analyses will be stored in subfolders of which the name contains at least the name of the\ntransgenic line, animal age and  sex, and the name of the end-point analysis.\n3.

If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which\nmetadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data\neasier to find and reuse.\nYes\nSequencing data types require particular metadata, such as data submitted to EGA, GEO,\nSRA, ArrayExpress, or ENA. Local data that is not (yet) submitted to these resources will\nbe based on generalized metadata schema such as Dublin Core or DataCite, including\nthe following elements:\nTitle: free text\nCreator: Last name, first name, organization\nDate and time reference\nSubject: Choice of keywords and classifications\nDescription: Text explaining the content of the data set and other contextual\ninformation needed for the correct interpretation of the data, the software(s)\n(including version number) used to produce and to read the data, the purpose of the\nexperiment, etc.\nFormat: Details of the file format,\nResource Type: data set, image, audio, etc.\nIdentifier: DOI (when applicable)Access rights: closed access, embargoed access, restricted access, open access.\nWhen depositing data in a local or public repository, the final dataset will be accompanied\nby this information under the form of a README.txt document. This file will be located in\nthe top level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and\noutline the file-naming convention used (see section 7 below). This will allow the data to\nbe understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset\nfor future reuse.\nFurther, we will store metadata from experiments in a searchable database format. These\nwill include the following search parameters: date, investigator name, type of study, and\nstrain name in case of animal studies.\n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nDigital files will be stored on KU Leuven servers:\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 19 April 2023\n4 of 10\nOmics data: omics data generated during the project will either be stored on KU\nLeuven servers.\nOther data files (digital images, μCT data, equipment-generated data) will be stored\non local KU Leuven servers and PI computers. Large data volumes will be back-up\nat local hard disks.\nPaper lab notebooks will be kept in lockable closets in the lab of the PI.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nKU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme:\nData stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all\nincremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14\nbackups are kept.\nData stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and\nweekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups\nare kept.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThere is sufficient storage and back-up capacity on all KU Leuven servers:\nThe “L-drive” is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System\n(GPFS) cluster with NetApp eseries storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in\nthe front-end.\nThe “J-drive” is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controlers with an Ontap\n9.1P9 operating system.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nFor digital files: all data will be stored at the university's secure environment and access to\nthese sites is password-protected.\nFor paper notebooks and experimental samples: will be stored within the laboratory and office rooms, which will be inaccessible after office hours.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nThe total estimated cost of data storage during the project is €2000. This estimation is\nbased on the following costs: The costs of digital data storage are as follows:\nOne drive (2 TB): free\nJ-drive: €519/TB/Y\nK-drive: €56.9/TB/Y\nL-drive: €284.6/TB/Y\nThe costs will be covered by internal funding.\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the\nproject? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues,\ninstitutional policies...).\nIn accordance to the KU Leuven policy we will retain all data for at least 5 years after the\nend of the research project, after the publication data, or after the end of a PhD\ndissertation.\nFor biological samples, it is not always feasible to store the samples for a time frame of 5\nyears as sample quality deteriorates over time.\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nDigital data will be stored at KU Leuven's archive (K:\\) and large vulume storages (L:\\)\ndrives. Team and personal hard disks will provide local back-up and will be stored in\nlockable closets within the laboratory of the PI.\nPaper lab notebooks and experimental samples will be stored within the laboratory of the\nPI.\nManuscripts will be deposited in KU Leuven repository (LIRIAS).\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nThe total estimated cost of data storage during the 5 years after the end of the FWO project is €1000. This estimation is based on €70/Tb/Y.\nThe costs will be covered by internal funding.\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 19 April 2023\n5 of 10\n5. Data sharing and reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type\nwhich data will be made available.\nYes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …)\nYes, in an Open Access repository\nThe PI in the present project is committed to publish research results to communicate them to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications\nwill be made openly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers\nand/or potential new collaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. negative data).\nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.\nData could be reused by other members of the CEE team, after consultation and approval of the head of the research team (Prof A. Verstuyf).\nData can be made accessible to a third party after signing a data sharing agreement and approval of the head of the research team (Prof A. Verstuyf). An appropriate DTA\nand/or MTA will be put in place. Access will be considered after a request is submitted explaining the planned reuse. Only uses for research purposes will be allowed and\ncommercial reuse will be excluded. Exceptions are to be submitted to the head of the research team (Prof A Verstuyf).\nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nPlease explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nNo\nWhere will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.\nSharing policies for specific research outputs are detailed below:\nOmics datasets will be deposited in open access repositories such as the EMBL-EBI\nplatform for genomics and epigenomics data, or the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the EBI ArrayExpress databases for functional genomics data or\nthe EBI European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) for personally identifiable\ngenetic and phenotypic data.\nOther digital datasets that support publications (including image, μCT data) will be\nmade publicly available via an open research data platform such as Mendeley Data\nor Zenodo.\nResearch documentation: All protocols used to generate published data will be\ndescribed in the corresponding manuscript(s), and the related documentation will be\nincluded as supplementary information.\nManuscripts: Publications will be automatically added to our institutional repository,\nLirias 2.0, based on the authors name and ORCID ID (the metadata will be added,\nnot the full manuscripts).\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nAs a general rule all research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at the\ntime of publication. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending\npublications, potential IP requirements.\nWhich data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why.\nData usage licenses will be discussed with LRD before any licenses are granted. Similarly, when DTAs or MTAs are discussed, this will always be after consulting and\ncollaborating with LRD.\nDo you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section.\nYes\nDepending on the data repository and the type of data that would be made available, a unique identifier will be added to the data set.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nIt is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard\nprocedures (internally generated operational procedures (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_operating_procedure)) e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and\norganization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be\ncovered by internal funding.\nIf shipment of data or material is required, the costs will be covered by the researcher requesting the materials after DTAs and/or MTAs are put in place.\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

However, the mechanisms responsible for VDR-mediated signalling in different tissues remain incompletely understood, potentially because previous studies neglected the transcriptionally repressive effects of the VDR. In the current project, we will therefore investigate transgenic mouse models in which only transcriptional repression can take place (Vdr-delta-AF2 and Cyp27b1 knockout mice). This approach allows us not only to answer long-standing questions on the mechanisms of transcriptional repression (Aim 1), but also to gain novel insights in VDR-regulated transcriptional networks. Notwithstanding the fact that vitamin D is a major stimulator of intestinal and renal calcium (re)absorption, not all proteins involved in this process have been identified. Interestingly, previously performed transcriptome analyses in intestine and kidney of Vdr-delta-AF2 mice showed differential regulation of genes that function in mineral (re)absorption. We will evaluate whether these transporters are implicated in vitamin D-induced calcium (re)absorption (Aim 2). Our transcriptome analysis also revealed multiple differentially regulated genes involved in energy homeostasis, which is interesting in view of the lean phenotype of mice with defective VDR signaling. We will therefore investigate whether VDR-mediated alterations in intestinal and skeletal nutrient handling contribute to this phenotype (Aim3). Last modified: 19-04-2023 Created using DMPonline.be.

Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? Describe these issues in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. Yes, animal data Yes, animal data. Ethics approval will be obtained from the Ethical Committee for Animal Experimentation. Will you process personal data? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. No Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 19 April 2023 3 of 10 We do not exclude that the proposed work could result in research data with potential for teach transfer and valorization. The KU Leuven has a policy to actively monitor research data for such potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of cases the invention will be protected (mostly patent application or copyright protection). As such the IP protection does not withhold the research from being made public. In case a decision is taken to file a patent application it will be planned so that publications need not be delayed. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements/ research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. No Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. No 2. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). 1. Cell culture experiments. Page-numbered laboratory notebooks will be maintained to document cell line, culture media, experimental treatments, timing and end-point analyses. All data derived from 1 experiment will be stored in 1 folder of which the name carries at least the name of the used cell type and the date. End-point-specific files will be stored within this folder and file names will include cell type, date, time point, and end-point analysis. The experimental folder will also contain a text file in which the experimental procedure is explained in such detail that it can easily be repeated. Standard experimental procedures (SOPs) and practices will be fully documented (as MS Word and PDF files) and stored on the J drive 2. Phenotypic analyses of transgenic mice. Notes on breeding and genotyping (protocol & results) are stored in dedicated files on a shared network drive. In-depth phenotyping results will be stored in folders containing a least the strain name. Within this folder, different end-point analyses will be stored in subfolders of which the name contains at least the name of the transgenic line, animal age and sex, and the name of the end-point analysis. 3. All experimental RNA and cDNA samples are catalogued in dedicated MS Excel files, which will contain information on the physical storage of all samples. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. Yes Sequencing data types require particular metadata, such as data submitted to EGA, GEO, SRA, ArrayExpress, or ENA. Local data that is not (yet) submitted to these resources will be based on generalized metadata schema such as Dublin Core or DataCite, including the following elements: Title: free text Creator: Last name, first name, organization Date and time reference Subject: Choice of keywords and classifications Description: Text explaining the content of the data set and other contextual information needed for the correct interpretation of the data, the software(s) (including version number) used to produce and to read the data, the purpose of the experiment, etc. Format: Details of the file format, Resource Type: data set, image, audio, etc. Identifier: DOI (when applicable)Access rights: closed access, embargoed access, restricted access, open access. When depositing data in a local or public repository, the final dataset will be accompanied by this information under the form of a README.txt document. This file will be located in the top level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used (see section 7 below). This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse. Further, we will store metadata from experiments in a searchable database format. These will include the following search parameters: date, investigator name, type of study, and strain name in case of animal studies. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Digital files will be stored on KU Leuven servers: Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 19 April 2023 4 of 10 Omics data: omics data generated during the project will either be stored on KU Leuven servers. Other data files (digital images, μCT data, equipment-generated data) will be stored on local KU Leuven servers and PI computers. Large data volumes will be back-up at local hard disks. Paper lab notebooks will be kept in lockable closets in the lab of the PI. How will the data be backed up? KU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme: Data stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept. Data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes There is sufficient storage and back-up capacity on all KU Leuven servers: The “L-drive” is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster with NetApp eseries storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front-end. The “J-drive” is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controlers with an Ontap 9.1P9 operating system. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? For digital files: all data will be stored at the university's secure environment and access to these sites is password-protected. For paper notebooks and experimental samples: will be stored within the laboratory and office rooms, which will be inaccessible after office hours. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The total estimated cost of data storage during the project is €2000. This estimation is based on the following costs: The costs of digital data storage are as follows: One drive (2 TB): free J-drive: €519/TB/Y K-drive: €56.9/TB/Y L-drive: €284.6/TB/Y The costs will be covered by internal funding. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). In accordance to the KU Leuven policy we will retain all data for at least 5 years after the end of the research project, after the publication data, or after the end of a PhD dissertation. For biological samples, it is not always feasible to store the samples for a time frame of 5 years as sample quality deteriorates over time. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Digital data will be stored at KU Leuven's archive (K:\\) and large vulume storages (L:\\) drives. Team and personal hard disks will provide local back-up and will be stored in lockable closets within the laboratory of the PI. Paper lab notebooks and experimental samples will be stored within the laboratory of the PI. Manuscripts will be deposited in KU Leuven repository (LIRIAS). What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The total estimated cost of data storage during the 5 years after the end of the FWO project is €1000. This estimation is based on €70/Tb/Y. The costs will be covered by internal funding.

In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) Yes, in an Open Access repository The PI in the present project is committed to publish research results to communicate them to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made openly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new collaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. negative data). If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Data could be reused by other members of the CEE team, after consultation and approval of the head of the research team (Prof A. Verstuyf). Data can be made accessible to a third party after signing a data sharing agreement and approval of the head of the research team (Prof A. Verstuyf). An appropriate DTA and/or MTA will be put in place. Access will be considered after a request is submitted explaining the planned reuse. Only uses for research purposes will be allowed and commercial reuse will be excluded. Exceptions are to be submitted to the head of the research team (Prof A Verstuyf). Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. No Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. Sharing policies for specific research outputs are detailed below: Omics datasets will be deposited in open access repositories such as the EMBL-EBI platform for genomics and epigenomics data, or the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the EBI ArrayExpress databases for functional genomics data or the EBI European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) for personally identifiable genetic and phenotypic data. Other digital datasets that support publications (including image, μCT data) will be made publicly available via an open research data platform such as Mendeley Data or Zenodo. Research documentation: All protocols used to generate published data will be described in the corresponding manuscript(s), and the related documentation will be included as supplementary information. Manuscripts: Publications will be automatically added to our institutional repository, Lirias 2.0, based on the authors name and ORCID ID (the metadata will be added, not the full manuscripts). When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results As a general rule all research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at the time of publication. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, potential IP requirements. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. Data usage licenses will be discussed with LRD before any licenses are granted. Similarly, when DTAs or MTAs are discussed, this will always be after consulting and collaborating with LRD. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. Yes Depending on the data repository and the type of data that would be made available, a unique identifier will be added to the data set. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures (internally generated operational procedures (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_operating_procedure)) e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by internal funding. If shipment of data or material is required, the costs will be covered by the researcher requesting the materials after DTAs and/or MTAs are put in place. Created using DMPonline.be.
