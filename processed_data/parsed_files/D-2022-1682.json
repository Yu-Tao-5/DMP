A recently emerging trend is the use of more than one\nmaterial in a single production run. This is mainly driven by the industrial demand to add more\nfunctionalities and hence more value in the produced parts to offset the relatively high (additive)\nmanufacturing costs. Especially in powder-based manufacturing routes, such as those studied\nby the applicants, multi-material manufacturing machines are complex to design and control,\nand powder recyclability is typically low. This is currently limiting the industrial uptake of multi-\nmaterial powder manufacturing routes. With this C3 project, the applicants aim to overcome this\nby implementing a new and commercially available powder deposition system for three different\ntypes of material combinations into their unique in-house developed manufacturing machines.\nThis should enable the fabrication of multi-material benchmark parts. The resulting insights and\ndemonstrator should allow patent exploration and continued research with (inter)national\nindustrial partners that have already confirmed interest in this work.\n \nLast modified: \n03-01-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
