If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes Investigating the design of novel radiopharmaceuticals for potential cancer treatment holds significant promise for commercial valorization. While the outcomes of research endeavours are inherently uncertain, the pursuit of innovative solutions in oncology presents opportunities for various forms of commercial exploitation, including but not limited to technology transfer, spin-offs, and eventual commercialization. To aid this, we work in close collaboration with the unit Intellectuele Eigendom at KU Leuven before we disseminate any data and we are also working on the design of possible radiopharmaceuticals that could be patented. As such, the confidentiality of this project is closely guarded. The data is not shared outside the collaboration with the ICMATE group and all participants have signed a non-disclosure agreement. The results will not be presented or published until the decision is made with regards to future valorization.

Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). Our laboratory is subscribed [currently for 3 years with a definite extension] to the Labguru online electronic laboratory notebook service. This service allows for the clear documentation of all the procedures followed, the creation of standard protocols, attaching all the result files per experiment and also providing inventory capabilities to ensure that physical samples are recorded properly. The Labguru electronic software allow for all data to be findable easily by using the filtering function as well as accessible to the whole lab to reuse the data and also follow the protocols. Although LabGuru does allow the sharing of information with collaborators, our group has decided to only share data in-house for members of the Laboratory for Radiopharmaceutical Research. Except for animal in vivo scanning data (PET, SPECT and CT data), all the data will be linked into LabGuru to the experiments and protocols used to generate the data. This will be done in at least PDF format or similar reports as it is not always easy to link the raw data to LabGuru. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data?

Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? All the data for experiments, protocols and results as well as the final analysed data will be stored on LabGuru. This is a yearly subscription service that is paid for by the internal funds of the Laboratory for Radiopharmaceutical Research. The storage is envisioned to at least outlast the required 5-year storage mandate requested. Raw data for the analysis (HPLC data, LC/MS data, NMR data and imaging data) are stored on the KU Leuven G drive and backed up to the KU Leuven K Drive every 6 months. The Incucyte system has 16.4 TB storage capacity and has 4 hard drives. The data is stored in RAID format and is duplicated across different hard drives. Routine data backup is also performed.

In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). institutional policies...). All data will be stored for 7 -10 years. This is because the data gathered will also be used for product development and valorization should a feasible product be developed during the research. However, tissue samples and chemical library samples will only be tested for the shelf-life of individual samples. Chemical library samples are where a small test amount is kept in a -80 degree freezer should additional analysis be necessary. In this case, the sample will be tested at a predefined retest date (e.g. 12 months). If the sample is no longer intact, it will be discarded. Tissue samples will be kept for a maximum of 5 years. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? The responsibility of long term storage will be undertaken by Prof Frederik Cleeren and this will be stored on the servers of KU Leuven with access provided to the entire research group with permission of Prof Cleeren.
