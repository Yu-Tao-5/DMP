Although various adaptive workplace technologies \naim to manage these risks, their individual and joint impact on worker health and well-being  \nis still unclear. The EU-funded SONATA project therefore aims to generate evidence-based  \nrecommendations on how architectural adaptation can benefit human health and well-being  \nin various hybrid workplace contexts. The project will measure, quantify, and expand the \nrange of health and wellbeing benefits of architectural adaptation, generate empirical \nknowledge on how multiple adaptations should be combined to maximise their benefits, \nand ensure that these benefits are distributed in an equitable way among the workers in a \nshared workplace.  \n1.2.Purpose of the deliverable\nThis deliverable presents the first version of the SONATA Data Management Plan (DMP)  \nand describes:\nThe guiding principles for data management in the project.\nThe legal framework constituted by the General Data Protection Directive (GDPR).\nThe data summary, which gives an overview of what data will be gathered and \nprocessed by SONATA, i.e. categories, contents, formats, volumes.\nThe strategies of how data will be processed in line with the FAIR principles (finable,  \naccessible, interoperable, and reusable).\nThe guidelines to assure data security.\nA summary of ethics and privacy strategies regarding SONATA data processing.\nThe main purpose of the DMP is to ensure good data handling throughout the project, \nespecially providing guidelines on which SONATA data can be shared with the public and \nhow to make them available. The DMP is a living document and will be updated periodically  \nto reflect the actual research data generated during the project, together with updated \ninstructions for how to access open data.\n1.3.Intended audience\nThe dissemination level of D1.2 is ‘ sensitive’ (SEN) and it is available to the members of the \nConsortium and the European Commission (EC) services. This document is primarily \nintended to serve as an internal guideline and reference for all SONATA beneficiaries, \nespecially the governance bodies such as the General Assembly, the Steering Committee, \nthe Industry Steering Board, and the Work Package Leaders.\n2.Guiding principles\nThe guiding principle of the SONATA project is to be as scientifically open as possible, with \n87 out of its 121 deliverables being publicly available. Of the 34 that are not public, 24 are \nadministrative plans and reports, and the remaining 10 are technological prototypes.\nThe handling of SONATA data will conform to the provisions set forth in: a) the GDPR \n(Regulation (EU) 2016/679),  b) the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the \nConvention 108 for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to Automatic Processing of \nPersonal Data, and c) national laws applicable to the acquisition of valid consent.\n4\nD1.2 – SONATA\nThis project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.As of April 2024, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is applicable in all Member  \nStates in the European Union, as well as in the countries in the European Economic Area \n(EEA). GDPR updates and modernises existing laws on data protection to strengthen \ncitizens' fundamental rights and guarantee their privacy in the digital age. GDPR regulates \nthe processing by an individual, a company or an organisation of personal data relating to \nindividuals in the EU. GDPR grant individuals a set of rights that must be protected by any \nactor who processes personal data. SONATA will ensure that its stakeholders assume \nthe highest level of GDPR individual rights .\nRelated documents referenced as the guiding principle for SONATA DMP:\n[1] Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016  \non the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on \nthe free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection  \nRegulation) https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?\nuri=CELEX%3A32016R0679&qid=1713190901660\n[2] Horizon Europe Ethics and data protection: \nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/\nguidance/ethics-and-data-protection_he_en.pdf  \n[3] Guidelines on data protection impact assessment (DPIA) and determining whether \nprocessing is ‘likely to result in a high risk’ for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679 (last \nrevised and adopted 4 October 2017): https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/just/document.cfm?\ndoc_id=47711\n[4] 2011/61/EU: Commission Decision of 31  January 2011 pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC \nof the European Parliament and of the Council on the adequate protection of personal data \nby the State of Israel with regard to automated processing of personal data (notified under \ndocument C(2011) 332) Text with EEA relevance: \nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32011D0061\n[5] Report on the first review of the functioning of the adequacy decisions adopted pursuant  \nto Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC:  https://commission.europa.eu/document/f62d70a4-\n39e3-4372-9d49-e59dc0fda3df_en  \n2.1.Key concept definitions\nThis section provides the definitions of key concepts in this document.\nPersonal data categories:\nPersonal data includes ‘any information relating to an identified or identifiable \nnatural person’. An ‘identifiable natural person ’, or ‘data subject’, is ‘one who can be \nidentified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an \nidentification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to \nthe physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that \nnatural person’ [1].\nSpecial categories of personal data  (formerly known as ‘ sensitive data’) are \nsubject to more stringent data-protection safeguards. They include ‘ personal data revealing  \nracial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union \nmembership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely  \nidentifying a natural person, data concerning health  or data concerning a natural person's \nsex life or sexual orientation ’ [1].\n5\nD1.2 – SONATA\nThis project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.Data processing concepts:\nData processing includes ‘any operation or set of operations which is performed on  \npersonal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means , such as \ncollection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, \nconsultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, \nalignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction ’ [1].\nPseudonymisation entails substituting personally identifiable information (such as \nan individual’s name) with a unique identifier that is not connected to their real-world \nidentity, using techniques such as coding or hashing. However, if it is possible to re-identify  \nthe individual data subjects by reversing the pseudonymisation process, data protection \nobligations still apply. They cease to apply only when the data are fully and irreversibly \nanonymised [2].\nAnonymisation involves techniques that can be used to convert personal data into \nfully and irreversibly  anonymised data [2].\nRe-identification is the process of turning pseudonymised or anonymised data \nback into personal data by means of data matching or similar techniques.\nRoles and responsibilities:\nA Data Controller is who ‘alone, or jointly with others, determines the purposes and  \nmeans of the processing of personal data ’ [2].\nA Data Processor is who ‘processes personal data on behalf of the controller ’ [2].\nAlthough fully and irreversibly anonymised data are no longer considered personal \ndata [2], anonymisation processes are challenging, particularly where large datasets \ncontaining a wide range of personal data are concerned.  \n2.2.Roles and responsibilities\nOnly six SONATA partners assume the role of Data Controllers, who directly collects \npersonal data from data subjects, including study participants and external stakeholders, \nincluding:\nFour partners responsible for conducting intervention evaluation studies, who will \ncollect personal data from study participants:\noSituational track (ST): UNIPG (Italy).\noOrchestration track (OT): UKA (Germany).\noSocio-cultural track (CT): IRIUL (Slovenia).\noField track (FT): KUL (Belgium).\nTwo partners responsible for the recommendation validation workshops, as well as \ndissemination, exploitation and communication activities, who will collect personal \ncontact details of external stakeholders :\noRecommendation track (RT): MUNI (Czechia).\noDissemination track (DT):  EVALT (Italy).\nThe Data Controllers are responsible to ensure that their data processing is in line with (1) \nthe Horizon Europe GDPR principles, (2) the EU and national data protectional laws, as well \nas (3) the ethical requirements from their respective countries and institutions. They are also  \nresponsible to pseudonymise or anonymise  the data appropriately, and securely store \nthe raw data as well as any re-identification keys as outlined in 6.

A summary of this \nagreement, as well as a single point of contact of the Data Controller, will be provided to \nthe respective data subjects. Together with the Data Controllers, the Data Manager, who \nis also the Project Coordinator  (Andrew Vande Moere, KUL) and the Project Manager \n(Alex Binh Vinh Duc Nguyen, KUL) are responsible in monitoring the generation and \nexecution of these agreements.\nSONATA will actively involve the Data Protection Officers (DPOs)  appointed by its partner  \ninstitutions, as well as its External Ethics Advisor  (Petr Jemelka, MUNI), to seek for their \nadvises in data processing, privacy, or protection issues. The contact details of the DPOs at  \nthe time of writing this deliverable are:\nKUL: Toon Boon (toon.boon@kuleuven.be ) via KU Leuven GDPR helpdesk .\nUNIPG: xxx\nIRIUL: xxx\nUKA: xxx\nTECH: xxx\nMUNI: xxx\nAny other?\nFor each intervention study, all personal data will only be collected upon receiving \ninformed consent  from the participants, and any participant providing personal data can at  \nany time withdraw their participation and related data from the project. The privacy, ethics, \nand procedures for obtaining informed consent are described in detail in Deliverable 1.8. \nEthics management plan  (Month 6), and a short summary is provided in 7. Ethics.\n7\nD1.2 – SONATA\nThis project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.3.Data summary\nSONATA does not consider to re-use any existing data; and will only collect or process \ndata after receiving the explicit consent from data subjects.\n3.1.Purpose of data generation\nData generation is crucial for SONATA to achieve its three Key Objectives:\nKO.1: To realise architectural adaptation as a negotiating link between the health- and \nwellbeing risks and benefits that exist in the workplace, and their physical and mental \nhealth outcomes, which can be positively enforced through the purposeful intervention of \nmulti-layered, situational-aware, orchestrated and equitable workplace design principles.\nTo accomplish KO.1, SONATA needs to gather sufficient data to develop and \nevaluate a situational-aware digital twin  able to estimate actual workplace situations by \nmeans of fusing automated (quantitative) data about environmental conditions, human \noccupancy, the positions of assets and wider-scale activities of workers; and voluntary \n(qualitative) data about individual work activities and preferences. This digital twin then \ninforms an orchestration model  able to optimise the holistic health and wellbeing effect of \nconcurrent adaptations on different layers to be more beneficial than the combination of \neach individual layer separately. To ensure equitable individualised adaptation, a human-\nbuilding interface (HBI)  will allow workers to provide (anonymous) feedback to \ncommunicate individual preferences, change mis-estimated situations or fine-tune \nadaptations to their liking.\nKO.2: To define the principles of an evaluation methodology that is based on objective and \nsubjective short-term health and wellbeing indicators, which can capture the influence of \narchitectural adaptation in the shared workplace to estimate the benefits and risks for \nlonger-term health and wellbeing of individuals.\nTo accomplish KO.2, SONATA needs to first evaluate the most relevant health \nand wellbeing benefits and risks  for prototypical shared workplaces via a thorough \nliterature review, qualitative observations and interviews with actual workers, and interviews  \nand focus groups with SONATA’s key target group representatives.  To measure the health  \nand wellbeing impact of architectural adaptation , SONATA needs to implement \nintervention evaluation studies through both short-term controlled experiments and longer-\nterm longitudinal experiments, in which the health and wellbeing impact will be quantified \nthrough both objective and subjective measures such as environmental, behavioural (e.g., \nactigraphy) and physiological data collection and processing, and via pre- and post-\nintervention surveys; and also qualitatively assessed  through ethnography-informed \nresearch methods (e.g. observation, in-depth interviews).\nKO.3: To create evidence-based recommendations and guidelines that facilitate the \neffective application of architectural adaptation for workers, work organisation innovators, \narchitectural designers, OSH experts, building certificate and rating consultants and \nadaptive technology manufacturers.\nTo accomplish KO.3, SONATA needs to first synthesise its results into a unified \nrecommendation binders  with sufficient evidence (e.g. measurement, data log, literature). \nThese recommendations will be validated internally  through cost/benefit, sustainability, \nand barriers to implementation analysis, and participatory workshop with key target group \nrepresentative; before being externally disseminated  to a wide audience of at least four \ndifferent target groups: individuals, organisations, policymakers, and industry professionals;  \n8\nD1.2 – SONATA\nThis project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.who will be invited by SONATA partners from their respective networks. Therefore, \ncollecting contact details of these external stakeholders is crucial.\n3.2.Data categories\nFigure 1 illustrates the four main data categories collected and generated by SONATA, \nincluding: technical data, research data, research results, and administrative data. The \ndefinitions of these data categories are as below:\nTechnical data: all data related to the implementation and operation of the \nSONATA architectural adaptation technologies (hardware and software), which is \ncomprised of their source code, schematic design, and their (raw) digital logs.\nResearch data: all data streams from the SONATA research tracks that benchmark \nindividual health and wellbeing impact of adaptation technologies, and then valorise \nthese knowledges into validated recommendations. Within research data, raw non-\nanonymised and pseudonymised data are personal data.\nResearch results: all processed data that are presented in publications, \ndeliverables, recommendations, output technologies, and business models. \nProtected research results will feed into patents and licenses following the IP policy,  \nwhile non-protected results will be made openly accessible as early as possible to \ncomply with Horizon Europe guidelines for Open Science practices.  \nAdministrative data:  all (confidential) data that is generated or shared internally \nwithin the SONATA Consortium for administrative and management purposes. \nWithin these data, the contact information of external stakeholders collected from \nConsortium partners is personal data.\n \nFigure 1. The flow of the four SONATA data categories\n3.3.Data generation methodology\nTable 2 lists the different data generation approaches that SONATA will employ, resulting  \nfrom a Consortium-wide survey conducted in Month 5 of the Project implementation.\nTable 2.

for generating, processing, and \noverseeing the sharing of research data within the Consortium.\n3.5.3.Research results\nResearch results include all processed data that are presented in publications, deliverables,  \nrecommendations, output technologies, business models, and FAIR dataset collections. \n13\nD1.2 – SONATA\nThis project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.Specifically, SONATA aims to publish three collections of FAIR datasets  in the public \ndomain at the end of the project. These datasets include:\n1.FAIRD1. Research data  : the quantitative and qualitative data streams synthesised \nfrom the intervention evaluation studies that are already irreversibly anonymised.\n2.FAIRD2. Research results  : the processed and analysed research data that inform \nany SONATA scientific claim or conclusion, disseminated in the form of scientific \npublications, numerical data, texts, images, tables, and other relevant formats.\n3.FAIRD3. Technical data  : the generated source code that facilitate the final \nprototypes of the adaptive technologies - if the IP measures allows.\nThe publication of the three FAIR datasets will be reported in D1.4. FAIR dataset \npublication 1 (KUL, deadline M24), and D1.5. FAIR dataset publication 2  (KUL, deadline \nM48).\nThe selection of specific data to be included in each FAIR dataset will be processed by the \nfollowing parties:\nThe SONATA Data Manager  (Andrew Vande Moere, KUL), who will propose the \noverall structure of each FAIR dataset.\nThe relevant Research Data Controllers  (for FAIRD1 and FAIRD2) and Technical \nData Controllers (for FAIRD3), as detailed in Table 4 and Table 5, who will feed \ntheir collected or generated data into the dataset structure at their own initiatives.\nThe Ethics, Gender & Diversity Manager (Tomáš Ondráček, MUNI), who will \nperform screenings for privacy and ethics issues in these datasets if requested by \nconcerning partner.\nThe IP Manager (Marc Hoppermann, BLDG), who will inform the Data Controllers \nand mediate between relevant partners in case any protected data should not be \nincluded in the FAIR datasets.\nAs shown in Figure 1, protected research results will feed into patents and licenses \nfollowing the SONATA IP policy ( Deliverable 1.10. IP strategy plan  - Month 24), while \nnon-protected results will be made openly accessible as early as possible to comply with \nHorizon Europe guidelines for Open Science practices, following the FAIR data strategies  \nas outlines in section 4. FAIR data.\n3.5.4.Administrative data\nAdministrative data includes all (confidential) data that is generated or shared internally \nwithin the SONATA Consortium for administration and management, such as meeting \nminutes, recordings, internal reports, etc., for historical purposes and future follow-up; as \nwell as contact information of external stakeholders collected from Consortium partners.  \nIn the case of contact information of external stakeholders , the policy for personal data \napplies, as detailed in 2. Guiding principles . Accordingly, SONATA will inform any external \nstakeholder about its processing of their contact information, with the following details:\nThe overview and objectives of the SONATA project, and why it is relevant for them.\nThe methods of how their contact information was obtained, and how it will be \nprocessed by SONATA.\nThe options to:\noCorrect any inaccurate detail in their contact information.\noRequest the restriction of the processing of their contact detail in any \nspecific case.\noRequest that their contact information to be excluded from SONATA.\n14\nD1.2 – SONATA\nThis project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.These details will be included in a secured registration form  (Microsoft Form) in the \nSONATA SharePoint hosted by KUL, allowing individual stakeholders to execute their \nGDPR rights.\nAll administrative data is overseen by the management team (KUL), the WP leaders, and \ntask leaders. The data is stored within the SONATA SharePoint platform that requires the \nauthentication of the users. The internal administrative data is thus confidential, only \naccessible for the members of the Consortium.\n4.FAIR data\nSONATA will manage data in accordance with the FAIR principle (Findable, Accessible, \nInteroperable and Re-usable data) to maximise access to, and re-use of its research data.  \n4.1.Making data findable\nSONATA will use the Zenodo repository as the main tool to make our open research data \nfindable. A SONATA Horizon community will be established on the Zenodo website, which \nwill host the three FAIR datasets (FAIRD1-3); as well as open technical data. SONATA will \nthen link all Zenodo uploads to the European Commission Funded Research (OpenAIRE)  \ncommunity for maximum findability.\n4.1.1.Metadata\nMetadata associated with each public dataset in Zenodo will by default be as follows:\nPersistent Digital Object Identifiers (DOI)\nVersion numbers for version control\nBibliographic information\nKeywords\nAbstract/description\nAssociated project and community\nAssociated publications and reports\nGrant information\nAccess and licensing info\nLanguage\nSONATA will add the project name and Grant Agreement number.  \n4.1.2.Search keywords\nThe Data Controllers of each dataset will be responsible for uploading public datasets that \nthey have generated, as well as assigning specific search keywords relevant to these \ndatasets. Dataset-specific keywords must be descriptive to the content of the dataset. For \nexample, a dataset containing information on occupant experience collected in the Field \nTrack should be tagged with corresponding keywords such as: “ occupant experience ”, \n“field study”, “public workplace”. \nSONATA has also defined a set of general keywords that should apply to all FAIR datasets, \nscientific publications as well as public deliverables. These are as follow:\narchitectural design\nworkplace design\nbuilding management\nbuilding automation\n15\nD1.2 – SONATA\nThis project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.adaptive technology\ninteractive architecture\nhealth and wellbeing\noccupancy comfort\n4.1.3.Naming convention\nDatasets will be named using the following naming conventions:\nSONATA_DS_DataCategoryCode_ResearchTrack_DataController_Description\n“DS” stands for dataset.\n“DataCategoryCode” refers to the list of data categories described in section 3.2:\noTechnical data: TD\noResearch data: RD\noResearch results: RR\noAdministrative data: AD\n“ResearchTrack” refers to the indicator of the relevant research track, if applicable:\noSituational Track: ST\noOrchestration Track: OT\noSocio-Cultural Track: CT\noField Track: FT\noRecommendation Track: RT\noDissemination Track: DT\n“DataController” refers to the short name of the partner/Data Controller who is \nresponsible for the dataset.\n“Description” refers to a short description of the content of the dataset.\nExample of dataset name:  \nSONATA_DS_RD_FT_KUL_OccupantExperience\nSONATA_TD_FT_KUL_SensorInstallationMap\n4.1.4.Versioning\nSONATA will employ the Zenodo-supported DOI versioning for the open datasets. This \nallows each dataset to be gradually updated after it has been published, during which each \nupdated version will receive a unique DOI, beside a “global DOI” that is assigned to all \nversions as a single “concept”. For example, DOI versioning of a gradually updated FAIR \ndataset can look like:\nFAIRD1 version 1 (specific version): 10.7281/zenodo.60943\nFAIRD1 version 2 (specific version): 10.7281/zenodo.800648\nFAIRD1 Concept (all versions): 10.7281/zenodo.705645\n4.2.Making data accessible\nSubjected to ethical considerations and participant consent, most SONATA data will be \naccessible with as few restrictions as possible . Protected data includes personal and \nsensitive data that is subjected to privacy, commercial, or security reasons. The protocol of \nhow to identify these data is explained in 2. Guiding principles  (for raw personal data), and  \n3.5.3. Research results  (for processed personal data and data that is required for \ncommercial exploitation).\nAs mentioned above, all public datasets, scientific publications and deliverables will be \nuploaded to Zenodo with persistent identifiers (DOIs) and made openly available, free of \ncharge. SONATA Data Controllers may also publish their open data on other repositories \n16\nD1.2 – SONATA\nThis project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.hosted by their organisations, or relevant to their disciplines, which must provide open \naccess as well as persistent identifiers, including such as:\nKU Leuven RDR – Research Data Repository  \nAny other??? – to be extended by partners\n4.3.Making data interoperable\nAs SONATA aims to generate standardised recommendations , data collection and \nprocessing within the project will follow a consistent protocol as outlined in Deliverable 7.3. \nRecommendation binder template & taxonomy  (Month 6). This recommendation binder \nhas been finetuned to reflect the most relevant health & wellbeing standards (e.g. EU-\nOSHA, DIN, ISO) and/or building rating systems (e.g. WELL, LEED, GBC Italia) that \nSONATA aims to influence, allowing a standardised Consortium-wide data approach.\nAs explained in 3.4. Data format, SONATA data interoperability is also ensured by using \nformats that are widely used, preferably non-proprietary formats. Already during the project,  \ndata will be stored in a format that is easily accessible to other project partners. Public data  \nwill only be shared in commonly accessible formats allowed by the repositories.\n4.4.Increase data re-use\nIn general, the data is collected, generated, processed, and synthetised in accordance with \nestablished practices to ensure the data quality. If necessary, guidelines will also be drawn \nup to ensure consistency of data. The common privacy notice and consent templates, as \nshown in section 8. Ethics ensure the consistent approach to GDPR compliance.\nSpecifically, SONATA follows these principles to ensure the re-use of data:  \nData and other outputs that can be made open access should be freely available to \nall in the repositories/archives and databases.  \nMetadata will be included with each dataset as much as possible.\nAll public data and other outputs (where applicable) will be licensed under the \nCreative Commons license CC-BY 4.0. , which preserves sufficient intellectual \nproperty rights for the authors/creators.\nThe dataset will be documented as necessary.\nDocumentation of data ensures the (re)use of data, also during the project but especially \nwhen the data is made openly available for all potential re-users in a repository/archive \ndatabase. The additional documentation describing the data can be presented, for example  \nin read-me-file and provided along with the respective data. The format of the \ndocumentation, therefore, will follow that of the recommendation binder ( Deliverable 7.3. \nRecommendation binder template & taxonomy - Month 6 ).\n5.Allocation of resources\nSONATA uses standard tools and free of charge research data repositories. The costs of \ndata management activities are limited to project management costs ( WP1) and will be \ncovered by allocated resources in the project budget. Long-term preservation of the public \ndata is ensured through Zenodo. Other resources needed to support reuse of data after the  \nproject ends will be solved on a case-by-case basis.\nThe overall responsibility for data management lies with the Project Coordinator  (Andrew \nVande Moere - KUL) and the Project Manager (Alex Binh Vinh Duc Nguyen – KUL). \n17\nD1.2 – SONATA\nThis project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.Supporting the coordinator is a data management team consisting of the Data Controllers \n(see 2.2. Roles and Responsibilities ), the Ethics, Gender & Diversity Manager (Tomáš \nOndráček, MUNI), the IP Manager (Marc Hoppermann, BLDG), and the Quality Assurance  \nManager (Anna Laura Pisello, UNIPG).\n6.Data security\nAll SONATA Data Controllers and Processors will implement appropriate measures to ensure  \nthe protection of personal data, including appropriate research methods and data-processing  \ntools as below:\nDo:\nuse GDPR-compliant tools to collect, process and store research subjects’ \npersonal data.\ntake communications security seriously, following the SONATA dedicated \nprotocols as described in this document.\ncheck the terms and conditions of all of the service providers (software, \napplications, storage, etc.) to process personal data, in order to identify and \nmitigate risks to the data subjects.\nencrypt research data and/or the devices on which they are stored, and ensure \nthat keys/passwords are appropriately protected.\nconsult the respective DPOs (see 2.2. Roles and responsibilities ) or a suitably \nqualified expert when required for advice on how to achieve a level of data \nsecurity that is commensurate to the risks to data subjects.\nDon’t:\ncollect data on a personal device such as a smartphone without ensuring that \nthey are properly protected (e.g. consider the implications of automatic back-ups \nto the cloud, and the device’s security features).\nuse free services that may use participants’ data for their own purposes in lieu of \npayment, or collect data or communicate with research participants via social \nmedia platforms without first assessing the data protection implications.\nuse unencrypted email, SMS or insecure ‘voice over IP’ platforms to \ncommunicate with vulnerable participants.\nexpose personal data to unauthorised access or use when accessing them \nremotely (e.g. by using insecure WIFI connections) or travelling to countries where  \nsuch devices may be inspected or seized.\nassume that research partners, collaborators or service providers have \nappropriate information security and data protection policies without checking \nthat this is the case.\n6.1.Data security as specified for SharePoint\nKUL SharePoint is the online collaboration platform used the SONATA project. A dedicated \nSONATA project site  has been established on this platform, accessible only by the partner \nrepresentatives in the consortium. Only anonymous datasets will be uploaded to this \nSharePoint folder.\nThe KUL SharePoint site has the following security settings:\nAccess level: Restricted to persons (project members only). Further access \nrestrictions on specific folders are enabled.\n18\nD1.2 – SONATA\nThis project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.Version management as standard provided by Microsoft.  In addition, KU Leuven \nprovides a full backup of the data stored on the Sharepoint site in a non-Microsoft \ndata center.\nEncryption: the communication (data transfer) with the SharePoint online cloud \nstorage is done via SSL/TLS. All SSL connections to SharePoint online via the \ninternet are done with 2048-bit keys. Data movements between data centres take \nplace over a private network and are further encrypted. The data is at rest encrypted  \nwith BitLocker disk-level encryption combined with per-file encryption of each file. \nThe per-file encryption is particularly strong, given that the encryption of each file is \ndone with a unique encryption key and that each update of the file is done with the \nsame key. These encryption keys are stored in a different location than where the \nfiles themselves are. The encryption uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with \n256-bit keys and conforms to the American Federal Information Processing \nStandard (FIPS) 140-2.\nThreat management, security monitoring, and file-/data integrity prevents and/or \nregisters possible manipulation of data.\nDocuments and elements in the KUL SharePoint sites are stored in Microsoft's cloud \nsolutions, based in Ireland and the Netherlands. There will be no use of data centres \noutside EU/EEA or in the US.  \nThe non-anonymised personal datasets must be stored locally by the Data Controllers \nand not shared with others, except for contact information of external stakeholders , \nwhich must be stored in a strict access-controlled SharePoint folder, only accessible by \nrespective Data Processors as detailed in Table 1.\nRetention period. Although personal data should, in principle, be kept in a form which \npermits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for \nwhich the personal data are processed, personal data may be stored for longer periods if it \nis processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest or for scientific purposes, \nprovided that appropriate technical and organisational measures are taken (arts. 6.1.e and \n89 of the GDPR). In this regard, SONATA partners agreed that the SharePoint data will \nbe stored for a total period of five years after the end of the project.  However, and to \nthe largest extent possible, personal data will be anonymised as soon as possible .\n6.2.Data security as specified for Zenodo\nThe following list describes the security settings for Zenodo:\nVersions: Data files are versioned. Records are not versioned. The uploaded data is \narchived as a Submission Information Package. Derivatives of data files are \ngenerated, but original content is never modified. Records can be retracted from \npublic view; however, the data files and records are preserved.\nReplicas: All data files are stored in the CERN Data Centres, primarily Geneva, with \nreplicas in Budapest. Data files are kept in multiple replicas in a distributed file \nsystem, which is backed up to tape on a nightly basis.\nRetention period:  Items will be retained for the lifetime of the repository. The host \nlaboratory of Zenodo CERN, has defined a lifetime for the repository of the next 20 \nyears minimum.\nFile preservation:  Data files and metadata are backed up nightly and replicated into  \nmultiple copies in the online system.\nFixity and authenticity:  All data files are stored along with an MD5 checksum of the  \nfile content. Files are regularly checked against their checksums to assure that file \ncontent remains constant.\n19\nD1.2 – SONATA\nThis project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.Succession plans:  In case of closure of the repository, a guarantee has been made \nfrom Zenodo to migrate all content to suitable alternative institutional and/or subject \nbased repositories.\n7.Ethics\nAs shown in Table 6, the SONATA project involves at least 3 data processing operations  \nthat may entail higher ethics risks, according to [2]. This section gives a short overview of \nhow these risks will be managed. The detailed measures will be available in Deliverable \n1.8. Ethics management plan  (Month 6).\nTable 6. Assessment of SONATA data processing operations that may entail higher  \nethics risks and mitigation approaches .\nData processing operations  \nwith higher ethics risksSONATA assessment SONATA mitigation\nTypes of \npersonal \ndataGenetic, biometric or \nhealth dataSONATA will collect from study participants both of their subjective health and well-being, as well as more objective health measures \n(see 3.5.2. Research data).The collection and processing of this special category of personal data will strictly follow the elaborated protocols \noutlined in 2. Guiding principles and 6. Data security, \nas well as any additional principles brough forward by the  independent Ethics Advisor and the Ethics Committees of  the partner organisations.\nData \ncollection and \nprocessing techniquesUsing artificial \nintelligence to \nanalyse personal dataSONATA approach uses AI to determine situations via supervised learning, initially based on synthetic data but then using manually labelled  situations reported by participants through surveys  and voluntary interactions with the HBI interface. The adaptive orchestrations are selected by using AI-based optimisation methods including reinforcement learning and genetic \nalgorithms (see 3.5.1. \nTechnical data)SONATA incorporates a transparent AI development  by \ninforming participants about their interactions with these \nAI technologies through a dedicated workshop before \nthe study commencements.  This information will be continuously available to participants via an interactive tutorial that is offered on \nthe HBI interfaces (e.g. smartphone app/website, public \ndisplay), and be linked to all consent forms and \ninformative posters. The direct feedback from the \nparticipants, together with the qualitative research \nresults from the SSH partners allows SONATA to \nconstantly identify and rectify unforeseen biases in the input data or the algorithm design.  \nThe decision-making of the AI algorithms can always \nand unequivocally be overridden by human input via the \nhuman-in-the-loop approach  and the built-in manual \ncontrols in each of the adaptive technologies.  \nInvolvement of non-EU \ncountriesTransfer of personal data \nto non-EU \ncountriesTECH is based in Israel. Its activities require access to the pseudomine personal data of study participants \n(see 2.2. Roles and \nresponsibilities), yet this \ndata processing does not raise any ethical issues nor relate to any EU Classified Information (EUCI). No studies or physical events are organised in IsraelIsrael has received an ‘adequacy determination’ from the European Commission, indicating that they have a data protection framework offering a level of protection \nequivalent to that provided under EU law.  \nIn all consent forms, this information will be available, and  \nparticipants will be asked to give their explicit consent \nfor their personal data to be processed by non-EU partners. \nFollowing the protocol as outlines in 2. Guiding \nprinciples, Data Controllers are responsible to set out \nAgreements of Data Responsibilities  between themselves and TECH as the joint Data Processor.\n7.1.Informed consent\nAll study participants and external stakeholders will be asked by the respective  Data \nControllers to give their informed consent before any of their personal data is processed. \nThe Data Controllers are responsible to keep records documenting the informed consent \nprocedure, including the information sheets and consent forms provided to research \nparticipants, and the acquisition of their consent to data processing. These may be \nrequested by data subjects, funding agencies or data protection supervisory authorities.\n20\nD1.2 – SONATA\nThis project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.For consent to data processing to be ‘ informed’, the data subject must be provided with \ndetailed information about the envisaged data processing in an intelligible and easily \naccessible form, using clear and plain language. As a minimum, this should include:\nThe identity of the respective Data Controller and, where applicable, the contact \ndetails of the DPO (see 2.2. Roles and responsibilities ).\nThe specific purpose(s) of the processing for which the personal data will be used, \nincluding the aim of the SONATA project and the expected results.\nThe approach of how the personal data will be processed. Specifically, the informed  \nconsent form will explain that personal data will be treated in full confidentiality and \nwill be registered and stored in a secure manner. Collected personal data will always  \nbe pseudonymised or anonymised before it is processed. Published data will always  \nbe anonymous, and no personally identifiable information will be published in any \nway.\nThe identity of the Data Processors who will have access to the data. The informed \nconsent form will state that data will be handled by a very limited number of \nauthorised personnel within the SONATA Consortium, whose confidentiality will be \nregulated by legal agreements.  \nThe subject’s rights as guaranteed by the GDPR and the EU Charter of Fundamental  \nRights, in particular the right to withdraw consent or access their data, the \nprocedures to follow should they wish to do so, the right to not share their data with \npartners outside of the EU, and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory \nauthority.\nHow long the data will be retained before they are destroyed.\n8.Conclusion\nThe approval and release of this deliverable within the consortium constitutes a formal \ncommitment by partners  to adhere to the data management strategy and the procedures \nit defines. When the deliverable is approved by the European Commission, this constitutes \nconfirmation that the procedures are considered by the European Commission to be \nadequate. \nAs coordinator of the SONATA project, KUL will ensure that any data management issues \nwhich may arise during the project will be handled appropriately and in a transparent and \nfair manner. \nThe current report will be a living document throughout the project. The DMP will be updated  \nwhenever significant changes arise, such as (but not limited to) new data, new innovations,  \npatent filings, changes in the consortium members and others.\n21"

Although various adaptive workplace technologies aim to manage these risks, their individual and joint impact on worker health and well-being is still unclear. The EU-funded SONATA project therefore aims to generate evidence-based recommendations on how architectural adaptation can benefit human health and well-being in various hybrid workplace contexts. The project will measure, quantify, and expand the range of health and wellbeing benefits of architectural adaptation, generate empirical knowledge on how multiple adaptations should be combined to maximise their benefits, and ensure that these benefits are distributed in an equitable way among the workers in a shared workplace. 1.2.Purpose of the deliverable This deliverable presents the first version of the SONATA Data Management Plan (DMP) and describes: The guiding principles for data management in the project. The legal framework constituted by the General Data Protection Directive (GDPR). The data summary, which gives an overview of what data will be gathered and processed by SONATA, i.e. categories, contents, formats, volumes. The strategies of how data will be processed in line with the FAIR principles (finable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable). The guidelines to assure data security. A summary of ethics and privacy strategies regarding SONATA data processing. The main purpose of the DMP is to ensure good data handling throughout the project, especially providing guidelines on which SONATA data can be shared with the public and how to make them available. The DMP is a living document and will be updated periodically to reflect the actual research data generated during the project, together with updated instructions for how to access open data. 1.3.Intended audience The dissemination level of D1.2 is ‘ sensitive’ (SEN) and it is available to the members of the Consortium and the European Commission (EC) services. This document is primarily intended to serve as an internal guideline and reference for all SONATA beneficiaries, especially the governance bodies such as the General Assembly, the Steering Committee, the Industry Steering Board, and the Work Package Leaders. 2.Guiding principles The guiding principle of the SONATA project is to be as scientifically open as possible, with 87 out of its 121 deliverables being publicly available. Of the 34 that are not public, 24 are administrative plans and reports, and the remaining 10 are technological prototypes. The handling of SONATA data will conform to the provisions set forth in: a) the GDPR (Regulation (EU) 2016/679), b) the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention 108 for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, and c) national laws applicable to the acquisition of valid consent. 4 D1.2 – SONATA This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.As of April 2024, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is applicable in all Member States in the European Union, as well as in the countries in the European Economic Area (EEA). GDPR updates and modernises existing laws on data protection to strengthen citizens' fundamental rights and guarantee their privacy in the digital age. GDPR regulates the processing by an individual, a company or an organisation of personal data relating to individuals in the EU. GDPR grant individuals a set of rights that must be protected by any actor who processes personal data. SONATA will ensure that its stakeholders assume the highest level of GDPR individual rights .

Personal data categories: Personal data includes ‘any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person’. An ‘identifiable natural person ’, or ‘data subject’, is ‘one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person’ [1]. Special categories of personal data (formerly known as ‘ sensitive data’) are subject to more stringent data-protection safeguards. They include ‘ personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation ’ [1]. 5 D1.2 – SONATA This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.Data processing concepts: Data processing includes ‘any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means , such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction ’ [1]. Pseudonymisation entails substituting personally identifiable information (such as an individual’s name) with a unique identifier that is not connected to their real-world identity, using techniques such as coding or hashing. However, if it is possible to re-identify the individual data subjects by reversing the pseudonymisation process, data protection obligations still apply. They cease to apply only when the data are fully and irreversibly anonymised [2]. Anonymisation involves techniques that can be used to convert personal data into fully and irreversibly anonymised data [2]. Re-identification is the process of turning pseudonymised or anonymised data back into personal data by means of data matching or similar techniques. Roles and responsibilities: A Data Controller is who ‘alone, or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data ’ [2]. A Data Processor is who ‘processes personal data on behalf of the controller ’ [2]. Although fully and irreversibly anonymised data are no longer considered personal data [2], anonymisation processes are challenging, particularly where large datasets containing a wide range of personal data are concerned. 2.2.Roles and responsibilities Only six SONATA partners assume the role of Data Controllers, who directly collects personal data from data subjects, including study participants and external stakeholders, including: Four partners responsible for conducting intervention evaluation studies, who will collect personal data from study participants: oSituational track (ST): UNIPG (Italy). oOrchestration track (OT): UKA (Germany). oSocio-cultural track (CT): IRIUL (Slovenia). oField track (FT): KUL (Belgium). Two partners responsible for the recommendation validation workshops, as well as dissemination, exploitation and communication activities, who will collect personal contact details of external stakeholders : oRecommendation track (RT): MUNI (Czechia). oDissemination track (DT): EVALT (Italy). The Data Controllers are responsible to ensure that their data processing is in line with (1) the Horizon Europe GDPR principles, (2) the EU and national data protectional laws, as well as (3) the ethical requirements from their respective countries and institutions. They are also responsible to pseudonymise or anonymise the data appropriately, and securely store the raw data as well as any re-identification keys as outlined in 6. Data Security 6 D1.2 – SONATA This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.As shown in Table 1, all SONATA partners share the responsibility for processing the collected personal data throughout the course of the project as joint Data Processors, which is necessary for the project implementation.

A summary of this agreement, as well as a single point of contact of the Data Controller, will be provided to the respective data subjects. Together with the Data Controllers, the Data Manager, who is also the Project Coordinator (Andrew Vande Moere, KUL) and the Project Manager (Alex Binh Vinh Duc Nguyen, KUL) are responsible in monitoring the generation and execution of these agreements. SONATA will actively involve the Data Protection Officers (DPOs) appointed by its partner institutions, as well as its External Ethics Advisor (Petr Jemelka, MUNI), to seek for their advises in data processing, privacy, or protection issues. The contact details of the DPOs at the time of writing this deliverable are: KUL: Toon Boon (toon.boon@kuleuven.be ) via KU Leuven GDPR helpdesk . UNIPG: xxx IRIUL: xxx UKA: xxx TECH: xxx MUNI: xxx Any other? For each intervention study, all personal data will only be collected upon receiving informed consent from the participants, and any participant providing personal data can at any time withdraw their participation and related data from the project. The privacy, ethics, and procedures for obtaining informed consent are described in detail in Deliverable 1.8. Ethics management plan (Month 6), and a short summary is provided in 7. Ethics. 7 D1.2 – SONATA This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.3.Data summary SONATA does not consider to re-use any existing data; and will only collect or process data after receiving the explicit consent from data subjects. 3.1.Purpose of data generation Data generation is crucial for SONATA to achieve its three Key Objectives: KO.1: To realise architectural adaptation as a negotiating link between the health- and wellbeing risks and benefits that exist in the workplace, and their physical and mental health outcomes, which can be positively enforced through the purposeful intervention of multi-layered, situational-aware, orchestrated and equitable workplace design principles. To accomplish KO.1, SONATA needs to gather sufficient data to develop and evaluate a situational-aware digital twin able to estimate actual workplace situations by means of fusing automated (quantitative) data about environmental conditions, human occupancy, the positions of assets and wider-scale activities of workers; and voluntary (qualitative) data about individual work activities and preferences. This digital twin then informs an orchestration model able to optimise the holistic health and wellbeing effect of concurrent adaptations on different layers to be more beneficial than the combination of each individual layer separately. To ensure equitable individualised adaptation, a human- building interface (HBI) will allow workers to provide (anonymous) feedback to communicate individual preferences, change mis-estimated situations or fine-tune adaptations to their liking. KO.2: To define the principles of an evaluation methodology that is based on objective and subjective short-term health and wellbeing indicators, which can capture the influence of architectural adaptation in the shared workplace to estimate the benefits and risks for longer-term health and wellbeing of individuals. To accomplish KO.2, SONATA needs to first evaluate the most relevant health and wellbeing benefits and risks for prototypical shared workplaces via a thorough literature review, qualitative observations and interviews with actual workers, and interviews and focus groups with SONATA’s key target group representatives. To measure the health and wellbeing impact of architectural adaptation , SONATA needs to implement intervention evaluation studies through both short-term controlled experiments and longer- term longitudinal experiments, in which the health and wellbeing impact will be quantified through both objective and subjective measures such as environmental, behavioural (e.g., actigraphy) and physiological data collection and processing, and via pre- and post- intervention surveys; and also qualitatively assessed through ethnography-informed research methods (e.g. observation, in-depth interviews). KO.3: To create evidence-based recommendations and guidelines that facilitate the effective application of architectural adaptation for workers, work organisation innovators, architectural designers, OSH experts, building certificate and rating consultants and adaptive technology manufacturers. To accomplish KO.3, SONATA needs to first synthesise its results into a unified recommendation binders with sufficient evidence (e.g. measurement, data log, literature). These recommendations will be validated internally through cost/benefit, sustainability, and barriers to implementation analysis, and participatory workshop with key target group representative; before being externally disseminated to a wide audience of at least four different target groups: individuals, organisations, policymakers, and industry professionals; 8 D1.2 – SONATA This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.who will be invited by SONATA partners from their respective networks. Therefore, collecting contact details of these external stakeholders is crucial. 3.2.Data categories Figure 1 illustrates the four main data categories collected and generated by SONATA, including: technical data, research data, research results, and administrative data. The definitions of these data categories are as below: Technical data: all data related to the implementation and operation of the SONATA architectural adaptation technologies (hardware and software), which is comprised of their source code, schematic design, and their (raw) digital logs. Research data: all data streams from the SONATA research tracks that benchmark individual health and wellbeing impact of adaptation technologies, and then valorise these knowledges into validated recommendations. Within research data, raw non- anonymised and pseudonymised data are personal data. Research results: all processed data that are presented in publications, deliverables, recommendations, output technologies, and business models. Protected research results will feed into patents and licenses following the IP policy, while non-protected results will be made openly accessible as early as possible to comply with Horizon Europe guidelines for Open Science practices. Administrative data: all (confidential) data that is generated or shared internally within the SONATA Consortium for administrative and management purposes. Within these data, the contact information of external stakeholders collected from Consortium partners is personal data. Figure 1. The flow of the four SONATA data categories 3.3.Data generation methodology Table 2 lists the different data generation approaches that SONATA will employ, resulting from a Consortium-wide survey conducted in Month 5 of the Project implementation.

In case any partner employs an unlisted data format, they are required to ensure that such data format ( 1) is internationally accepted, ( 2) is accessible to other relevant partners, and ( 3) follows the FAIR principle (see 4. FAIR data). 3.5.Data overview An early survey allowed the identification of SONATA data overview, categorised as below. This overview will be updated over the course of the project. 3.5.1.Technical data Technical data includes all data related to the implementation and operation of the SONATA architectural adaptation technologies (hardware and software), which is comprised of their source code, technical design, and their digital logs. As some technical data is collected via sensors and control interfaces, they may contain personal data. In this case, the GDPR rules apply (see 2. Guiding principles ).

During the implementation of SONATA, the (automated and manual) digital log of technical data will be organised between six databases, as shown in Figure 2. These databases include: 1.KUL local database. This database is linked to a central system that monitors and controls the robotic behaviours of three adaptation technologies: mobile robotic partitions, kinetic acoustic ceilings, and height-adjusting desks. This database is hosted locally by KUL , using Linux MySQL, ensuring the data security measures. 2.BGRID cloud database.

FAIR dataset collections. 13 D1.2 – SONATA This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.Specifically, SONATA aims to publish three collections of FAIR datasets in the public domain at the end of the project. These datasets include: 1.FAIRD1. Research data : the quantitative and qualitative data streams synthesised from the intervention evaluation studies that are already irreversibly anonymised. 2.FAIRD2. Research results : the processed and analysed research data that inform any SONATA scientific claim or conclusion, disseminated in the form of scientific publications, numerical data, texts, images, tables, and other relevant formats. 3.FAIRD3. Technical data : the generated source code that facilitate the final prototypes of the adaptive technologies - if the IP measures allows. The publication of the three FAIR datasets will be reported in D1.4. FAIR dataset publication 1 (KUL, deadline M24), and D1.5. FAIR dataset publication 2 (KUL, deadline M48). The selection of specific data to be included in each FAIR dataset will be processed by the following parties: The SONATA Data Manager (Andrew Vande Moere, KUL), who will propose the overall structure of each FAIR dataset. The relevant Research Data Controllers (for FAIRD1 and FAIRD2) and Technical Data Controllers (for FAIRD3), as detailed in Table 4 and Table 5, who will feed their collected or generated data into the dataset structure at their own initiatives. The Ethics, Gender & Diversity Manager (Tomáš Ondráček, MUNI), who will perform screenings for privacy and ethics issues in these datasets if requested by concerning partner. The IP Manager (Marc Hoppermann, BLDG), who will inform the Data Controllers and mediate between relevant partners in case any protected data should not be included in the FAIR datasets. As shown in Figure 1, protected research results will feed into patents and licenses following the SONATA IP policy ( Deliverable 1.10. IP strategy plan - Month 24), while non-protected results will be made openly accessible as early as possible to comply with Horizon Europe guidelines for Open Science practices, following the FAIR data strategies as outlines in section 4. FAIR data. 3.5.4.Administrative data Administrative data includes all (confidential) data that is generated or shared internally within the SONATA Consortium for administration and management, such as meeting minutes, recordings, internal reports, etc., for historical purposes and future follow-up; as well as contact information of external stakeholders collected from Consortium partners. In the case of contact information of external stakeholders , the policy for personal data applies, as detailed in 2. Guiding principles . Accordingly, SONATA will inform any external stakeholder about its processing of their contact information, with the following details: The overview and objectives of the SONATA project, and why it is relevant for them. The methods of how their contact information was obtained, and how it will be processed by SONATA. The options to: oCorrect any inaccurate detail in their contact information. oRequest the restriction of the processing of their contact detail in any specific case. oRequest that their contact information to be excluded from SONATA. 14 D1.2 – SONATA This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.These details will be included in a secured registration form (Microsoft Form) in the SONATA SharePoint hosted by KUL, allowing individual stakeholders to execute their GDPR rights. All administrative data is overseen by the management team (KUL), the WP leaders, and task leaders. The data is stored within the SONATA SharePoint platform that requires the authentication of the users. The internal administrative data is thus confidential, only accessible for the members of the Consortium. 4.FAIR data SONATA will manage data in accordance with the FAIR principle (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable data) to maximise access to, and re-use of its research data. 4.1.Making data findable SONATA will use the Zenodo repository as the main tool to make our open research data findable. A SONATA Horizon community will be established on the Zenodo website, which will host the three FAIR datasets (FAIRD1-3); as well as open technical data. SONATA will then link all Zenodo uploads to the European Commission Funded Research (OpenAIRE) community for maximum findability. 4.1.1.Metadata Metadata associated with each public dataset in Zenodo will by default be as follows: Persistent Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) Version numbers for version control Bibliographic information Keywords Abstract/description Associated project and community Associated publications and reports Grant information Access and licensing info Language SONATA will add the project name and Grant Agreement number. 4.1.2.Search keywords The Data Controllers of each dataset will be responsible for uploading public datasets that they have generated, as well as assigning specific search keywords relevant to these datasets. Dataset-specific keywords must be descriptive to the content of the dataset. For example, a dataset containing information on occupant experience collected in the Field Track should be tagged with corresponding keywords such as: “ occupant experience ”, “field study”, “public workplace”. SONATA has also defined a set of general keywords that should apply to all FAIR datasets, scientific publications as well as public deliverables. These are as follow: architectural design workplace design building management building automation 15 D1.2 – SONATA This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.adaptive technology interactive architecture health and wellbeing occupancy comfort 4.1.3.Naming convention Datasets will be named using the following naming conventions: SONATA_DS_DataCategoryCode_ResearchTrack_DataController_Description “DS” stands for dataset. “DataCategoryCode” refers to the list of data categories described in section 3.2: oTechnical data: TD oResearch data: RD oResearch results: RR oAdministrative data: AD “ResearchTrack” refers to the indicator of the relevant research track, if applicable: oSituational Track: ST oOrchestration Track: OT oSocio-Cultural Track: CT oField Track: FT oRecommendation Track: RT oDissemination Track: DT “DataController” refers to the short name of the partner/Data Controller who is responsible for the dataset. “Description” refers to a short description of the content of the dataset. Example of dataset name: SONATA_DS_RD_FT_KUL_OccupantExperience SONATA_TD_FT_KUL_SensorInstallationMap 4.1.4.Versioning SONATA will employ the Zenodo-supported DOI versioning for the open datasets. This allows each dataset to be gradually updated after it has been published, during which each updated version will receive a unique DOI, beside a “global DOI” that is assigned to all versions as a single “concept”. For example, DOI versioning of a gradually updated FAIR dataset can look like: FAIRD1 version 1 (specific version): 10.7281/zenodo.60943 FAIRD1 version 2 (specific version): 10.7281/zenodo.800648 FAIRD1 Concept (all versions): 10.7281/zenodo.705645 4.2.Making data accessible Subjected to ethical considerations and participant consent, most SONATA data will be accessible with as few restrictions as possible . Protected data includes personal and sensitive data that is subjected to privacy, commercial, or security reasons. The protocol of how to identify these data is explained in 2. Guiding principles (for raw personal data), and 3.5.3. Research results (for processed personal data and data that is required for commercial exploitation). As mentioned above, all public datasets, scientific publications and deliverables will be uploaded to Zenodo with persistent identifiers (DOIs) and made openly available, free of charge. SONATA Data Controllers may also publish their open data on other repositories 16 D1.2 – SONATA This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.hosted by their organisations, or relevant to their disciplines, which must provide open access as well as persistent identifiers, including such as: KU Leuven RDR – Research Data Repository Any other??? – to be extended by partners 4.3.Making data interoperable As SONATA aims to generate standardised recommendations , data collection and processing within the project will follow a consistent protocol as outlined in Deliverable 7.3. Recommendation binder template & taxonomy (Month 6). This recommendation binder has been finetuned to reflect the most relevant health & wellbeing standards (e.g. EU- OSHA, DIN, ISO) and/or building rating systems (e.g. WELL, LEED, GBC Italia) that SONATA aims to influence, allowing a standardised Consortium-wide data approach. As explained in 3.4. Data format, SONATA data interoperability is also ensured by using formats that are widely used, preferably non-proprietary formats. Already during the project, data will be stored in a format that is easily accessible to other project partners. Public data will only be shared in commonly accessible formats allowed by the repositories. 4.4.Increase data re-use In general, the data is collected, generated, processed, and synthetised in accordance with established practices to ensure the data quality. If necessary, guidelines will also be drawn up to ensure consistency of data. The common privacy notice and consent templates, as shown in section 8. Ethics ensure the consistent approach to GDPR compliance. Specifically, SONATA follows these principles to ensure the re-use of data: Data and other outputs that can be made open access should be freely available to all in the repositories/archives and databases. Metadata will be included with each dataset as much as possible. All public data and other outputs (where applicable) will be licensed under the Creative Commons license CC-BY 4.0. , which preserves sufficient intellectual property rights for the authors/creators. The dataset will be documented as necessary. Documentation of data ensures the (re)use of data, also during the project but especially when the data is made openly available for all potential re-users in a repository/archive database. The additional documentation describing the data can be presented, for example in read-me-file and provided along with the respective data. The format of the documentation, therefore, will follow that of the recommendation binder ( Deliverable 7.3. Recommendation binder template & taxonomy - Month 6 ). 5.Allocation of resources SONATA uses standard tools and free of charge research data repositories. The costs of data management activities are limited to project management costs ( WP1) and will be covered by allocated resources in the project budget. Long-term preservation of the public data is ensured through Zenodo. Other resources needed to support reuse of data after the project ends will be solved on a case-by-case basis. The overall responsibility for data management lies with the Project Coordinator (Andrew Vande Moere - KUL) and the Project Manager (Alex Binh Vinh Duc Nguyen – KUL). 17 D1.2 – SONATA This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.Supporting the coordinator is a data management team consisting of the Data Controllers (see 2.2. Roles and Responsibilities ), the Ethics, Gender & Diversity Manager (Tomáš Ondráček, MUNI), the IP Manager (Marc Hoppermann, BLDG), and the Quality Assurance Manager (Anna Laura Pisello, UNIPG). 6.Data security All SONATA Data Controllers and Processors will implement appropriate measures to ensure the protection of personal data, including appropriate research methods and data-processing tools as below: Do: use GDPR-compliant tools to collect, process and store research subjects’ personal data. take communications security seriously, following the SONATA dedicated protocols as described in this document. check the terms and conditions of all of the service providers (software, applications, storage, etc.) to process personal data, in order to identify and mitigate risks to the data subjects. encrypt research data and/or the devices on which they are stored, and ensure that keys/passwords are appropriately protected. consult the respective DPOs (see 2.2. Roles and responsibilities ) or a suitably qualified expert when required for advice on how to achieve a level of data security that is commensurate to the risks to data subjects. Don’t: collect data on a personal device such as a smartphone without ensuring that they are properly protected (e.g. consider the implications of automatic back-ups to the cloud, and the device’s security features). use free services that may use participants’ data for their own purposes in lieu of payment, or collect data or communicate with research participants via social media platforms without first assessing the data protection implications. use unencrypted email, SMS or insecure ‘voice over IP’ platforms to communicate with vulnerable participants. expose personal data to unauthorised access or use when accessing them remotely (e.g. by using insecure WIFI connections) or travelling to countries where such devices may be inspected or seized. assume that research partners, collaborators or service providers have appropriate information security and data protection policies without checking that this is the case. 6.1.Data security as specified for SharePoint KUL SharePoint is the online collaboration platform used the SONATA project. A dedicated SONATA project site has been established on this platform, accessible only by the partner representatives in the consortium. Only anonymous datasets will be uploaded to this SharePoint folder. The KUL SharePoint site has the following security settings: Access level: Restricted to persons (project members only). Further access restrictions on specific folders are enabled. 18 D1.2 – SONATA This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.Version management as standard provided by Microsoft. In addition, KU Leuven provides a full backup of the data stored on the Sharepoint site in a non-Microsoft data center. Encryption: the communication (data transfer) with the SharePoint online cloud storage is done via SSL/TLS. All SSL connections to SharePoint online via the internet are done with 2048-bit keys. Data movements between data centres take place over a private network and are further encrypted. The data is at rest encrypted with BitLocker disk-level encryption combined with per-file encryption of each file. The per-file encryption is particularly strong, given that the encryption of each file is done with a unique encryption key and that each update of the file is done with the same key. These encryption keys are stored in a different location than where the files themselves are. The encryption uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with 256-bit keys and conforms to the American Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2. Threat management, security monitoring, and file-/data integrity prevents and/or registers possible manipulation of data. Documents and elements in the KUL SharePoint sites are stored in Microsoft's cloud solutions, based in Ireland and the Netherlands. There will be no use of data centres outside EU/EEA or in the US. The non-anonymised personal datasets must be stored locally by the Data Controllers and not shared with others, except for contact information of external stakeholders , which must be stored in a strict access-controlled SharePoint folder, only accessible by respective Data Processors as detailed in Table 1. Retention period. Although personal data should, in principle, be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed, personal data may be stored for longer periods if it is processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest or for scientific purposes, provided that appropriate technical and organisational measures are taken (arts. 6.1.e and 89 of the GDPR). In this regard, SONATA partners agreed that the SharePoint data will be stored for a total period of five years after the end of the project. However, and to the largest extent possible, personal data will be anonymised as soon as possible . 6.2.Data security as specified for Zenodo The following list describes the security settings for Zenodo: Versions: Data files are versioned. Records are not versioned. The uploaded data is archived as a Submission Information Package. Derivatives of data files are generated, but original content is never modified. Records can be retracted from public view; however, the data files and records are preserved. Replicas: All data files are stored in the CERN Data Centres, primarily Geneva, with replicas in Budapest. Data files are kept in multiple replicas in a distributed file system, which is backed up to tape on a nightly basis. Retention period: Items will be retained for the lifetime of the repository. The host laboratory of Zenodo CERN, has defined a lifetime for the repository of the next 20 years minimum. File preservation: Data files and metadata are backed up nightly and replicated into multiple copies in the online system. Fixity and authenticity: All data files are stored along with an MD5 checksum of the file content. Files are regularly checked against their checksums to assure that file content remains constant. 19 D1.2 – SONATA This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.Succession plans: In case of closure of the repository, a guarantee has been made from Zenodo to migrate all content to suitable alternative institutional and/or subject based repositories. 7.Ethics As shown in Table 6, the SONATA project involves at least 3 data processing operations that may entail higher ethics risks, according to [2]. This section gives a short overview of how these risks will be managed. The detailed measures will be available in Deliverable 1.8. Ethics management plan (Month 6). Table 6. Assessment of SONATA data processing operations that may entail higher ethics risks and mitigation approaches . Data processing operations with higher ethics risksSONATA assessment SONATA mitigation Types of personal dataGenetic, biometric or health dataSONATA will collect from study participants both of their subjective health and well-being, as well as more objective health measures (see 3.5.2. Research data).The collection and processing of this special category of personal data will strictly follow the elaborated protocols outlined in 2. Guiding principles and 6. Data security, as well as any additional principles brough forward by the independent Ethics Advisor and the Ethics Committees of the partner organisations. Data collection and processing techniquesUsing artificial intelligence to analyse personal dataSONATA approach uses AI to determine situations via supervised learning, initially based on synthetic data but then using manually labelled situations reported by participants through surveys and voluntary interactions with the HBI interface. The adaptive orchestrations are selected by using AI-based optimisation methods including reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms (see 3.5.1. Technical data)SONATA incorporates a transparent AI development by informing participants about their interactions with these AI technologies through a dedicated workshop before the study commencements. This information will be continuously available to participants via an interactive tutorial that is offered on the HBI interfaces (e.g. smartphone app/website, public display), and be linked to all consent forms and informative posters. The direct feedback from the participants, together with the qualitative research results from the SSH partners allows SONATA to constantly identify and rectify unforeseen biases in the input data or the algorithm design. The decision-making of the AI algorithms can always and unequivocally be overridden by human input via the human-in-the-loop approach and the built-in manual controls in each of the adaptive technologies. Involvement of non-EU countriesTransfer of personal data to non-EU countriesTECH is based in Israel. Its activities require access to the pseudomine personal data of study participants (see 2.2. Roles and responsibilities), yet this data processing does not raise any ethical issues nor relate to any EU Classified Information (EUCI). No studies or physical events are organised in IsraelIsrael has received an ‘adequacy determination’ from the European Commission, indicating that they have a data protection framework offering a level of protection equivalent to that provided under EU law. In all consent forms, this information will be available, and participants will be asked to give their explicit consent for their personal data to be processed by non-EU partners. Following the protocol as outlines in 2. Guiding principles, Data Controllers are responsible to set out Agreements of Data Responsibilities between themselves and TECH as the joint Data Processor. 7.1.Informed consent All study participants and external stakeholders will be asked by the respective Data Controllers to give their informed consent before any of their personal data is processed. The Data Controllers are responsible to keep records documenting the informed consent procedure, including the information sheets and consent forms provided to research participants, and the acquisition of their consent to data processing. These may be requested by data subjects, funding agencies or data protection supervisory authorities. 20 D1.2 – SONATA This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Actions programme under Grant Agreement no. 101137507.For consent to data processing to be ‘ informed’, the data subject must be provided with detailed information about the envisaged data processing in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. As a minimum, this should include: The identity of the respective Data Controller and, where applicable, the contact details of the DPO (see 2.2. Roles and responsibilities ). The specific purpose(s) of the processing for which the personal data will be used, including the aim of the SONATA project and the expected results. The approach of how the personal data will be processed. Specifically, the informed consent form will explain that personal data will be treated in full confidentiality and will be registered and stored in a secure manner. Collected personal data will always be pseudonymised or anonymised before it is processed. Published data will always be anonymous, and no personally identifiable information will be published in any way. The identity of the Data Processors who will have access to the data. The informed consent form will state that data will be handled by a very limited number of authorised personnel within the SONATA Consortium, whose confidentiality will be regulated by legal agreements. The subject’s rights as guaranteed by the GDPR and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, in particular the right to withdraw consent or access their data, the procedures to follow should they wish to do so, the right to not share their data with partners outside of the EU, and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. How long the data will be retained before they are destroyed. 8.Conclusion The approval and release of this deliverable within the consortium constitutes a formal commitment by partners to adhere to the data management strategy and the procedures it defines. When the deliverable is approved by the European Commission, this constitutes confirmation that the procedures are considered by the European Commission to be adequate. As coordinator of the SONATA project, KUL will ensure that any data management issues which may arise during the project will be handled appropriately and in a transparent and fair manner. The current report will be a living document throughout the project. The DMP will be updated whenever significant changes arise, such as (but not limited to) new data, new innovations, patent filings, changes in the consortium members and others. 21"
