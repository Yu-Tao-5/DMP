The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\n1.General Information\nName applicant Devika Rajagopal\nFWO Project Number & Title 1S44622N \nNovel large-area two-terminal solution-processed perovskite/silicon tandem modules by shingling: \ndetailed analysis of material interactions and loss factors\nAffiliation ☒ KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent\n☐ Universiteit Hasselt  \n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel\n☐ Other: \n2.Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make  \nuse of existing data?  ☒ Generate new data\n☒ Reuse existing data\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 2Describe the origin, type and format of the data \n(per dataset) and its (estimated) volume\nIf you reuse existing data, specify the source of these \ndata. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from \ndata formats (the technical format).(1)Published papers for literature study\nOrigin: Scientific journals, conference proceedings\nFormat: Pdf, powerpoints\n(2)Cell measurements\nOrigin: From cell measurements through experiments\nFormat: Usually stored as .txt files and graphs plotted using origin\n(3)Other characterization data (SEM, AFM, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, etc...)\nOrigin: From experiments\n(4)Simulation data\nOrigin: From simulations in matlab or other softwares\nMost of the data in this PhD will be new data generated by experiments. It is possible to use some already \nexisting data (such as cell results, SEM images, etc... from previous students’ work) for comparison \npurposes.\n3.Ethical and legal issues\nWill you use personal data? If so, shortly describe  \nthe kind of personal data you will use AND add  \nthe  reference  to  your  file  in  your  host  \ninstitution's privacy register.\nIn case your host institution does not (yet) have a  \nprivacy register, a reference is not yet required of  \ncourse; please add the reference once the privacy  \nregister is in place in your host institution.☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes: \n-Privacy Registry Reference:\n-Short description of the kind of personal data that will be used:\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 3Are there any ethical issues concerning the \ncreation and/or use of the data (e.g. \nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If  \nso, add the reference to the formal approval by \nthe relevant ethical review committee(s).☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes: \n-Reference to ethical committee approval:\nDoes your work possibly result in research data  \nwith potential for tech transfer and valorisation?  \nWill IP restrictions be claimed for the data you  \ncreated?  If  so,  for  what  data  and  which  \nrestrictions will be asserted?☒ Yes\n☐ No\nIf yes, please comment: It is possible that the results in this project have the potential for tech transfer and  \nvalorisation. The results which involve experiments which uses 3rd party materials/setups whose IP cannot \nbe disclosed without their consent.  Most of the data will be owned by imec along with the host institute, \nas imec owns majority of the equipment and materials used in this project. Designs/processes created \nduring this project may have IP restrictions placed, whose results can only be published after IP \narrangements are done\nDo  existing  3rd party  agreements  restrict  \ndissemination  or  exploitation  of  the  data  you  \n(re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and  \nwhat restrictions are in place?☒ Yes\n☐ No\nIf yes, please comment: Some experiments use IP by external companies. To publish the results of such \nexperiments, prior consent from their end is required. The extent of the data published will be determined  \nafter consultation with the external company.\n4.Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable \nunderstanding and reuse of the data \ncollected/generated in this project?  The FWO plan included one publication per work package. Hence, the experiments and resulting data \ngenerated will be published. Yearly reports will be prepared. Detailed interpretation of data (and the \nexperimental plans and setups) will be made as presentations ( or reports ) on a bi-weekly basis which will \nbe updated as the experiments proceed.  \n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 4Will a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be used.  If  \nnot, state in detail which metadata will be \ncreated to make the data easy/easier to find \nand reuse.☐ Yes\n☒ No\nSince this is a highly experimental project, an official metadata standard cannot be used. Currently, all the \nexperiments are documented in excel with detailed experimental setup data and results. These are stored \nin the imec database. Plans and discussions are also stored in one note which are backed up in the imec \ndatabase, which will be translated into the excel plan tracker as the experiments proceed. For better \nunderstanding of the raw data which is stored in folders, a ‘readme’ .txt file is prepared for every folder, \nwhich explains what each kind of data is and its origin.\nIf yes, please specify:\n5.Data storage & backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?   The data will be stored in sharepoint/onedrive environment created by imec.  \nHow will the data be backed up?  The data in sharepoint/onedrive is automatically backed up into the cloud.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.  ☒ Yes\nSufficient TB of data storage capacity is provided by imec in its sharepoint/onedrive platforms. An issue of \nstorage capacity is not likely to happen during the duration of this PhD\n☐ No\nIf no, please specify:  \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the project? How will these \ncosts be covered? \nAlthough FWO has no earmarked budget at its \ndisposal to support correct research data \nmanagement, FWO allows for part of the allocated \nproject budget to be used to cover the cost incurred.As the data storage is provided by imec to its employees/students for free, the cost is not known. The use \nof allocated project budget for purchasing data storage and backup will not happen during duration of this  \nPhD.\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 5Data security: how will you ensure that the data \nare securely stored and not accessed or \nmodified by unauthorized persons?  All the data stored in sharepoint/onedrive environments are labelled with a ‘confidential’ marker. \nFurthermore, specific permission by the folder owner needs to be acquired to access the data. \nAdditionally, when one shares the data, he/she can choose if the data is shared as ‘readonly’ or will be \nwith editing permission. Since these platforms are provided by imec, a high security is expected.\n6.Data preservation after the end of the FWO project\nFWO expects that data generated during the project are retained for a period of minimally 5 years after the end of the project, in as far as legal and  \ncontractual agreements allow.\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 \nyear period after the end of the project? In case \nonly a selection of the data can/will be \npreserved, clearly state the reasons  for this \n(legal or contractual restrictions, physical \npreservation issues, ...). All the data generated during this thesis will be stored for the expected 5 year period after the end of the \nthesis. Most important data will be the ones used for publications. The rest of the data (including \nexperimental plans and setups) will also be stored for future projects and further research.\nWhere will these data be archived (= stored for \nthe long term)? The data will be retained on the same environment as mentioned above. Additionally access will  be \nshared with the promotor (Jef Poortmans), daily supervisor (Hariharsudan Sivaramakrishnan) and team \nleader (Loic Tous).\nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during these 5 years? How will the \ncosts be covered? \nAlthough FWO has no earmarked budget at its \ndisposal to support correct research data \nmanagement, FWO allows for part of the allocated \nproject budget to be used to cover the cost incurred.No costs are expected since the data will continue to be stored in the same environment\n7.Data sharing and reuse\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 6Are there any factors restricting or preventing \nthe sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as \ndefined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal \nrestrictions)? ☒ Yes\n☐ No\nIf yes, please specify: Some experiments are conducted with the materials provided by third parties. Since \nthese are intellectual properties of the companies, it is required to ask permission regrading the extent of \ndata which can be shared.  \nWhich data will be made available after the end \nof the project? Data which are not a result of experiments involving third party collaborations are to be shared with the \nconsensus of the promoter/supervisor.  \nWhere/how will the data be made available for \nreuse? ☐ In an Open Access repository\n☐ In a restricted access repository\n☒ Upon request by mail\n☐ Other (specify):\nWhen will the data be made available?  After the results are published. If internal teams/projects require this data before the publication of results  \nfor their own research, data can be shared on a mutual agreement, given that it will be properly cited.\nWho will be able to access the data and under \nwhat conditions? The promoter, supervisor and team lead will have free access to the data.  \nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? \nHow will these costs be covered?  \nAlthough FWO has no earmarked budget at its \ndisposal to support correct research data \nmanagement, FWO allows for part of the allocated \nproject budget to be used to cover the cost incurred.There are not foreseen expenses for data sharing. Again, this will depend on who requires the data and for  \nwhat purpose. If the data needs to be used by future students/researchers within the group, no costs are \ninvolved. However, if the data is required in an industrial concept, costs may be involved which can be \ndetermined by the supervisor.\n8.Responsibilities\nWho will be responsible for the data \ndocumentation & metadata?  Throughout the duration of the PhD, I will be responsible for the documentation and metadata\nWho will be responsible for data storage & back \nup during the project?  Throughout the duration of the PhD, I will be responsible for the data storage and backup\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 7Who will be responsible for ensuring data \npreservation and sharing?  Throughout the duration of the PhD, I will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and sharing. \nSharing will be done in consultation with the supervisor\nWho bears the end responsibility for updating &  \nimplementing this DMP?  \nDefault response: The PI bears the overall \nresponsibility for updating & implementing this DMPThe PI bears the overall responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP"
