Especially production of building materials\nweighs heavily on the environment. The NDT-ReMat project aims at an increased and informed reuse of construction materials. At\npresent, required technologies for efficient condition assessment and certification of reuse materials are lacking. In the NDT-ReMat\nproject, non-destructive testing (NDT) methods for condition assessment are developed, tested and validated to address this challenge.\nAdvanced NDT methods employing multi-frequency mechanical wave-based techniques (from ultrasonics to acoustics and vibrations)\nare developed for three selected material groups: clay bricks, RC panels and timber beams. A two-step test program is planned. Firstly,\nNDT protocols are tested on new materials subjected to accelerated ageing, allowing control of property ranges and boundary conditions,\nensuring suitable test populations. Secondly, developed NDT methods are validated on real sets of reuse materials. Multi-variate\nregression models are developed for robust data interpretation, model updating in a Bayesian framework, and linking between material\nproperties and multi-frequency NDT results. The project team consists of experts from KU Leuven, UGent and Buildwise, with strong\ncollaboration and complementary expertise, covering all required aspects to successfully reach the project’s scientific goals as well as\noptimizing its utilization potential.\nID: \nID: \n209610\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-04-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n31-03-2026\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n21-08-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
