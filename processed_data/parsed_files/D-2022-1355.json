We investigate how to deal with the\nlarge discrepancies in cost for \ngenerating data points as well as evaluating white and black-box\nmodels, in order to build an efficient grey-box model. Specific point of attention is the reliability\nof the model, especially where strong extrapolation is required. Experimental data will be\ncollected for model validation, black-box model generation and refinement, weld quality\nassessment and process monitoring. Numerical data will be generated for weld process\nsimulation, and mirroring.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. Data Description\nWhat data will you collect or create?
