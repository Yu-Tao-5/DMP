In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Biologicals will be retained when possible. The storage will be at (1) room temperature, (2) 4°C, (3) -20°C, (4) -80°C, (5) -150°C, according to the type of biological material. As a general rule, data will be preserved for a minimum term of 10 years. Datasets collected in the context of clinical research, which fall under the scope of the Belgian Law of 7 May 2004, will be archived for 25 years, in agreement with the University Hospital policies and the European Regulation 536/2014 on clinical trials of medicinal products for human use. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?

Digital data will be stored on KU Leuven storage space: the KU Leuven L-Drive ( virtually unlimited size) has sufficient storage capacity for the outlined project. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The annual cost of storage is approximately 569.2 € per 5TB of storage space per year. This cost and capacity include the performance of mirror copies of the stored data, for safety backup purposes. We expect that 15 TB will be sufficient to store all data generated as part of the project. These costs will be covered by the budget of the project leader. 5. Data sharing and reuse 5.

In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. dataset or data type which data will be made available. Other, please specify: The key findings of the project and their interpretation will be made available through publication of journal articles in established, peer-reviewed non-predatory) academic journals. Relevant raw data will be made publicly available through upload to well- established open-access data repositories. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Data may be shared externally upon reasonable requests from collaborating scientists, which will be reviewed and approved on a case-by-case basis by the project leaders. We do not exclude that the proposed work could result in research data with the potential for tech transfer and valorization. The partner institutes have a policy to actively monitor research data for such potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of cases, the invention will be IP protected (mostly patent protection or copyright protection). As such the IP protection does not withhold the research data from being made public. In the case a decision is taken to file a patent application it will be planned so that any delay to publication is minimal. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?

If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. Depending on the nature of the dataset both open-access and restricted-access repositories will be used to store data. All requests and approvals for reuse of data other than those deposited in open-access repositories will be assessed on a case-by- case basis by the project leaders. When will the data be made available? When will the data be made available? As study leader, Prof. Massimiliano Mazzone will monitor data sharing requests.

Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. Data not deposited in open-access repositories will in principle only be accessible to members of the lab. Other collaborations and sharing are possible with staff and students within the VIB–KU Leuven Center for Cancer Biology, as well as within the KU Leuven Department of Oncology, upon reasonable request. Any user can place reasonable requests data for non-commercial purposes, and these requests will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the project leaders.
