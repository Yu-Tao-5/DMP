The FWO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.  At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.        \n FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven       2  1. General Project Information  Name Grant Holder & ORCID Christian Schwarz Contributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Steven Bouillon, co-PI Project number 1 & title  C14/23/086 Interactions between river-geomorphology, carbon transport and floodplain carbon sequestration Funder(s) GrantID 2 C14/23/086 Affiliation(s) ☐ KU Leuven  ☐ Universiteit Antwerpen ☐ Universiteit Gent  ☐ Universiteit Hasselt ☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  ☐ Other: ROR identifier KU Leuven: 05f950310 Please provide a short project description Rivers link many parts of the landscape and through hydrologic connectivity with their floodplains were shown to be able to store significant amounts of organic carbon (OC) worldwide. Terrestrial organic carbon transport, transformation or storage is inextricably intertwined with the geomorphological landscape configuration resulting from the transport, erosion and deposition of sediments. However the interactions between geomorphology and floodplain carbon dynamics are poorly understood. This project uses the Tana and Sabaki rivers in Kenia as reference systems, to first quantify the interactions between floodplain morphodynamics and C storage and subsequently create a numerical model framework able to predict how changes in river morphology affect C storage.       1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number. This question is optional. Applicants can only provide one project number.  2 Funder(s) GrantID refers to the number of the DMP at the funder(s), here one can specify multiple GrantIDs if multiple funding sources were used. \n FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven       3      \n FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven       4  2.

Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide. ☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☒ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? 6. Data Sharing and Reuse FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13 Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS.

If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available?
