The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Lidiia Rumiantseva & https://orcid.org/0009-0003-5054-4292\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles\nProject number  & title  11Q0P24N (FWO number)\nExploring the use of isotopomers in tracer metabolomics to understand the activity and connectivity of \nbiochemical pathways.\nFunder(s) GrantID 2Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)\nAffiliation(s) ☑KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Other:\nROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\nPlease provide a short project description          ,   Metabolomics investigates the whole of biochemical reactions occurring on the cellular organ or\n .               organism level Its importance for the biomedical society is reflected by the fact that the obtained\n            biochemical insights into the molecular assembly of the network reveal the targetable\n/ . ,           enzymesproteins Yet studying metabolism is not trivial and certain approaches such as untargeted  \n        .       metabolomics rarely lead to insights into the disease mechanisms The reason for this relates to the  \n             fact that merely looking at metabolite abundances doesn't necessarily lead to understanding the\n   .          mechanisms underlying the disease Several reasons attribute to the increase of a specific\n    ,  ,  , .    metabolite such as more synthesis less degradation malfunctioning transport etc The field of\n        .
