Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). Each researcher keeps a digital lab notebook with a description of all performed experiments. The lab notebook contains information on how data were generated: the composition, method, temperature, incubation conditions, and a reference to the loading conditions of the considered material. In addition, modifications to protocols are written down in the lab notebook and the place where the material is being stored is also mentioned in the lab notebook. The digital lab notebook is stored on the J-drive and, once the research project has ended, will be stored on the K-drive for long-term storage. Raw data files of read-outs, analyzed data and statistical analyses are being stored on the J-drive and will be transferred to the K-drive at the end of the research project. The name of the folder of the saved data refers to the date, project, specifications and version of the data. All folders are organized on the j-drive according to the project, results, proposal, papers, presentation, administration, … Each researcher has access to his/her folder on the j-drive and a common folder of the lab containing protocols, list of plasmids, list of antibodies, list of cell lines. Only the PI and the lab manager have access to all folders. Furthermore, data will be made available to the broad audience as publications in peer reviewed journals.
