However, the high pill\nburden results in significant problems with patient compliance, which hampers adherence and consequently impacts overall treatment\nefficacy. Moreover, the administration of these drugs would ideally follow a specific pulsatile release timeline during the evening and\nnight and spanning 10 h after intake. Currently, no solutions exist for such long controlled-release sequences due to the complexity\nadded by gastrointestinal motility. This fellowship will address these challenges by developing a radically new\napproach to gastroretentive controlled-release dosage forms, namely through 3D printing. The case of cardiovascular disease treatment\nwill be taken as a challenging demonstration to showcase the capabilities of the proposed technology. Nevertheless, the project will\nresult in a platform that can be used for several treatment cases and will open up diverse valorization routes.\nID: \nID: \n211131\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-11-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n31-10-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n06-12-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes The study holds great potential for tech transfer and valorization. The foundations for valorization of the project’s results are already present in the IP portfolio maintained by the host group on the controlled capillary wicking in porous 3D printed objects (‘3D printing of porous liquid handling device’, Granted WO2018162476 A1, Pending US20200016829 A1, Pending EP3592562 A1). Further opportunities for IP Generation during the project will be identified in close dialogue with the tech transfer office KU Leuven Research & Development (LRD) and the host’s group valorization manager Dr. Bart Van Duffel.

No No uniform metadata standard is available for all different aspects and disciplines of this project. Therefore, the data management system, implemented by all group members, provides a uniform system to enhance the use of secondary data. The meta data (date, objective, protocol (data types and conducted characterization techniques), processed data, roadmap,…) is covered by a number of predetermined topics which are entailed in the Central Experiment Index and Electronic Lab Book. 3.

The data will be stored via a cloud storage solution that allows sharing with the WP leaders and researchers involved in the project. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? The data on the cloud storage server are automatically backed up. Unlimited versioning is included in the selected plan so that accidental erasing or modifying does not pose a risk.

If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes The total amount of data generated during the project should not exceed a few TB and is therefore compatible with the selected cloud storage solution. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? A secured environment is provided by the cloud system (Dropbox). Only after receiving an invitational link one can access a predetermined space in the cloud. Hereby unauthorized persons cannot access the information unless personally given.

Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? All the generated data will be stored on the cloud storage server for a period of 5 years after the end of the project. Beyond 5 years after the end of the project, one of the following options will be picked (1) continuation of storing the data on the cloud storage server or (2) transferring the data to the KU Leuven central servers for archiving. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The annual cost for long-term storage of the data, either through a cloud storage service or the university's central servers, is estimated at a few hundred euro. Since the budget of the current project will no longer be available, creative solutions will have to be found. 5. Data sharing and reuse 5.
