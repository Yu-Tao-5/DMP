Exposure treatment, based on the principles of inhibitory (extinction) learning, is the first-choice treatment for these\ndisorders. Although proven effective in numerous experiments, exposure treatment has been rather prone to relapse and dropout.

To improve the efficacy of fear extinction, there has been\ngrowing scientific interest in employing counterconditioning techniques, which uses rewards during the omissions in extinction.

Additional backups can be made and stored on personal drives, being encrypted and password protected back-up drives such as the PhD students own laptop or external hard drives. Data in paper format (ICF, exclusion criteria forms & adverse events forms) are stored separately in a key-locked cabinet in a dedicated archive room of the research group. After completing the project, the archive drive within the LBP (Laboratory of Biological Psychology) will be used to store all data for at least 10 years, in agreement with the university's data management policy. As for the data collection at the University of Melbourne, all data will be stored on a password protected REDCap computer database on the University of Melbourne server. The data will be retained for a minimum of 5 years after publication of the results, in accordance with the Australian national data and privacy legislations. How will the data be backed up?
