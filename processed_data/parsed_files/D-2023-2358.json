Behavioural and\npsychological symptoms of dementia lead to the decision to institutionalise PwD, ahead of the cognitive decline. Specifically, agitation is the most\ncritical behavioural problem seen in dementia and is present in 50-80% of PwD. Agitation leads to dire consequences for PwD, their environment and\nsociety. However, there is limited understanding what happens physiologically during agitation, there is currently no way to robustly detect agitation\nand there is a clear need to understand what causes agitation in each person with dementia. In this research project, we propose a multimodal sensing\nplatform for non-obtrusive in-depth analysis of agitation in PwD. We aim to discover digital markers for measuring agitation objectively, safely and\ncontinuously and identify triggers for agitation both on an individual and population level.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n12-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
