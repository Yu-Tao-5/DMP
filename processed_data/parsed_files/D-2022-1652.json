We will analyze the circulation of knowledge in the ancient world through the study of the mention of names\n(both of authors and other historical figures) in the corpus of Latin and Ancient Greek literary texts. Using automated NLP methodologies,\nwe will reconstruct the network of mentions in ancient texts and, building on the methodologies of economics and social network analysis,\nwe will analyze the flow of intellectual influences through the network, and the impact of well-known historical events on this flow. We aim\nat building a methodological framework for applying models developed for present-day networks on data of antiquity; improving the\ncombination of different AI methods; and providing new insights on the knowledge circulation in the ancient world, with a special focus on\nthe advent of Christianity.\nLast modified: \n31-03-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
