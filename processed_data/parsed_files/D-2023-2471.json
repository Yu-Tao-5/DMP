Documentation and Metadata 5 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 8 Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). - Project overview document : A high -level document will outline the project’s goals, methodologies, and expected outcomes in order to serve as an interpretative guide. - README files : all datasets will be accompanied with a README file that contains a detailed description of the dataset, the structure of the data, an overview of any preprocessing steps applied, and information on how to access and use the data . - Code documentation : For any scripts developed as part of the research, s ource code comments will be added in order to explain the logic and functionality of the code. - Version control : A version control system (i.e., Git) will be used to keep track of code changes over time, thereby allowing for rollbacks to earlier versions and understanding the evolution of the project. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: A custom metadata scheme will be created to tailored to the unique aspects of legal documents and NLP research outputs . Relevant metadata elements include: k eywords , creator, date published, version, format, language, legal domain, access information. 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? - KU Leuven OneDrive - Google Drive FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9 How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS , STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON -DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH .6 REFER TO INSTITUTION -SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE . ☒ Standard back -up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☒ Personal back -ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Data also will be backed up on my personal password protected Google Drive storage. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: There is enough space to store the data on the KU Leuven OneDrive and to make back -ups on my personal Google Drive . If no, please specify : How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 6 The normal access control measures will be applied, including encrypted passwords and two -factor authenticatio n. Data backups will be performed regularly to prevent data loss, with the backup process also adhering to the same access protocols. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Expected data storage costs are minimal as the KU Leuven OneDrive is provided at no additional cost for academic purposes . My personal Google Drive offers free storage up to 15GB, with affordable options for additional space if necessary. 6 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). All data will be preserved for 10 years according to the KU Leuven R esearch Data Management policy Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? The KU Leuven’s Research Data Repository (https://rdr.kuleuven.be/) What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Expected long -term data storage costs are minimal as the KU Leuven’s Research Data Repository is provided at no additional cost for academic purposes . FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE , CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY . AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS . FOR MORE INFORMATION : HTTPS ://WIKI.SURFNET .NL/DISPLAY /STANDARDS /INFO-EU- REPO /#INFOEUREPO -ACCESS RIGHTS ☐ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☒ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Data will be under a two -year embargo to enable the pursuit of follow -on research. Once the relevant publications have been released, the data will transition to open access for broader use. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify : Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. The KU Leuven’s Research Data Repository (https://rdr.kuleuven.be/) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12 When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS ’. Upon publication of the relevant research results Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS . IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED , THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED . DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT . EXAMPLE ANSWER : E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS .” 7 - Data : CC-BY 4.0 - Code : GNU GPLv3 Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here . INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA . ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes: a DOI will be added upon deposit in the data repository . What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Data sharing costs are minimal as access to the KU Leuven’s Research Data Repository is provided at no additional cost for academic purposes . 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13 7.
