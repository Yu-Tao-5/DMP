It is a challenging problem due to the presence of a multitude of sound transmission \npaths across junctions of building elements, also called flanking transmission paths. The  current \ntechnological options are often inadequate, especially during renovation and in lightweight,  more \nsustainable buildings. New, more flexible, more robust and more affordable solutions are  urgently needed.  \n \nIn this PhD project, such solutions will be developed through basic research on engineered  metamaterial \nstructures with unprecedented vibration attenuation properties. The main idea is to add  small resonant \nstructures in a dense grid to building elements that make up a junction through which problematic \ntransmission occurs. This minimally intrusive, add -on solution only needs to be applied in the immediate \nvicinity of the junctions. Its development will involve the realization of three  breakthroughs: resonant \nmetamaterial treatments that are effective over wide frequency bands,  efficient numerical simulation tools \nfor partially treated building elements and for flanking sound transmission through junctions of such \nelements, and a system -oriented approach for the optimized design of the metamaterial solutions. In order \nto showcase the potential of the proposed solution, a  pioneering demonstrator case will also be developed \nand experimentally validated.  \n \n       \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        4 \n 2.

If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data. ☒ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☒ Personal network drive (I -drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on -premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☒ Other: Teams -Site, Physical prototypes will be stored at the KU Leuven Laboratory of Acoustics , or at the Structural Mechanics Section How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? ☒ Standard back -up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back -ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If no, please specify : FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10 How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . Guidance on security for research data The access to KU Leuven OneDrive and shared network drives is secured by KU Leuven authentication. The KU Leuven Laboratory of Acoustics, where physical prototypes will be stored, requires badge access. Furthermore, the prototypes will be stored in secured and locked spaces. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The available free space provid ed by KU Leuven on OneDrive and Teams -site should be sufficient . No specific costs are foreseen for the storage of the physical prototypes in the KU Leuven Laboratory of Acoustics . 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). Guidance on data preservation ☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy (digital data) ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be ke pt for 10 years (explain) Physical prototypes can be preserved in the KU Leuven Laboratory of Acoustics for at least 1 year. Preservation for up to 5 years will be evaluated based on the storage capacity of the laboratory. If this is not possible, as a backup plan, detailed drawings, reports and instructions will be preserved as digital data, to allow for the replication of the prototypes. Prof. Edwin Reynders will have access to all generated data also after the project. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11 Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive K U Leuven storage guide . ☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☒ Shared network drive (J- drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): Physical prototypes will be stored in the KU Leuven Laboratory of Acoustics. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The available free space provid ed by KU Leuven on OneDrive and Teams -site should be sufficient . No specific costs are foreseen for the storage of the physical prototypes in the KU Leuven Laboratory of Acoustics . 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE ’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE , CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY . AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS . FOR MORE INFORMATION : HTTPS ://WIKI.SURFNET .NL/DISPLAY /STANDARDS /INFO-EU- REPO /#INFOEUREPO -ACCESS RIGHTS ☐ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☒ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: The datasets might be used for research collaboration purposes with other researchers during the project. The most relevant datasets will be available for further research activities within the Structural Mechanics Section after the project ends. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Prof. Edwin Reynders will have access to all datasets after the project. The most relevant datasets will be made available for all members of the Structural Mechanics Section. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12 Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify : Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. ☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Other data repository (specify) ☐ Other (specify) When will the data be made available? ☐ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☒ Other : after publication and upon request and agreement with research collaborators Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS .
