The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Lisa Ehlers, ORCID 0000-0001-8737-001X\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles\nProject number1 & title Understanding ADA2 deficiency on a cellular level\nFunder(s) GrantID211E0123N\nAffiliation(s) x KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nProvide ROR3 identifier when possible:  05f950310 (KU Leuven), 03qtxy027 (FWO)\nPlease provide a short project description 2  ( 2)           ADA deficiency DADA is a monogenic disease caused by biallelic mutations in the\n2       -     ADA gene that presents with vasculopathy and haemato immunological symptoms as well\n      .     2  as an increased type I interferon signature The cellular pathophysiology of DADA is\n .poorly understood\n  ,     2        In this project I aim to characterise DADA on a cellular level and analyse cellular\n disturbances in\n    2       .the presence of mutant ADA in the context of the underlying genotype\n  ,   ( .)       2     To this end I will I create a thorough data set of DADA patients uniting information on\n,         2 , ( .) genotype in vitro characteristics and clinical manifestations of different ADA variants II\n       -    2,  characterise the subcellular localisation and trafficking of wild type and mutant ADA and\n( .)           2 III examine the role of proteotoxic stress and defective autophagy in DADA\n. pathophysiology\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

    "clean_full_text": "FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 1FWO DMP Template - Flemish Standard Data Management Plan Project supervisors (from application round 2018 onwards) and fellows (from application round 2020 onwards) will, upon being awarded their project or fellowship, be invited to develop their answers to the data management related questions into a DMP. The FWO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.

If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3.Documentation and Metadata FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded).Every lab member of the inborn errors of immunity lab has an account of the electronic lab book provider LabArchives. LabArchives is used for detailed documentation of all experiments including date of experiment, samples used, patient-derived material (anonymised using lab codes), reference and lot numbers of used reagents. The names of the corresponding files containing the experiments’ results will be listed for every performed experiment to ensure traceability. Detailed sample documentation is available in the lab’s shared folder on the KU Leuven shared drive (J: GBW-0496_Inborn_Errors_Immunolgy) including lab codes and localisation in the respective fridges, freezers and tanks. A uniform labelling system is in place for patient-derived material. For specific experiments, label legend are provided in the researchers’ lab books. Standard operating procedures are in place for all protocols regularly used in the lab. They have been verified by to independent researchers and are stored in the lab’s shared LabArchives notebook. A back-up of the protocols is kept on the J: drive. Code used to analyse transcriptomics and proteomics data is documented by the lab’s bioinformatician and stored on an internal lab website to ensure lasting transparency. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: For every analysed sample the following information are documented in the researcher’s LabArchives notebook and in excel sheets on the shared lab folder (J: drive): lab code, sample type, date, stimulating condition. Detailed information on the experimental procedures used to generate and process the samples will be available in the LabArchives entry of the respective experiment or by reference to the used SOP where applicable. For samples sent out for analysis, excel sheets containing the sample information and used sample identifiers are kept in the shared J: folder. Mass spectrometry data will be deposited for open access to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 124.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Observational and experimental data is stored in respective project folders on the shared drive (J:) of the inborn errors of immunity lab (GBW-0496_Inborn_Errors_Immunolgy). The shared folder contains project folders with subfolder dedicated to the different work packages and individual experiments. Large data sets (i.e. bulk RNA-sequencing, proteomics) are stored on the Large storage (L:). Additionally, OneDrive is used to synchronise data between different computers and instruments in the laboratory to allow for easy data exchange. For storage of physical samples, there is storage capacity in the lab (4 fridges, 5 freezers at -20°C, 1 freezer at -80°C, 1 liquid nitrogen tank). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.Data backup is provided by the KU Leuven IT department. Backups of project data stored via the KU Leuven network are generated using snapshot technology. The following backup regimes are in place for the respective folders: KU Leuven shared drives (J:) -Backups are made using “snapshot” technology, which is the online storage of incremental data changes. -An hourly backup (at 8 AM, 12 PM, 4 PM and 8 PM) the last 6 of which are stored on our servers -A daily backup, at midnight, the last 6 of which are stored on our servers -A weekly backup, Saturday night at midnight, the last 12 of which are stored on our servers KU Leuven Large Storage (L:) Automatic version management of the files. Version management is done using \"snapshot\" technology, where the previous versions of the changed files are kept online in a snapshot on the same storage system. -by default, 1 snapshot is taken daily and is kept for 14 days. So you can go back to previous versions of the file up to 14 days. -end users can restore older files themselves from within their Windows PC via the \"previous versions | previous versions\" functionality. For non-digital data, loss of samples is prevented by connection of the lab’s large freezing devices to the KU Leuven surveillance system. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: OneDrive: 2 TB / researcher Shared drive (J:): 1 TB Large storage (L:): 5 TB If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7Data security on KU Leuven servers including OneDrive, shared drives and large storage options is guaranteed by ICTS to be suitable for public, confidential and strictly confidential data. The OneDrive folders are additionally protected by multifactor authentication with the KU Leuven Authenticator app. For additional data security, all patient information are saved in an anonymized manner using the laboratory’s lab code system. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?KU Leuven provides free access to OneDrive for staff and students. The inborn errors of immunity lab has purchased the following storage options on the KU Leuven network: Large storage: € 569 / year for 5 TB storage Shared drive: € 519 / year for 1 TB storage Costs for data storage and backup are covered by the ERC Grant “MORE2ADA2”. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 155.
