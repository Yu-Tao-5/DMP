Although originating from distant geographical areas, isolates that\ndegrade the same pesticide, display basically similar catabolic pathways and genes, although\nwith differences in gene sequence and organization. The questions are whether such genotypes\nemerged independently and/or whether they spread and further evolved from a few places and\nhow their genetic make-up and evolution contributed to their distribution. Due to the limited\nnumber of isolates from a limited number of locations and the fact that only information is\navailable from cultured strains, these questions can currently not be answered. This project will\ndo so by interrogating the worldwide variation of the tfd genotype that encodes for the\ncatabolism of the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoacetic acid (2,4-D) using culture-dependent and\nculture independent approaches. It will be examined whether region-specific 2,4-D catabolic tfd\ngenotypes and profiles of global distribution and evolution can be recognized. This will be linked\nto biotic and abiotic soil parameters and climatic and anthropogenic parameters to infer the\nunderlying factors of emergence/ evolution/distribution of the tfd genotypes and the role of the\ntfd mak-up in global spread.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
