Documentation and Metadata\nDescribe the documentation that will be created for the data. This section deals with\nthe way in which you will document how the dataset was created and subsequently\nprocessed.\n1. The software model will be documented internally (in the software code) and a manual will be\ncreated.\n2.

Data selection and Preservation after Research\nWhat is the long-term preservation plan for these dataset(s)?\nThe dataset in itself is of limited value. The models and controllers will be stored on the research\nfacilities' central servers.\nData Selection: Which data will have long time value for the research and will be\npreserved?\nThe dataset in itself is of limited value and might not be stored for the long-term.

There are no IP concerns with the data. Are the collected data considered to be \"data containing personal informationâ€​ and are all the requirements about the collection of these data met? The data are not considered to be \"data containing personal information\". 4. Data storage and Backup during Research How and where will the data be stored during research? Centrally on storage facilities of the research unit ESAT digital data storage devices and servers are located in the ESAT computer room, which is physically secured with limited access for IT personnel only. This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 1 of 3 The digital data are stored on a SAN (Hitachi G350). Two physical servers access the SAN and make the data available to client computers on the ESAT network via: SMB2 (or higher) from specific IP ranges NFSv4 from specific (IT managed) systems Which back-up procedures are in place? The data is backed up daily, on tapes. The data is also replicated to an off-site storage system - SAN (Hitachi G350) - housed in the ICTS data center. For more on backup retrieval see https://wiki.esat.kuleuven.be/it/BackupAndRecovery Describe the data security procedures and who has access to the data. The ESAT IT system group operates in accordance with the ICT security standards of the KU Leuven ('KU Leuven ICT Informatieveiligheidsstandaarden'). If required for the project and agreed by the ESAT IT system group, specific access control can deployed, e.g.: data is stored on a file server where access is regulated using an access control list (ACL) that grants: read-write access to the project owner read-only access to specific users The ACL is managed by the project owner. 5. Data selection and Preservation after Research What is the long-term preservation plan for these dataset(s)? The dataset in itself is of limited value. The models and controllers will be stored on the research facilities' central servers. Data Selection: Which data will have long time value for the research and will be preserved? The dataset in itself is of limited value and might not be stored for the long-term. The models and controllers will be stored on the research facilities' central servers. 6. Data Sharing Are there any restrictions for sharing the data? No. If there are no restrictions, which mechanisms will be in place to assure that the data are discoverable, accessible and intelligible? / How will you share the data? Repository Website Models and controllers can be shared via Github. This will depend on the follow-up of the CELSA project, e.g., if there will be a follow-up in a European project or not. With whom will the data be shared? On request with peers only The models and controllers will be shared within the current CELSA consortium (University of Ljubljana, Budapest University of Technology and Economics) and may be shared with future project partners within a broader European collaboration. 7. Responsabilities and Resources Who is responsible for Data Management during the project? This will be the person who might receive questions on the data management aspects of the research project.
