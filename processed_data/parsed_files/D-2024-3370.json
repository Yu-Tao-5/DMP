It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all materials that need proper management because they are valuable, difficult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentation/metadata. RDM Guidance on data If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type.

RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .I document each dataset with the following documentation: README.md files: each dataset (both raw and processed) has a README file that describes the goal and use of data generation, the work package to which the dataset belongs, and any instructions on how to obtain the code from the original sources and how to replicate the results, as well as using the data. Data dictionary/code book: a comprehensive data dictionary (maintained in an .xlsx file) and a codebook (maintained in a .md file) detail the name of all files where the data is stored; the name of the variables, their definitions, and types (binary, integer, string, etc.); and unique identifiers or unique data id keys that are common across datasets. In-code documentation: all code used for data analysis and transformation will be documented in- file with detail, adding key comments at each particular step. A header section will outline the goal of the code through a short description, the input data sources, key steps /transformations conducted in the code, and all output datasets/files produced by the code. I will use the following folder structure: Archive: obsolete data/code which merits storage. Data: contains the data dictionary and an individual folder for each dataset. In each dataset folder, the structure is: oCode: the code files used for data transformation, numbered with the order of execution and following standard naming conventions. oDocs: relevant documentation/methodology/communication with the statistical agencies. oInput: raw datasets. oOutput: processed datasets. oTmp: temporary data files generated by the code. oA README file and a main executable file for the code. Tasks: contains folders (with order of execution) indicating the transformations/analysis made in the project. In each task folder, the structure will be: oCode: the code files used for data transformation, numbered with the order of execution and following standard naming conventions. oDocs: relevant documentation/methodology. oOutput: output generated by the task (figures, tables, derived datasets). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10oTmp: temporary data files generated by the code. oResults: a LaTex document indicating the results/analysis conducted in the particular task. oA main executable file for the code. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: Metadata standards: Yes, I will use a DataCite Metadata Schema for dataset-level metadata to ensure that the datasets are findable and executable. I will maintain all data dictionaries and codebooks regularly updated, clearly indicating the data keys (= variables defining dimensions of dataset/unique identifiers), in accordance to FAIR principles. Controlled vocabularies and ontologies: I will use standard ontologies to (macro) economics, as recommended by the FAIR principles (main reference: Gentzkow, M., & Shapiro, J. M. (2014). Code and data for the social sciences: A practitioner’s guide. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago) If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data.☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☒ Digital Vault ☐ Other: How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? ☒ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☒ Personal back-ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) I will automatically back up the data on a regular schedule using the institutional backup system, ensuring that the latest version is always securely stored. Code files documenting the transformation of the raw data to processed data will be version-controlled using GitHub, stored online, and made publicly available together with the published papers. This also ensures that changes can be reverted if necessary, preventing data loss due to accidental modifications. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If no, please specify: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data My data are not private/confidential and as such do not require special security measures. However, I will follow the following standards of network and computer security: Data transfers occur only using secure protocols (HTTPS, SFTP). I only access the data from my KU Leuven device, using my network firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Access to data is controlled via two-factor authentication, and only I and my supervisor prof. Christian Proebsting have write or modification access. My device follows regular software updates and antivirus protections. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?The OneDrive license we will use is free for KU Leuven staff members. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?There are no costs expected for the data preservation. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY.
