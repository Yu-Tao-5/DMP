This so-called vampire energy can be higher than the energy that the device\nconsumes in its operational mode due to the long standby time and the short active mode for\ntypical applications. We propose a solution that is based on a CMOS chip, which is intrinsically\nsmall, cheap and low-power. Based on previous research performed in MICAS, we will develop a\nGeneric ARchitecture for a Low-loss Integrated Converter, or GARLIC, eliminating the vampire\nenergy in electronic devices and appliances by taking care of the power supply in the standby\nmode. The scientific challenges that need to be tackled during the project are mainly the\ncompatibility of the CMOS chip with the high input voltage and the capacity to deliver enough\noutput power for a large variety of applications. We have already proven the basic concepts that\nhelp answer these challenges, but in GARLIC, we will evolve towards the full system level and\ntowards the validation in a demo setting. \nWe will validate our research by realizing a hardware\nset-up, with an innovative chip at its core.
