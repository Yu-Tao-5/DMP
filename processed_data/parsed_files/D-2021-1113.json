Millions of women ingest synthetic sex hormones to control their fertility, for\nmenstrual and menopausal problems, to assist conception, as abortifacients, and for other\nreasons. In our collective memory, the rise of hormones mostly counts as a positive\ndevelopment, giving rise to womenâ€™s emancipation and sexual liberation. Yet there also\nexists a popular counter-narrative, in which the widespread consumption of hormones is seen as\nan unethical experiment that damages womenâ€™s health for the benefit of industry and the\nmale medical establishment. Both these narratives lack nuance. Yet whereas scholars have\ncorrected the idea that the pill spawned a sexual revolution, they have neglected the more\nsinister side of this history. The rise of hormones was unprecedented both in terms of its rapidity\nand range, but we know very little about the wider handling of their possible sideeffects. This\nproject studies how the risks of hormones in Belgium were managed by five actors: the regulator,\nthe pharmaceutical industry, the medical community, the womenâ€™s movement and the\npatientsâ€™ rights movement. Going beyond the history of oral contraceptives, from the\ndiethylstilbestrol (DES) scandal to the morning-after pill, this project will produce the first\nmonograph recounting the interwoven histories of hormones and their hazards, from their\ncommercialisation in the 1940s up to the present day.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. General Information\nName applicant\nTinne Claes\nFWO Project Number & Title\n12I9322N: The Hazards of Hormones: Risk, Regulation and Women’s Health in\nthe History of Hormones in Belgium\nAffiliation\nKU Leuven\n2. Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nThis project collects or generates two types of sources: textual and audio/audiovisual. The textual\nsources will be diverse, consisting of both archival and published sources, for example, minutes\nof\nmeetings, compendia of pharmaceutical products, correspondence, etcetera. All documents will\nbe\nscanned and digitised, using OCR to turn them into .txt-files. This will not require a lot of storage\nspace: taking my previous research project as a point of reference, I will collect approximately\n100GB\nof textual data. The generated audio and audiovisual sources, namely oral history interviews, will\nbe\nkept as .wav-files, which together will be circa 150GB large.\n3. Legal and ethical issues\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 4\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nYes\nPrivacy Registry Reference: (\nG-2022-5264\n)\nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used: The oral history interviews may\ncontain personal/emotional testimonies.\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nYes\nI have submitted this project for ethical review (\nG-2022-5264\n), but have not yet received a\ndecision.\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nFor the interviews, details on the setting of the interviews, the informed consent process, the\nsubjects discussed and the instructions given to interviewers will be documented in a Word\ndocument. Also steps taken to remove direct identifiers in the data will be described.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nDuring the project, I will make use of the OneDrive cloud service provided by the Faculty of Arts\nat KU Leuven (2 TB storage, free of charge). This storage space is safe and automatically backed\nup, and allows for extra protection of sensitive data. Concretely, I use the Multi Factor\nAuthentication and Conditional Access functions, so that I alone may access the data before\nanonymisation. I will anonymise the interviews with Cubase, distorting the voice and ‘bleeping’\nany identifiable information. \nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic daily back-up\nprocedures.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\n2 TB storage is enough for this project.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project?

How\nwill these costs be covered?\nThe OneDrive cloud service is provided by the Faculty of Arts at KU Leuven, free of charge.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nSince we will be working with sensitive personal data that will only be anonymised at the end of\nthe project, the data will be stored in the university's secure environment for private data. I use\nthe Multi Factor Authentication and Conditional Access functions.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nI use personal and/or sensitive data. I will deviate from the principle of preservation of data\nand/or the minimum preservation term only when legally required to do so, concretely, when\ninterviewees do not give their informed consent for the preservation of oral history interviews or\npersonal archives.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures)\nfor at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nAs mentioned above, I will make use of ‘Archive storage’ at KU Leuven after the project. The cost\nfor this (€75/500GB per year) will be covered with the bench fee.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nYes. Specify:\nThe data will be destroyed at the end of the project if the participants have not given consent for\nthe data to be kept beyond the project.\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nAll interviews, with the informed consent of the interviewees, will be kept in an oral history\nrepository (working title ‘Hormone Stories’) at the archives for women’s history AVG Carhif in\nBrussels (http://www.avg-carhif.be/). Copies of the collected textual sources will also be given to,\ninventoried by and kept at, the patient organisation DES in Belgium\n(http://www.desinbelgium.be/).\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nOther (specify):\nSee question above.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nImmediately after the end of the project\nAfter an embargo period.
