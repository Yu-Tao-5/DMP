Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNo\n \nNA\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nNo\nIn WP5, I will use an animal model but one based on \nDrosophila melanogaster \nwhich is an\ninvertebrate of which the use is not subjected to ethical clearance. \nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\nNA\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nYes\nDepending on the material requested from other labs, MTAs might need to be signed. This will\nalways be in agreement with KU Leuven/VIB legal department to minimize resistrictions on the\nuse of the material/data. \n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nMost, if not all data files will be named using \"yearmonthday_briefTitleOrDescription\". All\nexperiments are preformed using an SOP, which is stored/shared in a group OneNote notebook.\nFurthermore, a digital notebook in OneNote is used to register day-by-day activities in the lab or\nat the computer.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 7\nFor .txt, .csv, .xlsx files containing tabular information, extra tabs or a head text section will be\nused to explain the data, the meaning of the columns etc. For file types that do not allow such\nadditional annotation data, a readme file will be saved in the same directory of the datafiles to\nexplain all the various data files and give a broad overview of the analyses steps. \nMost if not all analyses will be performed in R (or preferably similar open-source software like\nPython), making use of analysis scripts per type of analyses/research question. These scripts will\nbe annotated with comments and section heads to explain the various steps and outcomes. For\nfinal outcomes, I will make use of a result-embedded markdown file, combining code with\noutcomes. \nVarious data types (e.g. .fastq, .nd2, .tiff, ...) come wih their own metadata containing technical\ninformation about settings, machine types, pixel density, resolution, channels,... These data files\nwill be preserved with their original metadata and some of these metadata will be used/accessed\nwithin the analyses scripts. \nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nYes\nNo\nFor data files that come with their own, standard metadata (.nd2 files follow the Nikon metadata\nstandards, .fastq NGS files contain standard metadata on sequencing technique), I will preserve\nsuch metadata. Upon storing some data in publicly available repositories, their metadata will be\nfollowed (e.g. SRA database for NGS data). \nDepending on the specific experiment type, I will store minimal required information in the text\nheaders or separate tabs, to explain the conditions of the experiment. For example, for the\nantibiotic sensitivity tests, it will contain the species name, strain name, mutation, antibiotic type\nand name, concentration, treatment duration, and type of plating assay. For microscopy and\ncytometry data, finalized data will be preserved along a metadata file describing relevant\nparameters for the experiment (species and strain name, mutation, time resolution, duration,\nchannels, exposure time, resolution, ...). \n \n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nData will be generally stored in two or more locations. For small-volume datasets (i.e., tabular\ndata of antibiotic survival), data will be stored on the device where the data is generated (and/or\nthe attached network drives), my personal laptop and a onedrive/sharepoint location. Off-site\nbackups will be frequently made using two external hard drive copies, each on a different\nlocation. \nA network drive will be used for large-scale data (e.g. NGS data and microscopy data). A copy of\nthese datasets will be made to desktop pc's with large computational power (or to the computing\ncluster of KU Leuven) whenever data analyses will be performed. \nFor final datasets that are part of publications or manuscripts posted on preprint servers,\ndatasets will be deposited in publicly available repositories. Depending on the data type, this\ncould be the SRA depository (for NGS data), KU Leuven's own data repository (RDR), Mendeley\nData,... and, whenever possible or required, data will also be fully shared via the publisher's\nwebsite. \nScripts and code will be stored (and shared after reaching a finality) via Github. \nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe use of Onedrive/sharepoint is backed up via a local copy and a (back-up) copy in the\ncloud/on the KU leuven network and offers version control to allow easy recovery in case of\nmistakes. Similarly, network drives of KU Leuven follow daily back-up procedures and offer\nversion control via the built-in features of Windows. In case of more severe data loss or damage,\nOneDrive allows a swift recovery of data on a separate machine. The IT support at KU Leuven\nsimilarly can easily recover data when network drives fail. \nFor off-site backups of my personal system using external hard drives, I make use of\nSyncBackFree software once a month which offers a more long-term backup in case of long-term\nmalfunctioning or infections. \nGithub-stored code and scripts are backed-up in the cloud, and also offers a version control. \nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n5 of 7\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nOneDrive at KU Leuven alone already offers 5TB of data per user. Network storage is purchased\non a group level and increased whenever needed. Github space is currently free of charge and\nonly requires small volumes. External hard drives are cheap for large volumes and are readily\navailable in the lab. \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nTwo external HDD were bought on my benchfee. Network/cloud based storage is covered by the\nhost lab and organized on a lab/centre level to which each personal contributes a small yearly\nfee (in my case, through my benchfee). \nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nBefore reaching a finalized stage, access to data will be secured since data on the network drives\nare stored in\nthe university's secure environment. OneDrive storage is linked to my personal secured KU\nLeuven account. Both are secured by a two factor authorization and frequently changed\npasswords. External HDD are stored in the safety of my home (copy 1) and the lab (copy 2). \nUpon sharing data (when finalized or during collaborations), academic licenses or DTA/MTA will\nbe put in place which ensure a proper level of security for the use of the data. We will publish\nopen-access provide a free sharing of data at this point to properly educated people. \n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nData will be stored for 5 years (and longer, complying with the 10 year data preservation rule of\nKU Leuven) except: \nmaterial that is non-essential to finalized products (e.g. papers): NGS CRISPRiSeq libraries,\nDNA oligonucleotides, intermediary steps of mutants that were constructed and used. \npublically available data (e.g. DNA sequences to which our data was compared to). \nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nFor long-term storage, published data will be stored on the network drive and made publically\navailable alongside the publication (if possible) and in a public data repository like Mendeley\nData and KU Leuven's RDR. For specific datasets, specialized data repositories will be used (SRA\ndatabase of NGS data). \nUnpublished but essential data (and similarly the essential and published data) will be stored on\nthe university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for at least 10 years,\nconform the KU Leuven RDM policy.\n \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nTo store the essential data for 5-10 years, I will make use of publicly and free repositories\n(published data) and of the KU Leuven long-term, large-volume central storage servers\n(estimated cost of 100 eur per year). \n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nNo\nAt this moment, no 3rd partie agreements impose a legal restriction of the use/sharing of data.\nWhenever we request data or collaborate, we aim to keep restriction as low as possible, in\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n6 of 7\nagreement with our legal department. \nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nFull datasets, metadata and analyses scripts, will be uploaded alongside the publication\nwhenever possible and uploaded in a data repository (e.g. KU Leuven RDR or others) in all cases. \nUnpublished, essential data will be available to (future) lab members via internal IT provisions. \nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn an Open Access repository\nIn a restricted access repository\nFinal, published datasets will be made available (publicly) for reuse via the KU Leuven RDR\nplatform and the SRA repository (for NGS data)\nWhen will the data be made available?\nAfter an embargo period. Specify the length of the embargo and why this is necessary\nUpon publication of the research results\nUnpublished data will be embergoed for public access for another 5 years to allow the research\ngroup to publish research findings. \nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nPublished data will be available to anyone for any purpose, provided that they give appropriate\ncredit to the creators. Unpublished data will be availabe for everyone with permission, which is\neveryone with access to the server of the lab (= employee of Centre for Microbiology and Plant\nGenetics (CMPG))\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nThe chosen online repository will be free of charge, network storage at KU Leuven comes with a\ncost of 100 eur per Tb per year, covered by the host lab after termination of the project. \n8. Responsibilities\nWho will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?\nBram Van den Bergh\nWho will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nBram Van den Bergh\nWho will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ?\nBram Van den Bergh\nWho bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nThe PI bears the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n7 of 7"

In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...). Data will be stored for 5 years (and longer, complying with the 10 year data preservation rule of KU Leuven) except: material that is non-essential to finalized products (e.g. papers): NGS CRISPRiSeq libraries, DNA oligonucleotides, intermediary steps of mutants that were constructed and used. publically available data (e.g. DNA sequences to which our data was compared to). Where will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)? For long-term storage, published data will be stored on the network drive and made publically available alongside the publication (if possible) and in a public data repository like Mendeley Data and KU Leuven's RDR. For specific datasets, specialized data repositories will be used (SRA database of NGS data). Unpublished but essential data (and similarly the essential and published data) will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered? To store the essential data for 5-10 years, I will make use of publicly and free repositories (published data) and of the KU Leuven long-term, large-volume central storage servers (estimated cost of 100 eur per year). 7. Data sharing and reuse Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? No At this moment, no 3rd partie agreements impose a legal restriction of the use/sharing of data. Whenever we request data or collaborate, we aim to keep restriction as low as possible, in This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 6 of 7 agreement with our legal department. Which data will be made available after the end of the project? Full datasets, metadata and analyses scripts, will be uploaded alongside the publication whenever possible and uploaded in a data repository (e.g. KU Leuven RDR or others) in all cases. Unpublished, essential data will be available to (future) lab members via internal IT provisions. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? In an Open Access repository In a restricted access repository Final, published datasets will be made available (publicly) for reuse via the KU Leuven RDR platform and the SRA repository (for NGS data) When will the data be made available? After an embargo period. Specify the length of the embargo and why this is necessary Upon publication of the research results Unpublished data will be embergoed for public access for another 5 years to allow the research group to publish research findings. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? Published data will be available to anyone for any purpose, provided that they give appropriate credit to the creators. Unpublished data will be availabe for everyone with permission, which is everyone with access to the server of the lab (= employee of Centre for Microbiology and Plant Genetics (CMPG)) What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered? The chosen online repository will be free of charge, network storage at KU Leuven comes with a cost of 100 eur per Tb per year, covered by the host lab after termination of the project. 8. Responsibilities Who will be responsible for data documentation & metadata? Bram Van den Bergh Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project? Bram Van den Bergh Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ? Bram Van den Bergh Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP? The PI bears the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP. This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 7 of 7"
