The F WO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official  start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO \nbut to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel.  Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.  \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation  Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives  of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions.  This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary  of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.  \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   2 \n 1.

Our preliminary data indicate that  \ncrosstalk between fibroblasts and myeloid cells promotes chronic inflammati on during IBD. These  \nfibroblasts have a hyperactivated phenotype and are capable of recruiting inflammatory myeloid cells  \nfurther fuelling local tissue inflammation. Thus, we propose that targeting activated fibroblasts and  \nblocking their crosstalk with pr o-inflammatory macrophages will halt the perpetuation of chronic  \nintestinal inflammation, as well as the development of tissue remodelling. The first aim of this project  \nis to disentangle this complex network of pro -inflammatory and pro -fibrotic mechanisms  by which  \nfibroblasts modulate intestinal inflammation and tissue damage. Secondly, we aim to identify the  \nmolecular pathways responsible for the crosstalk between activated fibroblasts and pro -inflammatory  \nmyeloid cells in chronic intestinal inflammation.  Overall, my project will identify novel cellular  \nmechanisms that are pivotal during chronic intestinal inflammation. Revealing how distinct fibroblast  \npopulations exert their pro -inflammatory and pro -fibrotic actions will suggest novel targets and  \ntherapies for preventing excessive tissue remodelling in patients with IBD.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   4 \n  \n4 Add rows for each dataset you want to describe.  2.

The respective \ncentre responsible for collection and storage of human body material (UZ Leuven Biobank) and next -\ngeneration  sequenc ing (Genomics Core UZ Leuven) have implemented quality manuals and quality control \nprocedures available.  Readme files with information on methodology, an overview of the dataset, data \nsources, data collection methods, codebooks, data cleaning, analysis, va riable definitions , and, units of \nmeasurement will be provided. If any data transformation steps or workflows were utilized during the \nanalysis, these would be also documented and shared. Detailed documentation of the analysis methodology \nwould be provided , including the statistical techniques, models, or algorithms employed. We will use \nrepositories in GitLab and GitHub which will also ensure reuse and version control.  The provenance of the \ndata be thoroughly documented using the appropriate standards. The  data will be accompanied by context \non how they are captured, processed, analysed , and validated and other information that enables \ninterpretation and re -use. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   13 \n All personally identifiable information is replaced by a unique study identifier / Persistent Ide ntifier for each \npatient and each biological sample. The subject identification log, linking the identifiers to the participant’s \nname, will be only kept in the site’s regulatory binder and only accessible by the treating physician s (Prof. \nSéverine Vermeir e, Dr. Bram Verstockt, UZ Leuven). This log will allow proper monitoring of the clinical \nrecords and by the appointed monitors to assure completeness, accuracy and correctness of the data \ncollected at the site. Clinical reports necessary for remote source data verification will be de -identified, \ncoded with the personal identifiers and electronically transmitted to the partners. No personally identifiable \ninformation will be at any time shared. Deposited datasets will be identified with a persistent identifi er \nwhen applicable, such as a DOI, both in preprint and publication.  \nMetadata that will be created includes but is not limited to image information, protocols, device \ninformation, data units, species taxon identifiers and gene identifiers.  We will use the Research Data \nRepository (RDR)  of KU Leuven (https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr) or European Genome -phenome \nArchive (EGA)(https://ega -archive.org/). A metadata standard is automatically applied upon depositing the \ndata. The metadata model  will include fields that are required, recommended and optional. Using this data \nrepository, the data sets will be findable and reusable. We will follow the applicable standard FAIR \nprinciples, Findable -Accessible -Interoperable -Reusable, mentioned in fair sharing.org. Keywords are \nprovided through the RDR repository system and EGA repository system. The assignation of keywords to \neach dataset and subsets will facilitate their re -use. We will try to balance the trade -off between keywords \nthat are very specif ic to increase findability, but also more generalized so that it can be found in broader \nsearches.  \nAfter uploading a file, the RDR repository gives the option to add a ReadMe file and add 'file metadata' to \neach file. The metadata in RDR is always publicly  available after the reviewer has approved the dataset, even \nwith restricted or embargoed files. Metadata makes our dataset findable and is therefore essential to make \nour data FAIR. The metadata deposited in EGA can also be harvested and indexed.  \nUpon the  completion of the project, the data will be made freely available in the public domain  with \nrestricted access for data from patients and human tissues . For storage and sharing, we will ensure \ncompliance with GDPR, and will use trusted European repositorie s such as RDR or EGA.  Metadata will be \nmade openly available and licensed under a public domain dedication open licenses (Creative Commons \nAttribution International Public License (CC BY)).   \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   14 \n Will a metadata standard be used to make it \neasier to find and reuse the data ?  \n \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard \nwill be used.

We will contact the data access committee (dac@uzleuven.be) before \ndepositing. At the end of the project, the data may be also deposited in domain specific domain -specific \nrepos itories such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). RDR \nuses digital object identifier (DOI). EGA also provides the submitters with stable, globally unique identifiers \nto enable reference of datasets in publications and across genomics infrastructures.  A metadata standard is \nautomatically applied upon depositing the data . We will follow community -endorsed interoperability best \npractices that are relevant to our discipline. The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable , and Reusable) \nprinciples will be followed to make data findable using persistent identifiers, which will ensure data \naccessibility and reusability with clear and standardized metadata, through open licenses and data formats  \n(https://fairsharing.org/  )  \nExample:  \nSequencing : MINISEQE (  https://fairsharing.org/MINSEQE 2 ) \nFlow cytometry: MIFlowCyt (  https://fairsharing.org/MIFlowCyt  ) \nImmunohistochemistry: OME ( https://fairsharing.org/OME ) \nThe metadata model will include fields that are required, recommended , and optional. Using this data \nrepository, the data sets will be findable and reusable.  \nAll descriptors will be given in a language that can be understood across multiple disciplines to reach the \nbroader scientific community.

We will use shared vocabularies and ontologies to promote data \ninteroperability.   In the case of usage of uncommon or generated  project -specific  ontologies or vocabularies, \nclear descri ptions and easily accessible mappings to more commonly used ontologies will be provided.  The \ngenerated ontologies or vocabularies will be openly published to allow reusing, refining or extending them.  \nThe references will  also be included wherever applicab le in a standardized and acceptable manner.  \nText documents and Excel files stored within each experiment folder in the J -Drive  or L -Drive  will \nrespectively contain guidelines describing data collection/analysis methods and all relevant  metadata  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   15 \n  \n (including experimental conditions, sample keys, computational analysis pipelines and  their parameters) to \nensure the reusability of the data and the reproducibility of any further data  generation.  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   16 \n  \n7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric:  https://osf.io/2z5g3/  4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project  \n \nWhere will the data be stored?  Upon data collection/pre -processing, data will be stored in the J -Drive  or L-Drive  of our  research unit. These \nservers are centrally managed by ICTS KU Leuven and ha ve back -up capacities (KU Leuven enterprise box,  \nLarge  volume -storage) . Temporary copies of the data will be made and kept on personal hard drives  if \nnecessary . Metadata will be made openly available and licensed under a public domain dedication open \nlicenses (Creative Commons Attribution International Public License (CC  BY)).  \nBoth EGA and RDR ensures long term storage. KU Leuven RDR ensures storage for at least 10 years. \nHowever, it is possible to request that the data be kept for a longer period of time (such as 20 -25 years for \nmedical fields). FAIR principle A2 states that metadata should persist even when the data are no longer \nsustained. In addition, data will be available in easily accessible form, e.g., pdf, excel files. Relevant software \nand coding details will made available via the use of repository such as GitLa b and GitHub, which will also \nensure reuse and version control.  \nHow will the data be backed up?  \n \nWHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO \nPREVENT DATA LOSS ?

The EGA provides a web -based portal and an API to enable data controllers to manage data access and \ntransfer permissions. Authorization infrastructure (AAI) management is vital for operating the EGA, where \na user's identity is verified before confirming ac cess rights to particular information. When a researcher logs \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   17 \n  \n \n  \nCLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , \nNETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND \nFILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND \nTRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 7 \n into the EGA website to access sensitive metadata, their credentials are authenticated. They can then \nbrowse a dataset of interest and request the download of sensitive data. If the researcher i s permitted to \naccess the dataset after the EGA validates their request, the request is approved, and they can retrieve the \ndata.  Regarding the data of patients or human tissue samples, the patient's name or other identifying \ninformation will be stored sep arately (site file) from their study data and replaced with a unique code to \nkeep the patient's identity secret. The subject identification log, linking the identifiers to the participant’s \nname, will be kept in the site’s regulatory binder and only access ible by the treating physician. Clinical \nreports necessary for remote source data verification will be de -identified, coded with the personal \nidentifiers and electronically transmitted to the partners. No personally identifiable information will be at \nany time shared.  \nFor personal data deposited in EGA and RDR that are not publicly accessible, access can be requested via \nthe designated data access committee.  \nData stored on KU Leuven -managed personal computers are protected via password access to  the \ncomputers, as set up by the KU Leuven IT Department. Off -site access to J -Drive  and L -Drive  data is  available  \nfrom KU Leuven personal computers and data access points and is password protected.  Upon request, \naccess to the shared drive will be given only to  authorized researchers.  \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?  The annual cost of J -Drive storage is €519 and L -Drive is €1 13.84 per 1TB of storage space per year. This  \ncost a nd capacity include the performance of mirror copies of the stored data, for safety backup purposes.  \nWe expect that 5 TB will be sufficient to store all data generated as part of the project. These  costs will be \ncovered by the budget of the project lead  (Prof. Gianluca Matteoli).  \n5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject  \n \nWhich data will be retained for at least five \nyears (or longer, in agreement with other \nretention policies that are applicable) after the All raw data will be retained for at least 5 years on the K -Drive storage space.

Metadata will be \nmade openly  available and licensed under a public domain dedication open licenses (Creative Commons \nAttribution International Public License (CC BY)).  The access for data from human tissue  will be restricted. \n end of the  project? In case some data cannot be \npreserved , clearly state the reasons for this  \n(e.g. legal or contract ual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). As stated in the ICF, all data are anonymized. These will be also preserved for the 5 -year period after end of  \nthis project. The generated data will be stored on designated KUL servers. Only in case of findings  which  \nhave direct implications for the health or disease status of the patient, the princip al investigator has the  \ncode to go back to the original patient, as also stipulated in the ICF. This code is stored on the hospital UZ  \nserver which is password prot ected and which also allows to consult the electronic medical chart of the  \npatient stored on UZ Leuven Hospital servers.  Also, Both EGA and RDR ensures long term storage. KU Leuven \nRDR ensures storage for at least 10 years. However, it is possible to reque st that the data be kept for a \nlonger period of time . \n \nWhere will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long -term)?  Long term data archives will be maintained in specific archive folders on the K -Drive.  With the server  \ncentrally managed by the ICTS , we will use the back -up possibilities as proposed by KU Leuven ICTS .  \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during the expected retention \nperiod? How will these costs be covered?  The annual cost of K -Drive storage is €5.69  per 100GB of storage space per year. We expect  that 5 TB  will \nbe sufficient for long -term storage of all data generated as part of the project.  These costs will be covered \nby the budget of the project lead (Prof.  Gianluca Matteoli ). \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   19 \n If access is restricted, please specify who will be \nable to access the data and under what \nconditions.

The F WO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.

Our preliminary data indicate that crosstalk between fibroblasts and myeloid cells promotes chronic inflammati on during IBD. These fibroblasts have a hyperactivated phenotype and are capable of recruiting inflammatory myeloid cells further fuelling local tissue inflammation. Thus, we propose that targeting activated fibroblasts and blocking their crosstalk with pr o-inflammatory macrophages will halt the perpetuation of chronic intestinal inflammation, as well as the development of tissue remodelling. The first aim of this project is to disentangle this complex network of pro -inflammatory and pro -fibrotic mechanisms by which fibroblasts modulate intestinal inflammation and tissue damage. Secondly, we aim to identify the molecular pathways responsible for the crosstalk between activated fibroblasts and pro -inflammatory myeloid cells in chronic intestinal inflammation. Overall, my project will identify novel cellular mechanisms that are pivotal during chronic intestinal inflammation. Revealing how distinct fibroblast populations exert their pro -inflammatory and pro -fibrotic actions will suggest novel targets and therapies for preventing excessive tissue remodelling in patients with IBD.

Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). Protocols and details related to data collection and processing will be recorded in Word or Excel files. Data folders containing raw and processed data will be hierarchically organized and labelled based on the source of the data, the type of experiment, the date of data generation, and the different experimental conditions analysed . Data analysis methods and part icularities (including metadata) will be described in text documents and Excel files included in these folders. All files will be stored in the J -Drive or L drive (KU Leven Storage space ). A readme file containing lab notes, SOPs of animal models and proto cols to process the tissue, SOPs of human data and processing of human tissue will always be kept together with the dataset. The respective centre responsible for collection and storage of human body material (UZ Leuven Biobank) and next - generation sequenc ing (Genomics Core UZ Leuven) have implemented quality manuals and quality control procedures available. Readme files with information on methodology, an overview of the dataset, data sources, data collection methods, codebooks, data cleaning, analysis, va riable definitions , and, units of measurement will be provided. If any data transformation steps or workflows were utilized during the analysis, these would be also documented and shared. Detailed documentation of the analysis methodology would be provided , including the statistical techniques, models, or algorithms employed. We will use repositories in GitLab and GitHub which will also ensure reuse and version control. The provenance of the data be thoroughly documented using the appropriate standards. The data will be accompanied by context on how they are captured, processed, analysed , and validated and other information that enables interpretation and re -use. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13 All personally identifiable information is replaced by a unique study identifier / Persistent Ide ntifier for each patient and each biological sample. The subject identification log, linking the identifiers to the participant’s name, will be only kept in the site’s regulatory binder and only accessible by the treating physician s (Prof. Séverine Vermeir e, Dr. Bram Verstockt, UZ Leuven). This log will allow proper monitoring of the clinical records and by the appointed monitors to assure completeness, accuracy and correctness of the data collected at the site. Clinical reports necessary for remote source data verification will be de -identified, coded with the personal identifiers and electronically transmitted to the partners. No personally identifiable information will be at any time shared. Deposited datasets will be identified with a persistent identifi er when applicable, such as a DOI, both in preprint and publication. Metadata that will be created includes but is not limited to image information, protocols, device information, data units, species taxon identifiers and gene identifiers. We will use the Research Data Repository (RDR) of KU Leuven (https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr) or European Genome -phenome Archive (EGA)(https://ega -archive.org/). A metadata standard is automatically applied upon depositing the data. The metadata model will include fields that are required, recommended and optional. Using this data repository, the data sets will be findable and reusable. We will follow the applicable standard FAIR principles, Findable -Accessible -Interoperable -Reusable, mentioned in fair sharing.org. Keywords are provided through the RDR repository system and EGA repository system. The assignation of keywords to each dataset and subsets will facilitate their re -use. We will try to balance the trade -off between keywords that are very specif ic to increase findability, but also more generalized so that it can be found in broader searches. After uploading a file, the RDR repository gives the option to add a ReadMe file and add 'file metadata' to each file. The metadata in RDR is always publicly available after the reviewer has approved the dataset, even with restricted or embargoed files. Metadata makes our dataset findable and is therefore essential to make our data FAIR. The metadata deposited in EGA can also be harvested and indexed. Upon the completion of the project, the data will be made freely available in the public domain with restricted access for data from patients and human tissues . For storage and sharing, we will ensure compliance with GDPR, and will use trusted European repositorie s such as RDR or EGA. Metadata will be made openly available and licensed under a public domain dedication open licenses (Creative Commons Attribution International Public License (CC BY)).

We will contact the data access committee (dac@uzleuven.be) before depositing. At the end of the project, the data may be also deposited in domain specific domain -specific repos itories such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). RDR uses digital object identifier (DOI). EGA also provides the submitters with stable, globally unique identifiers to enable reference of datasets in publications and across genomics infrastructures. A metadata standard is automatically applied upon depositing the data . We will follow community -endorsed interoperability best practices that are relevant to our discipline. The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable , and Reusable) principles will be followed to make data findable using persistent identifiers, which will ensure data accessibility and reusability with clear and standardized metadata, through open licenses and data formats (https://fairsharing.org/ ) Example: Sequencing : MINISEQE ( https://fairsharing.org/MINSEQE 2 ) Flow cytometry: MIFlowCyt ( https://fairsharing.org/MIFlowCyt ) Immunohistochemistry: OME ( https://fairsharing.org/OME ) The metadata model will include fields that are required, recommended , and optional. Using this data repository, the data sets will be findable and reusable. All descriptors will be given in a language that can be understood across multiple disciplines to reach the broader scientific community. Data will be deposited in a standard format t hat is commonly accepted and able which can be accessible to everyone. We will use shared vocabularies and ontologies to promote data interoperability. In the case of usage of uncommon or generated project -specific ontologies or vocabularies, clear descri ptions and easily accessible mappings to more commonly used ontologies will be provided. The generated ontologies or vocabularies will be openly published to allow reusing, refining or extending them. The references will also be included wherever applicab le in a standardized and acceptable manner. Text documents and Excel files stored within each experiment folder in the J -Drive or L -Drive will respectively contain guidelines describing data collection/analysis methods and all relevant metadata FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 15 (including experimental conditions, sample keys, computational analysis pipelines and their parameters) to ensure the reusability of the data and the reproducibility of any further data generation.

Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Upon data collection/pre -processing, data will be stored in the J -Drive or L-Drive of our research unit. These servers are centrally managed by ICTS KU Leuven and ha ve back -up capacities (KU Leuven enterprise box, Large volume -storage) . Temporary copies of the data will be made and kept on personal hard drives if necessary . Metadata will be made openly available and licensed under a public domain dedication open licenses (Creative Commons Attribution International Public License (CC BY)). Both EGA and RDR ensures long term storage. KU Leuven RDR ensures storage for at least 10 years. However, it is possible to request that the data be kept for a longer period of time (such as 20 -25 years for medical fields). FAIR principle A2 states that metadata should persist even when the data are no longer sustained. In addition, data will be available in easily accessible form, e.g., pdf, excel files. Relevant software and coding details will made available via the use of repository such as GitLa b and GitHub, which will also ensure reuse and version control. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS , STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON -DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH .7 REFER TO INSTITUTION -SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE . Data stored on the KU Leuven J -Drive and L -Drive is managed, maintained, and backed up by KU Leuven IT Services (ICTS ). Specifically, mirror copies of the stored data are made immediately upon upload for safety backup purposes. Both EGA and RDR ensures long term storage. KU Leuven RDR ensures storage for at least 10 years. However, it is possible to re quest that the data be kept for a longer period of time . Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: Yes, the KU Leuven J -Drive and L -Drive has sufficient storage capacity for the outlined project. If no, please specify : How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The EGA provides a web -based portal and an API to enable data controllers to manage data access and transfer permissions. Authorization infrastructure (AAI) management is vital for operating the EGA, where a user's identity is verified before confirming ac cess rights to particular information. When a researcher logs FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 17 CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 7 into the EGA website to access sensitive metadata, their credentials are authenticated. They can then browse a dataset of interest and request the download of sensitive data. If the researcher i s permitted to access the dataset after the EGA validates their request, the request is approved, and they can retrieve the data. Regarding the data of patients or human tissue samples, the patient's name or other identifying information will be stored sep arately (site file) from their study data and replaced with a unique code to keep the patient's identity secret. The subject identification log, linking the identifiers to the participant’s name, will be kept in the site’s regulatory binder and only access ible by the treating physician. Clinical reports necessary for remote source data verification will be de -identified, coded with the personal identifiers and electronically transmitted to the partners. No personally identifiable information will be at any time shared. For personal data deposited in EGA and RDR that are not publicly accessible, access can be requested via the designated data access committee. Data stored on KU Leuven -managed personal computers are protected via password access to the computers, as set up by the KU Leuven IT Department. Off -site access to J -Drive and L -Drive data is available from KU Leuven personal computers and data access points and is password protected. Upon request, access to the shared drive will be given only to authorized researchers. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The annual cost of J -Drive storage is €519 and L -Drive is €1 13.84 per 1TB of storage space per year. This cost a nd capacity include the performance of mirror copies of the stored data, for safety backup purposes. We expect that 5 TB will be sufficient to store all data generated as part of the project. These costs will be covered by the budget of the project lead (Prof. Gianluca Matteoli). 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the All raw data will be retained for at least 5 years on the K -Drive storage space. Publication data will be further organized and catalogued on a figure -by-figure basis for future reference to raw datasets used for figure generation . FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 18 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE , CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY .

For storage and sharing, we will ensure compliance with GDPR, and will use trusted European repositories such as RDR (https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr) or EGA ( https://ega -archive.org/ ). Metadata will be made openly available and licensed under a public domain dedication open licenses (Creative Commons Attribution International Public License (CC BY)). The access for data from human tissue will be restricted. end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contract ual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). As stated in the ICF, all data are anonymized. These will be also preserved for the 5 -year period after end of this project. The generated data will be stored on designated KUL servers. Only in case of findings which have direct implications for the health or disease status of the patient, the princip al investigator has the code to go back to the original patient, as also stipulated in the ICF. This code is stored on the hospital UZ server which is password prot ected and which also allows to consult the electronic medical chart of the patient stored on UZ Leuven Hospital servers. Also, Both EGA and RDR ensures long term storage. KU Leuven RDR ensures storage for at least 10 years. However, it is possible to reque st that the data be kept for a longer period of time . Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? Long term data archives will be maintained in specific archive folders on the K -Drive. With the server centrally managed by the ICTS , we will use the back -up possibilities as proposed by KU Leuven ICTS . What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The annual cost of K -Drive storage is €5.69 per 100GB of storage space per year. We expect that 5 TB will be sufficient for long -term storage of all data generated as part of the project. These costs will be covered by the budget of the project lead (Prof. Gianluca Matteoli ). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 19 If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Data not deposited in open -access repositories will in principle only be accessible to members of Prof. Matteoli ’s lab. Other collaborations and sharing are possible with staff within the Inflammatory Bowel Disease research group at TARGID, upon reasonable request. Any user can place reasonable requests data for non -commercial purposes, and these requests will be asse ssed on a case -by-case basis by the project lead (Prof. Gianluca Matteoli). Commercial -based requests will be discussed with the project lead as well. Furthermore, the EGA offers a web -based portal and an API to allow data controllers to manage data acces s and transfer permissions. Authorization infrastructure (AAI) management is a key for operating the EGA where the identity of a user is verified before confirming the access rights to specific information. When a researcher signs in to the EGA website to access sensitive metadata, their credentials are authenticated to verify their identity. Then they can navigate to a dataset of interest and request download of the sensitive data. After the EGA validate their request against the permissions assigned to th eir identity, if the researcher has permission to access the dataset, the request is authorised, and they can download the data . Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☒ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No All personally identifiab le information is replaced by a unique study identifier for each patient and each biological sample. The subject identification log, linking the identifiers to the participant’s name, will be only kept in the site’s regulatory binder and only accessible by the treating physician s (Prof. Séverine Vermeire , Dr. Bram Verstockt, UZ Leuven). This log will allow proper monitoring of the clinical records and by the appointed monitors to assure completeness, accuracy and correctness of the data collected at the sit e. Clinical reports necessary for remote source data verification will be de -identified, coded with the personal identifiers and electronically transmitted to the partners. No personally identifiable information will be at any time shared. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 20 Where will the data be made available?
