To illustrate, a Belgian \nDutch (hence ‘BD’) speaker might prefer to address their doctor with the pronominal variant ‘u’   rather \nthan the variants ‘je’ or ‘ge’ be cause they consider it the most appropriate in the formal context of a \ndoctor’s visit. Such BD pronouns of address (including ‘u’, ‘je’, and ‘ge’) are employed as a case study in \nthis project, since they show socially meaningful language variation on two d imensions: On the first \ndimension, they range from more to less formal, and on the second dimension, they range from standard \nto colloquial (Plevoets et al., 2008). To obtain the best view into how the development of socially \nFWO DMP (Flemish Standard DMP)  Nina Arisci (nina.arisci@kuleuv en.be)   2 meaningful language variation is related to social functioning (e.g., socially engaging with others) and \nlanguage processing (e.g., using certain grammatical structures while talking), the participants of this \nproject are (pre)adolescents with DS . These individuals’ have a unique developmental profile: They have \nstrengths in social functioning on the one hand (Næss et al., 2017), and challenges with language \nprocessing on the other (Abbeduto et al., 2020). Overall, this project aims to recruit 32 dyads, each \nconsisting of a (pre)ad olescent with DS and their caregiver. It will investigate (a) how (pre)adolescents with \nDS vary in their productions of Belgian Dutch pronouns of address (via spontaneous language samples and \na “discourse completion” experiment where they complete utteranc es), (b) how they vary in their \nevaluations of Belgian Dutch pronouns of address (via a “speaker evaluation” experiment where they \nexpress their attitude towards ‘u’/’je’/ ‘gij’ use in specific contexts and utterances), (c) the role of the \ncaregiver in the ir productions and evaluations, and (d) how the participants reflect upon the results \nspecific to their dyad, via a semi -structured interview. In line with the United Nation’s slogan “Nothing \nabout us without us”, the project employs a participatory resear ch framework by including a focus group \nof (pre)adolescents with DS and their caregiver, a consultation board of persons professionally or privately \ninvolved with individuals with DS outside academia, and by involving the participants in the co -analysis of  \ntheir results. The results are correlated with several measures of language processing and social \nfunctioning in the (pre)adolescents with DS to map out the development of socially meaningful language \nvariation. This project contributes to our understandi ng of the social meaning in language and advances \ncurrent knowledge in developmental sociolinguistics by adding a unique perspective to the discipline.  \n \nLiterature  \nAbbeduto, L., Arias -Trejo, N., Thurman, A.

Documentation and Metadata  \n \nClearly describe what approach will be followed \nto capture the accompanying information \nnecessary to keep data understandable and \nusable , for yourself and others, now and in the \nfuture (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and \ntypes required, procedures used, Electronic Lab \nNotebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. \nwhere this information is recorded).  \n Documentation and metadata will  be systematically developed and indicated throughout the project. At \nproject end,  all metadata and related documentation will be re -evaluated in terms of understandability \nand usability. The specific measures taken include:  \n• Organization and storage of sources relevant for literature management (articles, tags, annotations ) on \nZotero. A readme -file describing the principles of organization (e.g., folder name system or color \nannotations) will be added to the main library.  \n• Organization of a ll further projec t documents  in a folder system. The file and folder names will be \nschematically consistent and semantically meaningful. Folders will contain readme -files wherever \ndeemed helpful for a full understanding of their contents, and individual files will contain links to other \nfiles if appropriate (via indication of file names). Versioning will be implemented with all the files \ncreated throughout the project and older versions will be archived.  \nWill a metadata standard be used to make it \neasier to find and reuse the data ?  \n \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard \nwill be used. If not, please specify which \nmetadata will be created to make the data \neasier to find and reuse.  ☒ Yes \nSpecification:  The CHAT transcription conventions  will be relied on  for transcription of audio and video \nfiles. These are well -established in linguistics and allow transcribing multimodal communication (e.g., \ngestures). Further conventions are TBD.  \n☐ No \n \n \n \n4. Data Storage & Back -up during the Research Project  \n \nWhere will the data be stored?  Pseudonymized data will be stored on SharePoint Online. Non -pseudonymized data (i.e., the audio \nrecordings, the video recordings, the contact list containing personal and identification data) will be stored \non an external hard disk.  \nFWO DMP (Flemish Standard DMP)  Nina Arisci (nina.arisci@kuleuv en.be)   11 How will the data be backed up?  SharePoint Online provides an automatic backup system, which performs backups every few hours of the \nday where the 7 versions are saved, as well as every day where the last 6 versions are sa ved, and every \nweek where the last 2 versions are saved.  The external hard disk will be backed up with a second external \nhard disk. These backups will be performed manually whenever changes are made on the principal \nexternal hard disk. Backup events will b e documented. Physical data other than literature sources \navailable at the library for which no digital pendant exists will be imme diately digitized and stored on one \nof the two platforms described above (as appropriate in the individual case) . \nIs there c urrently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.  ☒ Yes \nSpecification:  SharePoint Online offers 20 GB net storage, which pseudonymized data is not expected \nto surpass throughout the project. External hard disks will be  acquired in line with the expected storage \nspace required (currently estimated to be < 1 TB in total).  \n☐ No \nHow will you en sure that the data are securely \nstored and not accessed or modified by \nunauthorized persons?  In consultation with two KU Leuven ICT experts, a ll data will be encrypted via the tool AES Crypt before \nbeing stored. SharePoint Online is secured via Multi -Facto r Authentication. The external hard disk will be \nstored at the PhD student’s office space at KU Leuven Brussels campus, where it will be locked with a key \nthat is only available to the PhD student. Outside office hours, the building is only accessible for KU Leuven \nmembers. The office itself is only accessible for KU Leuven staff who have a fixed desk in that office.  \nAll data will be processed on company -owned laptops protected by Bitlocker Drive Encryption, which \nintegrates with the operating system and p rotects the data from theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or \ninappropriately decommissioned computers. Finally, a s tools and regulations for protecting sensitive data \nevolve rapidly, IT and privacy experts at KU Leuven will be consulted regularly  to re -evaluate the most \ncurrent security measures to be taken and to ensure that the latest laws and regulations are followed. A \nPRET application to describe the processing of the participants’ personal data  has also been submitted  and \nnecessary updates or improvements included in the feedback will be taken into consideration.  \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?  Free storage of pseudonymized data on S harePoint Online, storage of non -pseudonymized data on \nexternal hard drive (likely between 100 and 300 euros per exemplar). These costs will be covered through \nthe FWO bench fee.  \n \n \n \nFWO DMP (Flemish Standard DMP)  Nina Arisci (nina.arisci@kuleuv en.be)   12 5. Data Preservation  after the end of the Research P roject  \n \nWhich data will be retained for at least five \nyears (or longer, in agreement with other \nretention policies that are applicable) after the \nend of the project? In case some data cannot be \npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this  \n(e.g. legal or contract ual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, institutional policies...).  The pseudonymized data will be retained for 10 years after the end of the project. The non -\npseudonymized data will be deleted at project end, given that  it is highly sensitive data.  \nWher e will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long -term)?  On SharePoint Online.  \nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during the expected retention \nperiod? How will these costs be covered?  No costs are expected.  \n \n \n6. Data Sharing and Reuse  \n \nWill the data (or part of the data) be made \navailable for reuse after/during the project?   \nPlease explain per dataset or data type which \ndata will be made available.  ☐ Yes, in an Open Access repository  \n☐ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …)  \n☐ No (closed access)  \n☒ Other  \nSpecification:  Pseudonymized data will be made available under restricted access, non -pseudonymize d \ndata will be presented in terms of metadata under closed access. Excerpts of the data can be made \navailable to other reviewers on request, and after signing a confidentiality agreement.  \nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be \nable to access the data and under what \nconditions.  Access to pseudonymized data will be given to other reviewers on request, and after signing a \nconfidentiality agreement.  \nFWO DMP (Flemish Standard DMP)  Nina Arisci (nina.arisci@kuleuv en.be)   13 Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the \nsharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in \nan agreement with a 3rd party, legal \nrestrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data \ntype where appropriate.  ☒ Yes, privacy aspects  \n☒ Yes, intellectual property rights  \n☒ Yes, ethical aspects  \n☐ Yes, aspects of dual use  \n☐ Yes, other  \n☐ No \n \nSpecification:  All datasets containing personal data (see asterisks in Table above) are particularly sensitive  \nin terms of privacy and related ethical considerations  (e.g., given that minors are able to give informed \nassent but not informed consent ). They are thus only shared after pseudonymization.  Literature sources \nare subject to intellectual property rights and are accordingly referred to wherever appropriate.  \nWhere will the data be made available?  \nIf already known, please provide a repository \nper dataset or data type.  Data will be made available on the data repository of the Meertens Institute (see \nhttps://www.re3data.org/repository/r3d100011334 ). \nWhen will the data be made available?

To illustrate, a Belgian Dutch (hence ‘BD’) speaker might prefer to address their doctor with the pronominal variant ‘u’ rather than the variants ‘je’ or ‘ge’ be cause they consider it the most appropriate in the formal context of a doctor’s visit. Such BD pronouns of address (including ‘u’, ‘je’, and ‘ge’) are employed as a case study in this project, since they show socially meaningful language variation on two d imensions: On the first dimension, they range from more to less formal, and on the second dimension, they range from standard to colloquial (Plevoets et al., 2008). To obtain the best view into how the development of socially FWO DMP (Flemish Standard DMP) Nina Arisci (nina.arisci@kuleuv en.be) 2 meaningful language variation is related to social functioning (e.g., socially engaging with others) and language processing (e.g., using certain grammatical structures while talking), the participants of this project are (pre)adolescents with DS . These individuals’ have a unique developmental profile: They have strengths in social functioning on the one hand (Næss et al., 2017), and challenges with language processing on the other (Abbeduto et al., 2020). Overall, this project aims to recruit 32 dyads, each consisting of a (pre)ad olescent with DS and their caregiver. It will investigate (a) how (pre)adolescents with DS vary in their productions of Belgian Dutch pronouns of address (via spontaneous language samples and a “discourse completion” experiment where they complete utteranc es), (b) how they vary in their evaluations of Belgian Dutch pronouns of address (via a “speaker evaluation” experiment where they express their attitude towards ‘u’/’je’/ ‘gij’ use in specific contexts and utterances), (c) the role of the caregiver in the ir productions and evaluations, and (d) how the participants reflect upon the results specific to their dyad, via a semi -structured interview. In line with the United Nation’s slogan “Nothing about us without us”, the project employs a participatory resear ch framework by including a focus group of (pre)adolescents with DS and their caregiver, a consultation board of persons professionally or privately involved with individuals with DS outside academia, and by involving the participants in the co -analysis of their results. The results are correlated with several measures of language processing and social functioning in the (pre)adolescents with DS to map out the development of socially meaningful language variation. This project contributes to our understandi ng of the social meaning in language and advances current knowledge in developmental sociolinguistics by adding a unique perspective to the discipline.

If so, please d escribe these issues further and refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. ☒ Yes, human subject data ☐ Yes, animal data ☐ Yes, dual use ☐ No If yes, please describe: The project involves collection of personal data from the participants through several non -invasive methods (datasets which contain personal data are indicated in the table above with an asterisk) . The personal data collected from participating minors (with Down Syndrome) is particularly sensitive , as they are not legally able to give informed consent (though t hey will be asked to give informed assent). FWO DMP (Flemish Standard DMP) Nina Arisci (nina.arisci@kuleuv en.be) 9 Will you process personal data ? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate . If available, add the reference to your file in your host institution's privacy register. ☒ Yes Short description of the kind of personal data that will be used: Datasets which contain personal data are indicated in the table above with an asterisk. Privacy Registry Reference: G-2022 -5917 (KU Leuven PRET -number) , S67580 (Ethics Committee Research UZ / KU Leuven S-number) ☐ No Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin - offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes , please comment : NA Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. ☒ Yes Explanation : Literature sources and Diagnostic Assessments are subject to copyright and shall be reused only with appropriate reference to the original source. Results from Diagnostic Assessments may have been previously collected by (pre)adolescents with DS’ speech -language -therapist within the scope of diagnostics and therapy. These materials shall only be reused upon caregivers’ consent obtained in the Informed Consent Form. ☐ No Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. ☐ Yes ☒ No FWO DMP (Flemish Standard DMP) Nina Arisci (nina.arisci@kuleuv en.be) 10 3. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). Documentation and metadata will be systematically developed and indicated throughout the project. At project end, all metadata and related documentation will be re -evaluated in terms of understandability and usability. The specific measures taken include: • Organization and storage of sources relevant for literature management (articles, tags, annotations ) on Zotero. A readme -file describing the principles of organization (e.g., folder name system or color annotations) will be added to the main library. • Organization of a ll further projec t documents in a folder system. The file and folder names will be schematically consistent and semantically meaningful. Folders will contain readme -files wherever deemed helpful for a full understanding of their contents, and individual files will contain links to other files if appropriate (via indication of file names). Versioning will be implemented with all the files created throughout the project and older versions will be archived. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. ☒ Yes Specification: The CHAT transcription conventions will be relied on for transcription of audio and video files. These are well -established in linguistics and allow transcribing multimodal communication (e.g., gestures). Further conventions are TBD. ☐ No 4. Data Storage & Back -up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Pseudonymized data will be stored on SharePoint Online. Non -pseudonymized data (i.e., the audio recordings, the video recordings, the contact list containing personal and identification data) will be stored on an external hard disk. FWO DMP (Flemish Standard DMP) Nina Arisci (nina.arisci@kuleuv en.be) 11 How will the data be backed up? SharePoint Online provides an automatic backup system, which performs backups every few hours of the day where the 7 versions are saved, as well as every day where the last 6 versions are sa ved, and every week where the last 2 versions are saved. The external hard disk will be backed up with a second external hard disk. These backups will be performed manually whenever changes are made on the principal external hard disk. Backup events will b e documented. Physical data other than literature sources available at the library for which no digital pendant exists will be imme diately digitized and stored on one of the two platforms described above (as appropriate in the individual case) . Is there c urrently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes Specification: SharePoint Online offers 20 GB net storage, which pseudonymized data is not expected to surpass throughout the project. External hard disks will be acquired in line with the expected storage space required (currently estimated to be < 1 TB in total). ☐ No How will you en sure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? In consultation with two KU Leuven ICT experts, a ll data will be encrypted via the tool AES Crypt before being stored. SharePoint Online is secured via Multi -Facto r Authentication. The external hard disk will be stored at the PhD student’s office space at KU Leuven Brussels campus, where it will be locked with a key that is only available to the PhD student. Outside office hours, the building is only accessible for KU Leuven members. The office itself is only accessible for KU Leuven staff who have a fixed desk in that office. All data will be processed on company -owned laptops protected by Bitlocker Drive Encryption, which integrates with the operating system and p rotects the data from theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers. Finally, a s tools and regulations for protecting sensitive data evolve rapidly, IT and privacy experts at KU Leuven will be consulted regularly to re -evaluate the most current security measures to be taken and to ensure that the latest laws and regulations are followed. A PRET application to describe the processing of the participants’ personal data has also been submitted and necessary updates or improvements included in the feedback will be taken into consideration. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Free storage of pseudonymized data on S harePoint Online, storage of non -pseudonymized data on external hard drive (likely between 100 and 300 euros per exemplar). These costs will be covered through the FWO bench fee. FWO DMP (Flemish Standard DMP) Nina Arisci (nina.arisci@kuleuv en.be) 12 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contract ual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). The pseudonymized data will be retained for 10 years after the end of the project. The non - pseudonymized data will be deleted at project end, given that it is highly sensitive data. Wher e will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? On SharePoint Online. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? No costs are expected. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. ☐ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☐ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☒ Other Specification: Pseudonymized data will be made available under restricted access, non -pseudonymize d data will be presented in terms of metadata under closed access. Excerpts of the data can be made available to other reviewers on request, and after signing a confidentiality agreement. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Access to pseudonymized data will be given to other reviewers on request, and after signing a confidentiality agreement. FWO DMP (Flemish Standard DMP) Nina Arisci (nina.arisci@kuleuv en.be) 13 Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☒ Yes, privacy aspects ☒ Yes, intellectual property rights ☒ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No Specification: All datasets containing personal data (see asterisks in Table above) are particularly sensitive in terms of privacy and related ethical considerations (e.g., given that minors are able to give informed assent but not informed consent ). They are thus only shared after pseudonymization. Literature sources are subject to intellectual property rights and are accordingly referred to wherever appropriate. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. Data will be made available on the data repository of the Meertens Institute (see https://www.re3data.org/repository/r3d100011334 ). When will the data be made available? Upon publication of research results. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. Data that can be shared will be made available under a Creative Commons Attribution license (CC -BY 4.0), so that users have to give credit to the original data creators. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. ☒ Yes ☐ No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? No costs are expected. FWO DMP (Flemish Standard DMP) Nina Arisci (nina.arisci@kuleuv en.be) 14 7.
