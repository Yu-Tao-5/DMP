Such\ninsight would be particularly useful for optimizing decision-making strategies when different latent parameters, such as response bias or impulsivity,\nlead to incorrect choices. In this project, we aim to\naddress this question by investigating whether humans can accurately monitor and regulate the cognitive parameters that influence their decision-\nmaking, and whether this ability leads to more adaptive decision-making behavior. We will also explore the neural mechanisms that support\nmetacognitive insight into latent cognitive parameters. Our findings may shed light on the\nfundamental processes underlying decision-making and inform the development of interventions aimed at improving metacognitive abilities.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n16-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). institutional policies...). All pseudonymized data (i.e. choices, RTs and confidence reports for WP1-3; EEG and pupil recordings for WP3) will be stored and made accessible via an Open Access repository (e.g., Open Science Framework) after the publication of the results. The data will be preserved for ten years, after which they will be destroyed. Note that a copy of the data will remain available through an Open Access repository. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? 1. The data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. 2. In addition, data will be posted post-publication on an Open Access repository (e.g. Open Science Framework). What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period?
