They are an evolutionary answer to living on a rotating planet with 24-hour cycles, tailoring metabolic processes to the environmental\nsetting. The plant circadian clock consists of an oscillating regulatory loop with transcription factors that can influence around a third of all expressed\ngenes in plants. Adaptation of plants to higher latitudes will be a means to escape rising temperatures caused by anthropogenic climate change but will\nmake adaptation to the differing latitudinal light conditions necessary. Using Arabidopsis thaliana as a plant model organism and focusing on the\nmorning-expressed transcription factors of the circadian clock, LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTOYL (LHY) and CIRCADIAN CLOCK-\nASSOCIATED1 (CCA1), I will generate, and study mutants of these genes showing altered latitudinal response and these plants will be tested under\nnovel in-lab Simulated Latitudinal Light Environments (SLLEs). With this, I want to broaden our understanding on how the plant circadian clock\nregulates the growth and development of plants at different latitudes, adding twilight length as a variable that has not been considered in the current\nmodels of daylength sensing in plants. With my work, I will shine a light on how the circadian clock can drive latitudinal adaptation as an adaptive\nresponse to climate change in plants.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n23-02-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
