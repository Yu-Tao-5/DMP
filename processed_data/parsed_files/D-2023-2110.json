In\nthis context, KU Leuven and partners developed a prototype of a new, innovative, multisensory pain & anxiety toolkit\nfor children. This prototype was tested on more than 150 children undergoing needle-related medical procedures, with\nexcellent results. In this project, we aim to rework and extend the current little NIRVANA 1.0 solution into a modular,\nmulti-application little NIRVANA 2.0 solution for pediatric dentistry. To this end, we will build on the needle application\nsoftware and extend it for dentistry by modifying and extending its content and design. A field study of the system in a\nreal environment will be part of the validation in the second year of the project. In this field study, we will test the new\nprototype on pediatric patients undergoing dental procedures at UZ Leuven.\nLast modified: \n31-05-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

LRD is actively\ninvolved in the preparations. All data types and datasets will contribute to this initiative; the software is IP from KU Leuven, the results of the field research are important\nfor the validation of the software and services of this new entity.\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material or Data transfer agreements, Research\ncollaboration agreements)? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.\nNo\nAre there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please\nexplain in the comment section to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.\nYes\nYes, the software that will be created in this project will build on the previous software for needle-related procedures. The latter is jointly owned by RISE (Research\nInstitutes Sweden) and KU Leuven. LRD is currently in negotiations to transfer the rights of this initial software from RISE to KU Leuven.\nDocumentation and Metadata\nClearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep \ndata understandable and usable\n, for\nyourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks,\nREADME.txt files, codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). \nsoftware: \nall code is extensively documented. This is part of the ongoing software transfer agreement currently being discussed by RISE and KU Leuven.\nREADME files: data will be described according to category (questionnaires) and structured according to several identifiers: title, year, location, author/creator, file type,\nkey words, ...\nResults of the prototype study (questionnaires and rating instruments):\n all recorded data are stored in a DB, including the questionnaires and rating instruments\nthemselves. Thus, the answers to the questionnaires and the results of the rating instruments are self-explanatory and understandable to all.\nThrough a clear folder structure located on the One Drive, existing data and developed material will be organised in order to simplify retrieving and consulting the overall\ndocumentation. Produced material will adopt meaningful filenaming starting with the date (year/month/day, e.g. 230331_), description of its content and, when applicable,\nending with the initials of the creator.\nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to \nfind and reuse the data\n?  \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. \nIf not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. \nNo\nThe data and data structure is very simple and it is easy to find and reuse data. Therefore, no metadata standard is required. \nData Storage & Back-up during the Research Project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nOneDrive (KU Leuven)\nOther (specify below)\nQuestionnaires will be completed on a research tablet (via a research app) and - after completion - sent to OneDrive. Note: data cannot be collected directly on a server\nbecause network functionality cannot be guaranteed in all medical cabinets.\nUser logs are automatically stored on a KU Leuven research PC (or tablet) running the little NIRVANA software. Usage logs are automatically sent to OneDrive when a\nnetwork connection is established.\nBack-ups of Software is stored on KU Leuven's OneDrive. Software will be deployed on KU Leuven tablets and PC's.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nStandard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution\nOther (specify below)\nIn addition to the standard back-up procedures, the standard back-up system of the Medical Image Research Center (MIRC) will also be used. This is managed by the IT\nmanager of the MIRC. \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? \nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, explain how this will be taken care of. \nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 31 May 2023\n3 of 5\nYes\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? \nKU Leuven's standard procedures (IT and MIRC) are followed to store and secure the data. Since no personal data is collected, the level of confidentiality is low (privacy is\nhigh).\nNormally no physical data are collected, but in case of failure of the research app, tablet or PC, we will print a copy of the questionnaires (as a backup). These printed\nquestionnaires will be stored in locked cabinets in the MIRC. The MIRC itself has a restricted access policy.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nThe data volume is extremely small (especially compared to the volumes which the MIRC is used to handling). Therefore, no additional hardware or software needs to be\npurchased to store the data. The data will be placed on the current MIRC servers. A (very small) fee is paid to IT for this purpose. The MIRC will bear the cost of this fee\nthrough their operating budget.\nData Preservation after the end of the Research Project\nWhich data will be retained for 10 years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? \nIn case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional\npolicies...).\nAll data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? \nOther (specify below)\nData will be stored for long-term use on research servers of the MIRC (managed by the IT manager of the MIRC).\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nThe expected costs are extremely low considering the limited volume. It is estimated that this cost is  < 100 Euros. Costs will be covered through the operating budget of\nthe MIRC. \nData Sharing and Reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  \nPlease explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available.\nYes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only)\nData might be made available to other researchers for research purposes under strict conditions and under the FAIR principle\nData and data rights can also be transferred to the new spin-off entity in collaboration with LRD. \nData of prototype study will be made available by congress abstract, paper publication and further dissemination by seminars, workshops.\nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. \nAccess to data is restricted to all researchers, promoters and co-promoters of the C3 project. If access to data is requested and deemed valuable/necessary by the current\nresearch team, advice will be sought from LRD for drafting legal agreements to control access and rights.\nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? \nPlease explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nYes, intellectual property rights\nThe software is IP from KU Leuven.\nWhere will the data be made available?  \nCreated using DMPonline.be.
