The most recent therapies aim to\nreactivate the patient's immune system to recognize and fight the cancer cells. Such therapies have been proven extremely effective\nleading to strong remission, but a significant proportion of patients show resistance to such approaches and cannot profit from such an\nadvanced medical care. In this proposal we aim to understand why subsets of patients do not respond to immunotherapies: a knowledge\nthat is of central importance to identify new therapeutic strategies to be used to synergize and improve the current treatments. In\nparticular our team found that macrophages, a particular white blood cell that was first known to \"eat\" bacteria, change their phenotype\nwhen immunotherapies are administered to non responding patients. Our preliminary results suggest that in non-responders to cancer\nimmunotherapy the macrophages become particularly avid for nutrients increasing their consumption. This leads to a tumoural\nmicroenvironment that is scarce for nutrients: an environment that does not allow T lymphocytes (the killers of our immune system) to be\nactivated by the immunotherapy and fight the cancer cells. With this proposal we want to better characterize the metabolic interplay\namong the different cells present in the cancer tissue and understand how to modify it to increase the efficacy of antitumor treatment.\nLast modified: \n15-12-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Relevant raw data will be made publicly available through upload to well-established open-access data Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 15 December 2023 7 of 9 repositories. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Data may be shared externally upon reasonable requests from collaborating scientists, which will be reviewed and approved on a case-by-case basis by the project leaders. We do not exclude that the proposed work could result in research data with the potential for tech transfer and valorization. The partner institutes have a policy to actively monitor research data for such potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of cases, the invention will be IP-protected (mostly patent protection or copyright protection). As such the IP protection does not withhold the research data from being made public. In the case a decision is taken to file a patent application it will be planned so that any delay to publication is minimal. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes, Other We do not exclude that the proposed work could result in research data with the potential for tech transfer and valorization. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of cases, the invention will be IP-protected (mostly patent protection or copyright protection). As such the IP protection does not withhold the research data from being made public. In the case a decision is taken to file a patent application it will be planned so that any delay to publication is minimal. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. Depending on the nature of the dataset both open-access and restricted-access repositories will be used to store data. All requests and approvals for the reuse of data other than those deposited in open-access repositories will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the project leader. When will the data be made available? As study leader, Prof. Massimiliano Mazzone will monitor data-sharing requests. Data will be automatically made available after the publication of results to any requestor using the data for non-commercial purposes. The VIB tech transfer office will negotiate commercial use of the data. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. Data not deposited in open-access repositories will in principle only be accessible to members of the lab. Other collaborations and sharing are possible with staff and students within the VIB–KU Leuven Center for Cancer Biology and within the KU Leuven Department of Oncology, upon reasonable request. Any user can place reasonable requests for data for non-commercial purposes, and these requests will be assessed on a case- by-case basis by the project leader. Commercial-based requests will be navigated in coordination between the KU Leuven/VIB Tech Transfer team. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. Yes When relevant PID/DOI/accession numbers will be added to datasets What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Mainly publication fees. Covered with the FWO budget. Other costs for data sharing will be discussed with collaborators on a case-by-case basis. 6. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project? Data documentation, and metadata acquisition and storage will be performed by the students and postdocs associated with this project. Prof. Massimiliano Mazzone, Marcello Delfini (Staff Scientist) and Sarah Trusso Cafarello (Lab Manager) will monitor. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 15 December 2023 8 of 9 Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project? Data documentation, and metadata acquisition and storage will be performed by the students and postdocs associated with this project. Prof. Massimiliano Mazzone, Marcello Delfini (Staff Scientist) and Sarah Trusso Cafarello (Lab Manager) will monitor. Who will manage data preservation and sharing? As study leader, Prof. Massimiliano Mazzone will be responsible for data preservation. He will also monitor data sharing requests. Data will be automatically made available after the publication of results to any requestor using the data for non-commercial purposes. Commercial use of the data will be negotiated through the VIB tech transfer office. Who will update and implement this DMP? The lab manager (Sarah Trusso Cafarello, lab of Tumor Inflammation and Angiogenesis), staff scientist (Dr. Marcello Delfini, lab of Tumor Inflammation and Angiogenesis) and the PI (Prof. Massimiliano Mazzone) will share the responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP.
