Drug discovery of epigenetic drugs.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. General Information\nName of the project lead (PI)\nZeger Debyser\nC1-C2 Project number & title\nC14/21/099\nThe epigenetic reader LEDGF/p75 in health and disease.\n2. Data description\n2.1. Will you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\n2.2. What data will you collect, generate or reuse? Describe the origin, type and\nformat of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a\nnumbered list or table and per objective of the project.\n1. Analogous data generated : cell lines are stored in cell bank with appropriate registration,\nproteins expressed and purified are stored in protein database of the lab; plasmids will be\nengineered and stored in a plasmid database; primers and antibodies will be commercially\nacquired and stored in respective databases. \n2. Throughout WPs analytical data (PCR data, electrophoresis data, western blot data,\nimmunohistochemistry data, microscopy data) will be initially be collected in a variety of file\nformats mainly Microsoft Excel, MS Word and equipment specific software such as FlowJo for flow\ncytometry data. These files will also be stored in Open Document Format or as CSV files.\nEstimated size 200-300GB.\n3. Digital images will be saved as TIFF files with an estimated volume of 200 GB;\n \n3. Ethical and legal issues\n3.1. Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you\nwill use. Add the reference to the file in KU Leuven's Record of Processing Activities.\nBe aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNo\n3.2. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s).\nOnly related to the use of human cell lines and human PBL from Blood Transfusion.\nA S number is requested for.\n3.3. Does your research possibly result in research data with potential for tech\ntransfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If\nso, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted?\nHit compounds will be discovered in the project; their chemical nature will remain confidential\nbut only after chemical optimisation the compounds will be protected by IP after consulting with\nthe Tech Transfer office (Ku Leuven LR&D).\n3.4. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the\ndata you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions regarding\nreuse and sharing are in place?\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 4\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\n4.1. What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of the\ndata collected/generated in this project?\nAll collected digital data (i.e. cell line information, proteomic information, protocols, etc) are and\nwill be stored in an online labmanagement system with integrated Electronic Lab Notebook\nOneNote which runs on a secured and backed up server of KULeuven (managed by ICT of the\nBiomedical Sciences Group). This system also provides a logging system so no data can ever be\nerased, making that everything will be tracable and stored longterm (well beyond the common 5\nyear requirement). Certificates of cell lines and antibodies are stored as well with a link to te\nexperiment. All researchers also keep a paper labbook with annotations of\ndates/experiments/protocols/results/ and references to OneNote labbook and other files/folders\n(imaging data). Labbooks are archived in personal folders in a secured archive room. For all\ncoworkers it is mandatory to use a tracking system between labbook, electronic note book and\ndigital files. During the project we attempt to select a unified tracking system.\n4.2. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be\nused. If not, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nYes\nCoworkers already store important info together with experimental data in electronic labbook.\nWe are in the process of adapting this info to metastandards in our Data Repository.\nWe will use standards listed on https://fairsharing.org/ with already available standards for\nFlow cytometry :\nhttps://www.re3data.org/search?query=statistics&metadataStandards%5B%5D=other\nMicroscopy imaging :\nhttps://www.openmicroscopy.org/\nqRT-PCR:\nhttp://miqe.gene-quantification.info/\nIn house metastandards for western blotting, cellular experiments will be generated during the\nproject..\n5. Data storage and backup during the C1-C2 project\n5.1. Where will the data be stored?\nThe time-stamped master copy of the data will be kept on our research unit central storage\nfacility. Copies can be made and kept on personal devices. Source data for publications are\ncollected in separate digital or paper folders at the moment of submission and handed over to\nthe PI. These folders are archived in the archive (paper folders) or on the central storoge facility\nof KU Leuven.\n5.2. How will the data be backed up?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic daily back-up\nprocedures.\n5.3. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes We have a shared drive (restricted acces) on the university's central servers\n(GBW0408_Molecular_Medicine_Backup, size 700gb) and archive drive\n(GBW0025_Molecular_Medicine_Storage, size 5TB) for during the project\n5.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nThe expected amount of data is 500 gb, the cost for during the project is then estimated on 250\neuro per year.\n5.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not\naccessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nAll data are stored on university central servers, paper folders (labbooks, paper source data) are\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 4\nkept in a locked archive room with restricted acces (PI and secretary).\n6. Data preservation after the end of the C1-C2 project\n6.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the\nproject? If only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is\nthe case (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll data are kept for 5 years on the electronic labbook (and/or paper labbook). Data of technically\nflawed experiments are not kept. Analagous data (plasmids, cell lines) are kept for 5 years.\nProteins, vectors are available until exhaustion. Mouse strains are kept in principle. Source data\nfor publications are kept in a separate folder in the archive room for 10 years after publication.\n6.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)?\nDigital data are archived on the central server facility of the KU Leuven.\nPublication folders (physical) are stored in the archive room with restricted access.\nCell lines are kept frozen in liquid Nitrogen (cell biobank).\nProteins are kept at -20C or -80C in protein database as long as available..\nPlasmids and antibidies are kept at -20°C in databases. \n \n6.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How\nwill the costs be covered?\nArchiving in the archive room comes with no cost. The database of 3D images, that will be\ncompiled to realise objective 2, will be hosted on the servers of KU Leuven. In view of the\nexpected size of the database (500 gb), estimated cost will be 80 euro per year.\n7. Data sharing and re-use\n7.1. Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data\n(e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions or because of IP\npotential)?\nData on hit compounds will not be shared due to confidentiality. Research data will be published\nin open access papers.\n7.2. Which data will be made available after the end of the project?\n \n \nResearch data will be published in open access papers. Non-published data will be made\navailable upon official request.\n \n7.3. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nUpon request by mail Published data and reagents used for data generation are in principle\navailable upon request. Restrictions may be attached for sharing materials (eg MTA). Commercial\nuse will require official agreement negotiated with the help of LR&D. Non-published data (eg big\ndata on genomics and proteomics) can be shared upon request; restrictions (eg for commercial\nuse) can be imposed.\n7.4. When will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results Published data are available upon publication. Journals\nmay require deposition of data in repository. (eg PDB). Who will be able to access th\n7.5. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nMembers of Molecular Medicine will have access to the research data on the server. Hit\ncompounds will only be accessible to team members working on the project (restricted acces\nthrough passwords). After publication, data will be available upon request\n7.6. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nLimited costs.
