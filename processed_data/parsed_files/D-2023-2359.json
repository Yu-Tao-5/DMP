Knowledge from others and ourselves supports the hypothesis that\nintegrated sensorimotor therapy is beneficial for patients with mild motor and residual\nsomatosensory impairment. This project will evaluate this postulation. Firstly, we will\nvalidate our in-house developed sensorimotor robot-based protocol in 80 patients and 80\nhealthy controls. Secondly, a first therapy study (n=10) and subsequently pilot randomised\ncontrolled trial will be conducted in the chronic stage after stroke. The ROBUST trial will\nrecruit 66 community-living patients receiving either 48 hours of integrated robot-based\nsensorimotor therapy (n=22) or 48 hours of conventional therapy (n=22) or usual care\n(n=22) in four weeks. Between-group comparisons up to three months post-intervention\ninclude clinical (behavioural), robot-based (objective), and wearable-sensor (real-life)\nmeasurements to unravel the effect of sensorimotor therapy on life after stroke.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n01-03-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Knowledge from others and ourselves supports the hypothesis that integrated sensorimotor therapy is beneficial for patients with mild motor and residual somatosensory impairment. This project will evaluate this postulation. Firstly, we will validate our in-house developed sensorimotor robot-based protocol in 80 patients and 80 healthy controls. Secondly, a first therapy study (n=10) and subsequently pilot randomised controlled trial will be conducted in the chronic stage after stroke. The ROBUST trial will recruit 66 community-living patients receiving either 48 hours of integrated robot-based sensorimotor therapy (n=22) or 48 hours of conventional therapy (n=22) or usual care (n=22) in four weeks. Between-group comparisons up to three months post-intervention include clinical (behavioural), robot-based (objective), and wearable-sensor (real-life) measurements to unravel the effect of sensorimotor therapy on life after stroke.
