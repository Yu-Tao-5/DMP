Their poor understanding makes them difficult to diagnose and\nthus, challenging to treat or cure. The monogenic nature of several IEI converts them in the perfect target for precision medicine. In this\nproject, I focus in autosomal dominant (AD) signal transducer and activator of\ntranscription 1 (STAT1) gain-of-function (GOF), which presents with a range of mutations and a broad range of mostly unexplained\nphenotypes. STAT1 is a pivotal transcription factor in the immune response. In follow-up of our recent publications I propose to (i) assess\nthe underlying molecular mechanisms behind the responsiveness to JAK inhibitors treatment in the different mutations to improve their\nuse in the clinics; (ii) study whether the overexpression of STAT1 wild-type results in a\nGOF phenotype; and ultimately (iii) develop a proof-of-concept of a safer curative gene therapeutical approach for most, if not all, STAT1\nGOFs using the last advances in viral vector technology.\nAltogether, I aim to improve the quality of life of patients providing insights into the disease, optimize use of existing drugs and proof a\npotential gene therapeutical strategy for GOF disorders.\nLast modified: \n29-03-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Project Administrator: Cecilia Iglesias Herrero Grant number / URL: 1S07023N ID: 196832 Start date: 01-11-2022 End date: 31-10-2026 Project abstract: Inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are rare inherited disorders affecting the immune system presenting with increased susceptibility to pathogens and often associated with severe non-infectious comorbidities. Their poor understanding makes them difficult to diagnose and thus, challenging to treat or cure. The monogenic nature of several IEI converts them in the perfect target for precision medicine. In this project, I focus in autosomal dominant (AD) signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) gain-of-function (GOF), which presents with a range of mutations and a broad range of mostly unexplained phenotypes. STAT1 is a pivotal transcription factor in the immune response. In follow-up of our recent publications I propose to (i) assess the underlying molecular mechanisms behind the responsiveness to JAK inhibitors treatment in the different mutations to improve their use in the clinics; (ii) study whether the overexpression of STAT1 wild-type results in a GOF phenotype; and ultimately (iii) develop a proof-of-concept of a safer curative gene therapeutical approach for most, if not all, STAT1 GOFs using the last advances in viral vector technology. Altogether, I aim to improve the quality of life of patients providing insights into the disease, optimize use of existing drugs and proof a potential gene therapeutical strategy for GOF disorders.
