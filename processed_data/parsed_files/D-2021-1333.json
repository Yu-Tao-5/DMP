To treat movement disorders invasive neuromodulation\ntreatments are increasingly applied within DCP. Effective monitoring is extremely important for\nthe indication, evaluation and dosing of these interventions. Current methods to assess\nmovement disorders in DCP are insufficient and time consuming. In addition hospital\nmeasurements are not representative of the real-word situation, as movement disorders may\nvary considerably during the day, and increase with emotions or pain. Therefore, the aim of the\nstudy is to develop an objective measurement technique that can be used in everyday\nsituations. We suggest using supervised machine learning to automatically classifies dyskinetic\nmovement patterns and assess severity, using data extracted by markerless motion from videos.\nMarkerless motion tracking runs already automatically for common movements of abled bodied\npersons. We will 1) re-train an existing human model on about 3000 unique video sequences of\n130 children with DCP performing everyday tasks \nand 2) train algorithms that maps features\nfrom the videos to clinical scoring. The data consists of the raw videos, the extracted stickfigure\ndata from markerless motion tracking and the clinical scoring.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

The PI of the Amsterdam UMC (Annemieke Buizer) is responsible for the storage, backup and archiving of these data and access to the files. Processsed data of all studysites: scoring of the videos and extracted x,y-coordinates as will be uploaded to RedCap as .csv file This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 5 of 7 How is backup of the data provided? For RedCap required back-up procedures are in place. Back-up of the data on KU Leuven secure network drive will be provide with automatic daily backup procedures. Additionally, a mirror of the data is provided in a second ICTS data centre for business continuity or disaster recovery purposes. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Sufficient storage and backup capacity for the data as described in part 2 of this DMP is provided on the KU Leuven servers and networks, and participatin sites. This is about 50GB for the KU Leuven and about 30 GB for the Amsterdam UMC. What are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these costs be covered? AVI-DYS data will be stored on the L:/drive Revaki Campus Brugge in an project folder (AVI-DYS). About 50 GB of data storage is needed. On the L:/drive 5 Tb are available. The costs of â‚¬641,95/year/5 Tb for the storage on the L:/drive are covered by the reserach group. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Participant identities will be linked to data using an alphanumeric code. The separate and uniquely double pass-word coded \"Subject Identification Code List\", which matches identifying codes with the subjects' names, will be managed by the principle investigator (EM) and stored separately, using the Digital vault for private data service of the ICTS, KU Leuven. This system involves a secure and operating system in ICTS's special, secure environment for private data. The participant code of the other study sites will be kept at the local sites. Access via RedCap will only be provide to authorized persons of the study team. Acess to the video data on the secured KU Leuvenâ€™s secure internal servers can only be granted by the PI of this project (Elegast Monbaliu). Only the investigators of the studygroup will have access to these files. Access to the video data of Amsterdam UMC is granted by the local PI of this project (Annemieke Buizer) 6. Data preservation after the FWO project Which data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...). Final processed data from the all studiesites as well as the raw data of the KU Leuven will be stored for minimal 10 years. Archiving for the raw data on the Amsterdam UMC server is the responsibility of the local PI, concerning regulation data will be kept at least 15 years. Where will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)? The data will be archived on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures) (K-drive). The project documentation will also archived on the K-drive (i.e. transferred from the one-drive as used during the project). What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered? For the final year of the project an additional part in the budget is foreseen for data archiving (K- drive) for a period of minimal 10 years. The expected costs are â‚¬12,84/year/100Gb. Costs related to archiving will be covered for 50% by the Department of Biomedical Sciences and for 50% by the project. 7. Data sharing and reuse This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 6 of 7 Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Yes. Specify: Raw data (i.e. videos) cannot be shared public due to privacy restrictions. Which data will be made available after the end of the project? The extracted x,y-coordinates, clincial scoring and selected patientcharcteristics will be published in a public available Research Data Repository (RDR) of the KU Leuven) under a CC-BY license. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? In an Open Access repository Other (specify): Anonymised data will be published in a csv format in the RDR of the KU Leuven together with documentation. The code for processing the data will be released on Github and made citable with zenodo repository. The trained model for tracking of bodyparts and the models for prediction of dystonia and choreoathetosis will be published on zenodo. Raw data video will be eventually shared within the European Network of Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy upon request (if parents/participants have consented). When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? During the project: All involved researchers After the project: The data published in RDR will be accessable under a CC-BY license. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered? Data will not exceed 50 GB, storage up to 50 GB is possible in th RDR of the KU Leuven. 8. Responsibilities Who will be responsible for data documentation & metadata? The postdoc researcher (Helga Haberfehlner) associated with this project will be responsible for data documentation & metadata, under supervision of the PI. Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project? The postdoc researcher (Helga Haberfehlner) associated with this project will be responsible for data storage & back up, under supervision of the PI. Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ? The PI (Elegast Monbaliu) will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse. Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP? The PI bears the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP.
