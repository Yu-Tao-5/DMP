Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 02 July 2024 4 of 8 Shared data products will be accompanied by relevant keywords and metadata. Open data repositories, such as the Zenodo platform, support the mandatory and recommended terms of the DataCite and allow users to search by metadata terms. Tables and databases will include detailed descriptions of their columns and values. All newly developed source code materials for simulations and numerical models will be described in detail in open-access journal publications. Journal publications will use dedicated journal standards (e.g. keywords) to identify research context.

If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. Yes Interoperability and data reuse will be facilitated by using metadata and technical data formats that are non-proprietary and widely adopted by the community. As a general rule, files will be stored unencrypted. The DataCite scheme for metadata will be used when possible. For technical data, preference will be given to open hierarchical data formats that allow for the inclusion of metadata (self-describing), such as the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) format, which is commonly used in astronomy, or the HDF5 format, which is widely used by the scientific community. The FITS format has the advantage of being readily compatible with the Strasbourg Astronomical Data Center (CDS) public repository. All these formats maintain official C, C++, Fortran and Java APIs to read and manipulate data. Support for Python, Rust, Julia, MATLAB and many other languages is provided by a collection of well-established third-party public libraries.

Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Other (specify below) All data will be stored long-term on the Institute of Astronomy's backup system (onsite and offline). Additionally public repositories such as Zenodo, CDS and the virtual observatory will be used for the long-term storage of numerical models/simulations and final software releases. Archives in these platforms are projected to be maintained for at least twenty years. Metadata will be included to facilitate discovery by prospective users through these open platforms.
