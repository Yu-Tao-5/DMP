(use up to 700 characters)\n1. New data\nThe research will generate new observational textual and multimedia data. Those include the collection of primary research data: field notebooks; recorded interviews (audiotapes); photographs\nand videotapes. Primary data will include mostly handwritten fieldnotes. Analogue data will be digitized during the research, which involves the scan of field notebooks (PDF and JPEG), the\ntranscript of interviews (WORD), the storage of photographs (JPEG) and videotapes (AVI and WMV). Secondary data will include qualitative data analysis forms (WORD). The research also\nincludes filmmaking, which will generate multimedia files in MPEG-4 format. The various objectives will also generate secondary data linked to digital ethnography, such as videos, photos and\nstories on social networks (screenshots in PNG format, PDF files such as flyers, videos in WMV format).\n2. Existing data\nDuring the research, I will also reuse existing data (fieldnotes and recorded interviews) collected during earlier phases of the research.\n3. Personal data\nThe research involves mainly personal data.\nSpecify in which way the following provisions are in place in order to preserve the data during and at least 5 years after the end of the research? Motivate your answer. (use up to\n700 characters)\n1. New data\nThe expected total of digitized data generated is about 200GB. Digitized data will be stored on KU Leuven network drives as provided by KU Leuven IT Services (ICTS), which ensures automatic\nback-up procedures and is compliant with standard security protocols. Digitized data will be uploaded and archived for at least ten years on KU Leuven Servers (Reserch Data Repository). They\nwill be coded according to a pattern generated by the data (data-driven approach) and documented in a reference document (Readme). Only the resercher and the supervisor will have access to\nthe digitized data, but they will be made available upon motivated request from peers and if allowed by the informed consent of participants. The researcher will keep the physical materials for\nacademic re-use, if the participants consent to this, and if the storage is safe (see security measures).\n2. Existing data\nExisting data is stored on the server of the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology, Germany, which ensures high protection and storage with no time limit. The data are coded directly in\nscanned fieldnotes (colour code) and in a reference document (Xcel file). \nWhat’s the reason why you wish to deviate from the principle of preservation of data and of the minimum preservation term of 5 years? (max. 700 characters)\nThe research will stick to the minimum preservation term of 5 years.\nAre there issues concerning research data indicated in the ethics questionnaire of this application form? Which specific security measures do those data require? (use up to 700\ncharacters)\nThe research involves the collecting and processing of personal data. Data storage and access will follow the General Data Protection Regulation. This will require that participants give informed\nconsent and know about processes of pseudonymization. Personal data files and folders will be encrypted and safely secured on KULeuven central archive servers.  Processes of\npseudonymization will involve: (1) hiding of names, dates of birth and other personal information in field notebooks and interviews (2) blurring of photos, videos and tapes via editing softwares (MS\nPaint, Adobe Photoshop, Audacity and softwares like Morph VOX or Voxal). Participants will be associated with a code/identification key.\nRegarding data protection in case of equipment loss (stolen computer, stolen recorder): recorded files are directly stored on a computer and deleted on the recorder, and computer access is done\nvia password \nand \ndigital fingerprint, which protects it from hacking.\nWhich other issues related to the data management are relevant to mention? (use up to 700 characters)\nA PRET (Privacy and Ethics) application will be submitted for the processing of personal data. Regarding filmmaking, participants will provide consent to be filmed and feature in the film, which will\nunavoidably imply disclosure of identities. However, the researcher will first disclose the film to participants and ensure their consent before publicizing the final result to an external audience.\nFinally, as per KU Leuven data management regulations, all data will require to gain consent from research participants to preserve data for ten years.\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Because of the sensitive nature of collected data, I will guarantee the anonymity of the research participants and the confidentiality of the collected data. Therefore, I will not make the data available for reuse, I will not share data with other scholars, the public or other actors in order to safeguard the anonymity, the security and the privacy of the informants. Most of the data of the research project (interviews, photos, videos) will be openly available. The data collected will be mainly produced by interviews that will include confidential and sensitive data. The data will be anonymously published in academic papers or communicated in lectures and conferences. The other data (analytical forms, social media content, which is already public) will be made available upon request. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes, Ethical aspects The security of the informants will be guaranteed by restricted access to personal data (interviews, photos, videos) and anonymization of data. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. I will use the KU Lueven Research Data repositary for all data, with confidentiality restrictions. When will the data be made available? Upon publication of research results. This may not coincide with the end of the project. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. The project will not generation interoperational, reusable or replicable data. Therefore, I do not intend to use a data usage licence. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? I do not except additional costs for data sharing. 6. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project?
