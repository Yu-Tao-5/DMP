Raw experimental data includes the storage of original physical records and digital files in their native specific software formats. These raw data files are systematically stored in a dedicated project folder on the J-drive (working drive) or L-drive (large storage drive), hosted by KU Leuven servers. Within this folder, data are organized into subfolders based on the experiment or method type (e.g., physical activity registration, cardiopulmonary exercise test) and further categorized by assessment points. Each raw data file is also uploaded to the REDCap database, where a corresponding link (key identifier) to its backup on the J-drive/L-drive is maintained. Processed data are managed within the REDCap database, which contains a comprehensive data dictionary, measurement units, and key identifiers linking to the original data files. The Patient Identifier Record (PIR) The Patient Identifier Record (PIR) is stored separately from subject recruitment files on a different location within the KU Leuven server to ensure the protection of private data, under the supervision of the Principal Investigator (PI).

Data on anthropometrics, vascular function, physical fitness, eye pressure, blood pressure,...will be immediately digitalized by entering the values in the RedCap database hosted on the KU Leuven servers. Only researchers working on the ACHIEVE project will have access to the RedCap for the duration of the project. 2 . A copy of KU Leuven digitalized files will also be stored on the J-drive of the KU Leuven CVEP research group (hosted by KU Leuven servers) within the password protected ACHIEVE folder. 3 . Paper copies, including informed consent forms will be stored in a secured locker at the offices of O&N4 (Herestraat 49; lokaal 04.419 - 3000 Leuven) for KU Leuven after being digitalized (scanned) and saved in the RedCap database and the J- drive. 4 . Large data files (ABPM data, vascular health imaging data) will be stored on large storage L-drive hosted on KU Leuven server. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Paper documents will be digitized and then uploaded to both the REDCap database (hosted on KU Leuven servers) and the J- drive on the KU Leuven server network. The original paper copies will also be securely stored in a locked cabinet. This ensures that three versions of the data are consistently maintained. Both the REDCap database, J-drive and L-drive are automatically backed up through KU Leuven’s IT services. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Currently, 4 TB of storage space is available, with additional budget allocated should further capacity be required. However, based on current projections, no additional storage is expected to be necessary. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The pseudonymised digital data—meaning it is coded and contains no directly identifying personal information—will be securely stored within the University infrastructure, specifically in the REDCap database hosted on KU Leuven servers. Access to this database is strictly controlled by the Principal Investigator (Véronique Cornelissen), who determines access permissions and user roles. Similarly, access to the J-drive is exclusively managed by the PI. The subject identification code list, which links participant names to their unique codes, is protected by a dual-password system, stored separately, and solely managed by the PI.

What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The costs for the REDCap database are 80 euro/year and will be covered by the bench fee of the PhD-student. The J-drive is covered partially by departemental funding (CVEP-drive) and partially (300 euro/year) by the research group (CV imaging data) of which the research team is part of.
