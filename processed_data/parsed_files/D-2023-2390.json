Simulations: the simulation code version and the actual simulated configuration (detector set-up, beam line configuration, ion trap assembly will be associated with each generated data set. For the beam line simulations, t he number of particles generated and their initial profile will also be saved in standard SimIon formats. 2. Offline data: the source of the reference of off-line used material will be systematically noted in the logbooks. If applicable, the laser light generation conditions and laser light operation parameters (laser power, laser wavelength, calibration procedures), the radiation detector settings (bias voltage, connection mode), the isotope separator settings (mass, high voltage, target ion source parameters) will be noted. 3. Online data: the production protocol including target number, target and ion source parameters (including the laser parameters of the ion source if applicable), charge trapping and breeding parameters and accelerator parameters will be recorded for the entire data set . Next to this, where applicable, the laser parameters, the mass separator parameters, the timing sequence, the digital data acquisition parameters, the countrates and dead times, the calibration procedures will be noted in the logbook for every data set generated. The documentation and metadata for points 1 and 2 will be registered in the off-line logbooks and analysis books, for point3 will be collected via the online e-log systems organized with the Institute of Nuclear and Radiation Physics and at CERN. 4. Theoretical simulations: results of theoretical calculations will be stored after publication. This includes the equation of state of dense nuclear matter for different effective interactions and nuclear structure properties as well as neutron-, proton- and alpha-induced reaction rates for about 8000 nuclei. It will also include the atomic opacity tables for all elements between Ca and Lr for neutral up to 3rd ionization stages. Finally, the stellar parameters for benchmarked stars will be provided in a table format. The newly calculated atomic data will be used to update the DREAM and DESIRE atomic databases maintained by the Atomic Physics and Astrophysics group at UMONS. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: The data result from many different detector types: Germanium and Silicon semiconductor detectors, photo multipliers, Multi Channel Plate detectors, Photodiodes. They are used in several different configurations. As such there is no existing (industrial) standard for the (wide variety of) data types that is collected. The detailed metadata were described above. 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data.☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☐ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☒ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☒ Other: data generated at KU Leuven will be stored on servers from the department of Physics and Astronomy (Natuurkunde &Sterrenkunde - N&S). Data generated at CERN will be stored on the CASTOR server at CERN. Data from theoretical calculations and simulations will be stored at ULB and U Mons. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? ☐ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back-ups I make (specify) ☒ Other (specify): Data stored at CERN are backed up following the CERN general data management plan. Data stored at KU Leuven are backed up on a daily base by the departmental IT team (N&S) Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No The N&S IT team continuously upgrades its storage capacity to always accommodate the growing demand for data storage. At CERN, the data generated by this project is negligible compared to the data generated by other experiments (e.g. LHC expeirments) and there is therefore no problem with data storage. If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data All data are stored on servers with password-protected access. At KU Leuven, only members of the research team have access to the data and a clear Data Management Plan guideline has been deployed within the group to ensure that raw data are never overwritten. At CERN, only members of the relevant experiment have access to the data . FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?The costs for data storage at N&S KU Leuven are covered centrally with budgets from all research institutes of the department, including the ZAP from IKS. They are therefore not evaluated per project. When necessary, the expansion of the storage capacity is performed with funding from the active projects and from the departmental budget line . At CERN, access to storage is completely free for CERN generated data , offered as part of the basic infrastructure that CERN provides for research. The costs for data storage of the theoretical calculations and simulations is very limited and will be supplied by ULB and U Mons services. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) At KU Leuven, the raw data and the secondary data are kept in a shared folder for the research team - accessible even after the end of contract of temporary personnel (PhD, post-doc). At CERN, data is kept on CASTOR for 15 years. At ULB and U Mons, data from the theoretical calculations and simulations will be kept at the resp. research team Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Preservation is considered part of the general investment in data storage by the N&S IT policy as such these costs are included in the prognoses of the departmental budget lines as well as in the budget lines of the research institutes. 6.
