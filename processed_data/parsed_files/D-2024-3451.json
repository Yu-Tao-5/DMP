In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) Only data which were already published/mentioned in papers will be made available after the end of the project for public use. However, for a possible continuation of this research project, all unpublished data will be available in the laboratory of Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy. In this way, data can still be accessed on demand. In addition, data will be shared between close collaborators when necessary If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Everyone will be able to request access to published data by e-mail. Nevertheless, prof. Zeger Debyser (PI) and Kune Herrebosch (FWO fellow) will, under consultation, evaluate if the request will be accepted. For example, ongoing collaborations will, by great change, be accepted while competitive labs will be denied access.
