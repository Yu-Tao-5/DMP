The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co -ordination \noffice of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of t he project by the relevant expert panel.  Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.  \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan.

It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all materials tha t need proper management because they are valuable, diffic ult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentatio n/metadata. RDM Guidance on data If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type. Clinical data Master@Heart: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsem -2021 -001048 Other retrospective, clinical datasets: exist in the hospital, but no publications for these specific datasets exist. CARP studio software: https://numericor.at/rlb/wordpress/resources/ Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number . ☒ Yes, human subject data ; provide SMEC or EC a pproval number: Ethical approval for the use of the clinical data in this study was granted by the Ethics Committee Research UZ/KU, under reference number S6133 and S68896. ☐ Yes, animal data ; provide ECD reference number: ☐ Yes, dual use; provide approva l number : ☐ No Additional information : This pertains to the 5 clinical datasets. Will you process personal data4? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number). ☒ Yes (provide PRET G -number or EC S -number below) ☐ No Additional information: Personal data are the ECG s, imaging records and demographics of all 5 clinical datasets. Ethical approval for the use of the clin ical data in this study was granted by the Ethics Committee Research UZ/KU, under reference number S6133 and S68896. 4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9 Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer , for example spin - offs, commercial exploitation, … )? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes , please comment : Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements , research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata . All code that is shared, will be shared with code documentation and README files , containing a link to the paper describing the project where the code is used . Example code for usage of the SSM s, generative AI models and surrogate models will be provided to facilitate (re)use , in addition to a link to the paper describing their creation . For the synthetic meshes and synthetic and simulated ECG databases , a clear description of the data format is added to the Zenodo repository , with a link to the paper describing their creation . Clinical data: - CT and MRI scans: DICOM format , with imbedded metadata - ECG data: xls files with descriptive headers - demographics: xls files with descriptive headers FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☒ Yes ☒ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : Clinical data: DICOM If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: Synthetic and simulated ECG databases and synthetic meshes: Since the data are synthetically generated and do not originate from real patients, no direct patient metadata is included. When synthetic data are generated conditionally (e.g., age or diagnosis -based generation), metadata will reflect the conditioning parameters or sampled distributions used, and will be explicitly labeled as synthetic or statistically derived. This approach promotes transparency and avoids misinterpretation while enabling use in demographic - specific analysis or benchmarking. 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data. ☐ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I -drive) ☐ Teams ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on -premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ ManGO ☐ Digital vault ☒ Other: Secure research server with controlled access managed by ESAT.

Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes, the available storage on the ESAT servers and in the ICTS data center is larger than the maximum estimated volume of the datasets. ☐ No If no, please specify : How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES ) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . Guidance on security for research data The clinical datasets are stored on the ESAT servers, where access is regulated by an access control list (ACL) that grants: - read/write access to the project owner - read-only access to specific users The ACL is managed by the project owner. Client computers can access the data using SMB2 from specific IP ranges of NFSv4 from specific (IT -managed) systems. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? All expected costs will be automatically covered by ESAT, the host department. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12 Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project?
