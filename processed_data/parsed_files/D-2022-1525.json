The project uses empirical-ethical\napproach, combining qualitative and conceptual research methods. The nature of collected data\nwill include content analysis of electronic tracking device company websites, personal data as\npart of a qualitative interview study, and personal data as part of a focus group study. These\ndata will be used to directly inform and shape the development of the final framework.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. Data Description\nWhat data will you collect or create? Fill out the table below and/or describe.\n Type of data\nFormat \n Volume\nHow created? \nWP1. Archived\nwebsites \nPDF of websites. \n300 -\n500 MB\nIncluded webpages will be\nsaved as PDF's by using the\nprint function of the\nFirefox web browser. \n WP2. Qualitative\ninterview data: 20\ninterviews\nAudio-recorded and stored\nuncompressed Mp4 format;\ntranscribed into MS word\nformat\n 10-15\nGB\n Interviews conducted over\nMicrosoft Team meetings. \nWP3. Systematic\nreview - Academic\narticles\nPDF files stored and catalogued\nin an Endnote library\n300-\n500 MB \nCollected via systematic review\nmethods. \nWP4. Qualitative focus\ngroup data: 3 focus\ngroups of 10 persons\n Audio-recorded and stored\nuncompressed Mp4 format;\ntranscribed into MS word\nformat\n 10-15\nGB\nThree separate focus groups\nconducted in person.  \nDo you intend to reuse existing data?\nNo. All data used in this project will be collected by the researcher.\nDo you use personal data (i.e. all data possibly identifying an individual)?\nYes\nThe interview study (WP2) and focus group study (Wp4) involve personal data.\nThe interview study (WP2) methods and protocol have undergone ethical review at KU Leuven\nSociaal-Maatschappelijke Ethische Commissie (SMEC): reference number:  G-2021-3903\n \n2. Documentation and Metadata\nDescribe the documentation that will be created for the data. This section deals with\nthe way in which you will document how the dataset was created and subsequently\nprocessed.\nOverall, each study meta-data will be stored on the institutional OneDrive account of the Senior\nResearcher. A read me file will be created for the saved data describing the contents and how\nthey are organized. This will include a glossary of acronyms used in the file system. \n1. For the systematic review, the methodology and methods will be reported in detail within a\nword document (e.g., the inclusion and exclusion criteria). The search strings used will be\npreserved in individual word documents named after the database for which the string is meant\n(e.g., Embase search string.docx). Individual conceptual schemes will be provided for each\nincluded article, and a combined overall conceptual scheme will be preserved in a Miccrosoft\nWord document. The overall scheme and demographics of the included articles will be stored as\ntables in a Microsoft Excel workbook. \n2. For the website content analysis: a detailed description of the website selection process,\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 4\nincluding the date on which websites were archived will be recorded in a Microsoft Word file. A\nfull PDF image of each included webpage will be made and preserved. \n3. For the interview study: A codebook will be created that will contain the following information -\nLabel or name of the code, name of the person that has conducted the coding, date of the\ncoding, definitions and descriptions of codes and concepts, information on the relations between\nthe codes and concepts that will be used. The codebook will be created in Excel, and descriptions\nwill be integrated into the excel workbook itself. Additionally, a short report will be created\ndetailing the conditions of the interview. A pseudonymous transcript will be made from the\nrecorded interviews (note: audio files will be destroyed at conclusion of study and not preserved)\nand preserved in a Microsoft Word document. Each participant will receive a code and the related\nreports and transcripts will be placed into a folder named after their code. \n4. For the focus group studies: A codebook will be created containing the following information-\nlabel or name of the code, name of the person that has conducted the coding, date of the coding,\ndefinitions and descriptions of codes and concepts, information on the relations between codes\nand concepts that will be used. The codebook will be created in excel and given a descriptive file\nname (e.g., KUL ETD interview codebook). Pseudonymous transcripts will be created of each\nfocus group (note: audio files will be destroyed at conclusion of study and not preserved) in a\nMicrosoft Word document. Data created from each focus group will be stored together under a\nfile with the name and date of the focus group (e.g., Focus group 1 - 19/02/2022). \n \n \nDescribe the metadata for the data. This section deals with metadata: information\ncontained in your dataset about the research data.\nThe metadata will be reported following the KU Leuven research data repository template in a\nread me file. \nThe read me file will consist of at minimum: Title of the data set, Authors of the data set\n(including family names, ORCID ID's, organization affiliation (e.g. Associatie KU Leuven), and\ndepartment/faculty affiliation. The FWO grant associated with the collection of the data set.\nContact information for the senior researcher will be included. A description with a summary of\nthe purpose, nature, and scope of the data set, a list of defining key terms used in the data set. A\nfull bibliographic citation to any publications that are based on the data set. Additionally, the\ntechnical format of included files (e.g., .docx, .xml, .pdf) will be included. \n \n \n3. Ethical, Legal and Privacy Issues\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data?\nWP2 (interview study) and WP4 (Focus group study) include research involving human\nparticipants and therefore certain ethical issues. \nThere are two issues related to data storage and preservation. First, all data will undergo a\npseudonymization process whereby identifying data (e.g., name or place of employment) will be\npermanently removed from the transcript and other documents and replaced by a unique\nrandom code. The key to the data will be stored separately from the pseudonymized data and\nwill be only available to the primary researcher. The key is preserved in the case a participant\nwishes to exercise their rights to access, rectify, or erase data. \nParticipants have the right to withdraw their consent to participate any time before, during, or\nafter participation; however, the data is being processed under the GDPR on the basis of public\ninterest and therefore relevant data may be utilized if essential to the study. \nCollected, pseudonymized data will be stored for a length of ten years, in accordance with the\npolicies of KU Leuven. \nAs of June 7th, 2022, the interview study has undergone ethical review by the Sociaal-\nMaatschappelijke Ethische Commissie (SMEC) (see file: G-2021-3903). The focus group study will\nbe submitted to SMEC when appropriate. \nDid you consider all issues about copyrights and IPR?\nThe data will not contain trade secrets, patentable inventions, or be viable for commercial\nexploitation. \nAre the collected data considered to be â€œdata containing personal informationâ€​\nand are all the requirements about the collection of these data met?\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 4\n The interview study and the focus group study will involve collecting personal data: name,\nbusiness address, email, phone number, age, sex, and professional history. Additionally, data\ndefined as \"special category data\" under the GDPR may also be collected. During an interview or\nduring a focus group, if participants decide to discuss them, philosophical or religious positions\nmay be collected and included in the transcript. \nAll participants will be informed of the personal and special data that will or may be collected\nduring their participation, they will be informed that their data will be stored for a period of 10\nyears after the end of the study, and that collected data may still be used if they withdraw their\nconsent. \nAs of June 7th, 2022, the interview study (WP2) has undergone ethical review by the Sociaal-\nMaatschappelijke Ethische Commissie (SMEC) (see file: G-2021-3903). The focus group study\n(WP4) will be submitted to SMEC at the appropriate moment.  \n4. Data storage and Backup during Research\nHow and where will the data be stored during research?\nIn a cloud service offered by the university\nDuring research activities, data will be stored on the PhD student's KU Leuven institutional\nMicrosoft OneDrive cloud storage account. \nWhich back-up procedures are in place?\nDuring research activities, data will be stored on the KU Leuven OneDrive cloud storage account\nof the PhD student, this service takes automatic backups of data.  \nDescribe the data security procedures and who has access to the data.\nTo ensure data security, KU Leuven standard procedures and good practices of data\nmanagement will be strictly followed. Additionally, only the PhD researcher, conducting the\ninterviews, will have access to personal identifying information of participants in the interview\nstudy (WP2) and focus group study (WP4). \n5. Data selection and Preservation after Research\nWhat is the long-term preservation plan for these dataset(s)?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers, with automatic back-up procedures,\nfor at least 10 years in conformity with the KU Leuven RDM Policy. \nData Selection: Which data will have long time value for the research and will be\npreserved?\nArchived websites, conceptual schemes and merged conceptual schemes from WP1. Transcripts,\nconceptual schemes, merged conceptual schemes, coded transcripts, and code books from both\nWP2 and WP3. \n6. Data Sharing\nAre there any restrictions for sharing the data?\nAudio recordings of interviews (WP2), and focus groups (WP4) will be destroyed at the conclusion\nof each study as participants do not give consent for the data to be kept beyond the individual\nwork package. \nIf there are no restrictions, which mechanisms will be in place to assure that the data\nare discoverable, accessible and intelligible?\nQuestion not answered.\nHow will you share the data?\nRepository\nData will be stored in the KU Leuven Research Data Repository.\nWith whom will the data be shared?\nOn request\nAccess to data will be considered upon receipt of a request explaining the planned reuse.
