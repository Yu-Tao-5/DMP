In\nthe future, building structures must be re-used possibly in combination with changes of their\nintended function. This research work will develop an assessment procedure for existing structures.\nAfter collecting the necessary historical data, the procedure focuses on the modelling of load\narrangements through linear FEA. Despite being the starting point of further (advanced) analyses,\ndisproportionally little research attention has been given to this. Often, simplified methods are used\nwhich results in a conservative outcome. Starting from the results of the linear load model, a\ncoupling will be proposed with a non-linear FEA to perform a structural analysis. In this non-linear\nFEA (NLFEA), the possibility to use membrane actions in ambient conditions and system behaviour is\nresearched. To validate the proposed mathematical models a real test structure will be build on a\nscale of 1/3, which allows for model updating and perform test till the level of robustness checks.\nThe use of NLFEA in structural analysis requires also the study of reliability levels and model\nuncertainties to obtain a credible working procedure.\nLast modified: \n20-04-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
