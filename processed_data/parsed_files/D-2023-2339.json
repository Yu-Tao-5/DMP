SusMat: Detailed lab notes will be kept in an electronic lab notebook (RSpace) server, located on premise at KU Leuven. Serial numbers will be used to link these lab notes to data stored in the SET zone of the KU Leuven iRODS storage system (ManGO) through the metadata catalogue. Additional metadata will be extracted from data files and added to this catalogue (dependent on the experimental technique), along with the project identifier to ensure that all data is findable. All data will be exported from proprietary software in a format that is open-source and/or human readable to allow continued use in the event of deprecation of the proprietary software. WP2, Department of Physics: Data in WP2 and parts of data acquired in WP1 and 3 in the Nanobiophysics Labs (C. Bartic) will be kept on a shared secured network drive (fysad.fys.kuleuven.be) and will be uploaded and updated by a member of the research team every time a new experiment takes place or data is being generated. The names of the files will be structured in a comprehensible way: Experiment type/date/main parameters used. In addition, data will be stored in a folder per experimental setup, the type of investigated sample and the acquision/generation date. The analysis files will contain notes describing the analysis procedure and mention which original data files are included.

WP3, Department of Development and Regeneration: All experiments (for WP3, but also WP1 and WP2) will be documented in an electronic laboratory notebook using the online tool Benchling. The notes will include the experimental set-up and protocols used, information on the (biological) samoles used, the raw data obtained from the experiment, location of samples generated during the experiment and possible remarks by the researcher.

How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? For the Nanobiophysics data, only team members have access to the shared files. Access is controlled by the ICT team at the department of physics. The data stored in Benchling and on the university's servers are password controlled and can only be accessed when granted permission. SusMat: Data stored in ManGO and RSpace is protected by KUL central login with mandatory MFA.

What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Data generated by C. Bartic's lab members: Sufficient storage volume is available in the recently updated departmental network storage infrastructure. The cost for additional storage volume following the current cost model is 1316 € for 20 TB for 5 years, which would give a cost of 2632 € for 20TB to be stored for 10 years.For active data management, the ManGO 1TB project folder will cost 35 €/Y, 140 € for the project duration. As an alternative/comparison, large volume storage from central ICTS amounts to 20884 € for 20TB to be stored for 10 years. A yearly budget of ± 2500 euro/year will be reserved for data storage, to be provided by current project or running projects after current project completion. Excepted costs for the data storage and backup for the team of H. Declercq is estimated at 2000 euro/year that will be provided by the current project.

The team of H. Declercq will retain the data for at least 10 years. Due to physical preservation issues of biological samples, physical data that can be easily reproduced is not retained longer than necessary.
