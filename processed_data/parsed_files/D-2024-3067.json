It is generally accepted that ethylene gas rapidly diffuses out of the plant tissue where it is synthesized. However,\nbased on preliminary calculations and experimental data, we believe that ethylene gas can also be transported over longer distances via\nthe phloem vasculature. This hypothesis is corroborated by historical experiments using radiolabeled ethylene gas, which showed that\nethylene can travel long distances in plants. In this proposal, we want to provide experimental evidence that phloem-mediated long-\ndistance ethylene gas transport exists and leads to a systemic ethylene response. Besides showing the proof-of-concept, we also want\nto investigate the role and function of this new transport phenomenon. We believe that (a)biotic stress at a particular leaf, can trigger\nlong-distance ethylene gas transport, to activate ethylene responses in remote leaves. This will be investigated using a variety of\nmolecular and genetic techniques, to establish the role of long-distance ethylene gas transport in mediating systemic stress resilience in\nplants.\nID: \nID: \n210168\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-10-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n30-09-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n19-11-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
