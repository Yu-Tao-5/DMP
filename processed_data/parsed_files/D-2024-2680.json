This Arabization\nhappened progressively and unevenly and led to tensions. How can Christians express their theology in the sacred language of Islam? The figure of\nElias of Nisibis, an archbishop of the Church of the East at the beginning of the second millennium, embodies this linguistic dilemma. Although he\npenned most of his works in Arabic, he also negotiated the use of the Syriac language in an Arabic literary context and argued for the superiority of\nSyriac over Arabic. He is the author of an Arabic-Syriac lexicon, the “Book of the Interpreter” (Kit\nā\nb al-Tarjum\nā\nn). This project focuses on Elias of\nNisibis and this lexicon as a starting point for addressing broader questions about language change among Middle Eastern Christians. I will first\nconduct a thorough analysis of the theological terms found in this lexicon and compare them to the other works by Elias of Nisibis in order to create a\nmore comprehensive analysis of his literary corpus. Then, I will contrast his theological vocabulary with that of his contemporaries. I will finally\nexamine the reception of the “Book of the Interpreter” in later centuries as a means of tying this work to Middle Eastern Christian reflection on\nlanguage change that has endured from Elias' day down to the present.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n26-07-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
