According to good laboratory practices, each researcher involved in the project, provides detailed descriptions of his/her experimental data acquisition and/or on the generation of new biological materials in his/her (electronic) laboratory notebooks as appropriate, thereby cross-referring any paper notes that might be used to the electronic files containing the data, and to the biological samples used. Protocols and products used are indicated and cross-referenced in the laboratory notebooks. Each experiment in the (E)LN will contain all data files with the exclusion of the microscopy data file (this will be stored on an external drive and cross-referenced) a metadata file with information about the specific dataset or links to other datasets including unique identifier numbers is included in the ELN. Revision history is maintained. JSON formatted files with metadata are included in the ELN. The researchers involved will store work files on the J-drive or the KU Leuven Enterprise onedrive instead of his/her own laptop hard drive to prevent loss of data. Cell lines will be documented in a standardized way inside the LMCS cell line database (format: .xlsx; location: J-drive) Write access only by the personnel affiliated to our cell culture facility. In 2025 this information will be transferred to the biobank database of the UZ/KU Leuven. Plasmids in the LMCS lab will be documented in the ELN database. Information including DNA sequences of primers or other constructs or amino acid sequences of peptides generated or obtained during the project: .txt and .docx files and in ELN.

Yes Metadata will be used. During and after the project all data is available on the LMCS-shared network J-drive and/or via the electronic laboratory notebooks of the researchers involved. This will make the data available to researcher within the research group. Data and all other information related to peer-reviewed publications will, at present, be archived on the LMCS Archive K- drive (1 TB presently available, can be expanded whenever necessary) as soon as possible after publication. We will also make use of the KU Leuven research data repository. Data will be prepared according to the guidelines set by the university (DataCite). 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Data is stored on network drives of the KU Leuven (J-drive, K-drive) with automatic backup at least once per day for these drives by ICT. Experimental data is also stored in our electronic lab notebooks and are backed up once a day. The individual researcher will also back-up experiments of the ELN to their respective onedrive of the KULeuven as a secondary back-up option. Microscopy data will be saved on external hard drives due to the amount of data storage needed. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up?
