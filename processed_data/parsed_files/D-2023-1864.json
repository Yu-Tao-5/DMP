The\nmucosal immune cell activation induces through local and systemic effects altered gastric sensorimotor function,\naltered gut peptide release and neuro-inflammation. These events induce impaired nutrient tolerance and upper\ngastrointestinal, systemic and psychological symptoms.\nLast modified: \n29-06-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Big files such as images are stored on the sharepoint online drives.\nMicroscopy data: All original recordings and their metadata will be stored in one copy on external harddrives, which will be labeled by projectname, subproject,\nexperiment, data and experimenter initials. Since most of the images are highly experimental and explorative, there is no need to keep a copy of the original data.\nHowever, upon first analysis the images that are judged of sufficient quality to derive conclusive data, will be analysed as saved on the researcher’s computer with a\nbackup either on a local external harddrive or via the LUNA network. Exchange of data between will happen via the LUNA network, which keeps track of versions and\nassures safe backups.

Grant number / URL: Methusalem D-2023-1864 ID: 200585 Start date: 01-01-2023 End date: 30-09-2028 Project abstract: Based on our own previous research, recent literature observations and emerging data from clinical trials, we propose an overall pathophysiological scheme that attributes key roles to increased mucosal permeability, triggered by local and systemic stressors, allowing luminal factors to maintain a vicious circle with activation of eosinophils and mast cells. The mucosal immune cell activation induces through local and systemic effects altered gastric sensorimotor function, altered gut peptide release and neuro-inflammation. These events induce impaired nutrient tolerance and upper gastrointestinal, systemic and psychological symptoms. Last modified: 29-06-2023 Created using DMPonline.be.

Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. No Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material or Data transfer agreements, Research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. No Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. No Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). All protocols (docx.file) and accompanying result files (.xlsx,.tif files) containing the key to identify the experimental samples are available on a shared drive from our lab managed by the KU Leuven and/or UZ Leuven. Only members from the team have access to these folders. All ethical documents are available on the shared drive from the research groups involved. An overview of the samples stored in the biobank is available on the shared drive from our research group. For the microscopic image data that will be recorded: recording parameters (powers, excitation and emission wavelength), dimensions, image type, bit-depth, pixel sizes and microscope settings, will be stored. Either in a metafile accompanying the data (with identical filename) or embedded in the tiff header. The experimental protocols, stimulation settings, temperatures of the physiological experiments that will be performed during this projected will be described in detail in a lab book and referred in a ReadMe text file that will accompany the recorded data. Similarly for the processed and analyzed data, all parameters used to arrive to the results are stored within the image format. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 29 June 2023 13 of 16 No Metadata standards are typically not used within our lab group. We do have a minimal set of requirements that will be followed in order to ensure standardization and possibility to reinterpret and reuse the data when necessary and permitted. For the microscopic imaging data we do adhere to metadata standards: Images will be stored in *.ome tiff format, which enables storing a multitude of microscope and recording parameters. For the more experimental imaging paradigms for which actual changes are made to the instrumentation, the metadata will be stored in accompanying txt or csv files. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? ManGO Other (specify below) Sharepoint online Digital Vault Shared network drive (J-drive) All generated data are stored on the shared network drive platforms of the KU Leuven and UZ Leuven that are only accessible to the members of the research teams (only for PhD, postdocs, technicians not for master students). Big files such as images are stored on the sharepoint online drives. Microscopy data: All original recordings and their metadata will be stored in one copy on external harddrives, which will be labeled by projectname, subproject, experiment, data and experimenter initials. Since most of the images are highly experimental and explorative, there is no need to keep a copy of the original data. However, upon first analysis the images that are judged of sufficient quality to derive conclusive data, will be analysed as saved on the researcher’s computer with a backup either on a local external harddrive or via the LUNA network. Exchange of data between will happen via the LUNA network, which keeps track of versions and assures safe backups. Within an FWO IRI project (FBI, Pieter Vanden Berghe co-promoter), we are investigating future overarching datastorage and datamanagement solutions based on the IRODS / ManGo pipelines. How will the data be backed up? Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution Backup is secured daily on servers of the University and the University Hospital. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, explain how this will be taken care of. Yes All groups involved have sufficient data storage capacity available. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Only the PIs are authorized to give access to the members of his/her team to the shared drives of the KU Leuven and/or the UZ Leuven. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The costs are considered to be budgeted within the working cost items of the project. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for 10 years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) KU Leuven RDR Data will be stored on archive drives of the university. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 29 June 2023 14 of 16 What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? These costs are considered to be budgeted within the work costs of the project and maintained for longer duration by the PIs after the end of the project. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) Anonimized data can be made available for further analyses in line with the terms of the ICFs and following advice from the relevant local ethics committees. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. The anonimized data sets can be shared within the TARGID research unit or shared upon request. In such case, data will be available after signing a data sharing agreement. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. No no restrictive factors Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. Other (specify below) A specific repository will be chosen after the publication strategy is known as some journal request specific repositories. When will the data be made available? Upon publication of research results Only after publication of the research results in a peer-reviewed journal. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) Data usage licences will be discussed with LRD before any licences are granted. Similarly, when DTAs or MTAs are discussed, this will always be after consulting and collaborating with LRD. Do you intend to add a persistent identifier (PID) to your dataset(s), e.g. a DOI or accession number? If already available, please provide it here. ​​Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository Depending on the data repository and the type of data that would be made available, a unique identifier will be added to the data set. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? If shipment of data or material is required by an other study group abroad, after approval the costs of drafting of MTA/DTA and shipment itself will be covered by the requesting party. Exchange of microscopic imaging data can be done via BELNET and no extra cost. Responsibilities Created using DMPonline.be.
