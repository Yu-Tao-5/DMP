The biological effect of natural\nprocessing of CXCL10 at the C-terminus is largely unknown, but will be uncovered in\nthis project. CXCL10 is abundantly present in the circulation and inflamed joints in\nvarious inflammatory arthropathies and is generally acknowledged to contribute to\nselective leukocyte recruitment towards the inflamed joints. However, whether\nCXCL10 is biologically active, inactive due to processing or even acts as a CXCR3\nantagonist in these diseases is uncharted territory, since no methods exist to\ndiscriminate CXCL10 proteoforms in biological samples. This project aims to develop\nsuch method and to quantify endogenous CXCL10 proteoforms in synovial fluids and\nplasma of patients suffering from inflammatory arthropathies. As such, this research\nwill unravel the role of CXCL10 in these destructive arthropathies and pave the way\ntowards the identification of a novel therapeutic target.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
