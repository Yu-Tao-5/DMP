The study will also encompass exploratory\nassessments of social reciprocity and stress physiology during semi-structured socio-interactive\nsessions administered throughout the trial, allowing objective quantifications in more\nâ€˜naturalistic settingsâ€™ for capturing treatment responses. \nConsidering recent notions of the\nimportance of context in which oxytocin treatment is administered, the oxytocin treatment will\nbe combined with targeted semi-structured socio-interactive training sessions. The standardized\npairing of the oxytocin nasal spray administrations with social training, will allow further\nelucidating whether clinical efficacy can possibly be augmented from administering oxytocin in a\nsupportive socio-interactive context. In addition to gaining insights into the clinical efficacy of\noxytocin treatment, another major sub-aim of the current trial will be to obtain a qualitative\nevaluation of the expectations and perceptions of oxytocin treatment by conducting semi-\nstructured interviews with the participating children and parents. Thus far, only little is known\nabout the expectations and perceptions of oxytocin treatment in people with ASD. The nature of\nthe neuropeptide and how it is presented on the internet (i.e., as â€˜love hormoneâ€™ or\nâ€˜cuddling hormoneâ€™) lead to various expectations of its effects. Information and discussions\nabout oxytocin are currently found on ASD advocacy websites. As the expectations and\nperceptions of a biological intervention may have a huge influence on how the person and his/her\nenvironment evaluate the effects of intervention, it is recommended that deeper insights are\ngained into these issues.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
