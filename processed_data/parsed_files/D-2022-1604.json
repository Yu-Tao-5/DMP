Are the initial beliefs and predispositions on\nengineering the same for men/women and students with/without a migration background? 2.\nDoes the answer to the previous question helps to understand why some groups experience a\nlimited fit and lower feeling and belonging? \n3. Are the items and cases in the PREFER 1.0-tests\ngender and culturally neutral and valid? 4. Are there differences in professional role preferences\nbetween students whether or not they belong to one of the two target groups? 5. Can we\nbroaden the stereotypical initial beliefs by redesigning brochures and information days, in order\nto improve recruitment in general and more specifically the attractiveness for female students?\n6. Can we address studentsâ€™ feeling of belonging by stimulating reflection with the help of the\nPREFER 1.1- tests, in order to improve retention of students in general and more specifically the\nretention of students with a migration background? \nThese research objectives will result in two\nnew projects: a Horizon Europe project focusing on an inclusive society and a collaboration with\nindustry to implement the optimised PREFER-tests in HR-applications. \nA mixed methodology will\nbe applied to collect the data: 1. Quantitative research based on an existing validated survey and\nthe PREFER tests. 2. Qualitative research based on semi-structured interviews with students from\nboth target groups and a narrative study in which final-year pupils with a migration background\nare followed from their choice to start an engineering program at KU Leuven through their first\nyear in the engineering program. \n3. Design-based research to optimize the tests and to develop\nand implement the interventions.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. General Information\nName of the project lead (PI)\nGreet Langie\nInternal Funds Project number & title\nC3/21/056 - URGENT - UnderRepresented Groups of ENgineering sTudents: Role of professional\nawareness in inclusion\n2. Data description\n2.1. Will you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nReuse existing data\n2.2. What data will you collect, generate or reuse? Describe the origin, type and\nformat of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a\nnumbered list or table and per objective of the project.\nPart of our research will reuse data generated by the completed European project PREFER,\nbrought together within the PhD-thesis of the postdoc who is part of this project team.\nAdditionally, we will collect different types of new data:\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 5\nType of\ndata\nKind of\ndata\nFormat\nVolume\nHow\ncreated?\nQualitative\ndata\nmultimedia\nand textual\nAudio-\nrecorded\nand\ntranscribed\ninto MS\nWord\nformat and\nNvivo.\n?\ninterviews\nand\nfocusgroup\ndiscussions\nQualitative\ndata\ntextual\nWord\n?\nnarrative\nstudy\nQuantitative\ndata\nnumeric\nand textual\nExcel, SPSS\nand R\n?\nvalidated\nsurvey\nQuantitative\ndata\nnumeric\nand textual\nExcel, SPSS\nand R\n?\nPREFER tests\nQuantitative\ndata\nnumeric\nand textual\nExcel, SPSS\nand R\n?\nbackground\ninformation of\nthe students\n(academic\nachievement,\nsecondary\neducation\ninformation,\nsocio-\neconomic\nstatus, ..)\ncollected\nthrough KU\nLeuven SAP\n3. Ethical and legal issues\n3.1. Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you\nwill use. Add the reference to the file in KU Leuven's Record of Processing Activities.\nBe aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nYes, we will use personal data.\nOur study is inclusive, but we are specifically interested in how the values and beliefs of \nfemale\nstudents\n and\n students with an imigration background \ndiffer from the other first-year\nengineering students.\nWe will collect the following existing and new information: programme at university, study track\nduring secondary education, academic achievement, GPA secondary education, LASSI-results,\nsocio-economic status, etc. \n3.2. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s).\nWe will submit ethical approval to SMEC since our research is performed on human subjects, but\nis not related to health science practices or does not include medical or pharmacological\nprocedures.\n3.3. Does your research possibly result in research data with potential for tech\ntransfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If\nso, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted?\nOur research project is a C3 project. By consequence valorisation is essential.\nIP restrictions will be discussed with LRD.\n3.4. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the\ndata you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions regarding\nreuse and sharing are in place?\nThere are no existing 3rd party agreements yet.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 5\n4. Documentation and metadata\n4.1. What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of the\ndata collected/generated in this project?\nWe will provide documentation in the following way:\n1. Qualitative data (interviews and focusgroup discussions): each original and transcribed audio-\nrecorded file will be accompanied by a standardized overview sheet containing the following\nelements: date, setting, participants, informed consent, implemented guidelines,  etc..\n2. Qualitative data (narrative study): the Word document with the narratives of a student will be\naccompanied by a standardized overview sheet containing the following elements: name\nstudent, duration, setting, informed consent, guidelines, etc.\n3. Quantitative data (validated survey): a codebook will accompany the collected survey data,\ncontaining the date the survey was organized, the population, the setting, variable information,\netc.\n4. Quantitative data (PREFER tests): a codebook will accompany the collected  data, containing\nthe date the test was organized, the population, the setting, variable information, etc.\nThis documentation will be kept in the same folder as the data. The name of the folder will\ncontain the name of the method and the date.\nWe will anonimise our data where possible, pseudonomise where necessary for longitudinal\nfollow up and work with the non-anonimised data if pseudonomised data is really insurmountable\nin the long run. The file with the participants ID's in the case of pseudonomised data will be in the\nappropriate folder.\n4.2. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be\nused. If not, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nIt's our goal to use a project-specific metadata standard to guarantee a feasible, efficient and\neffective DMP. This metadata standard will be based on DDI and it will be determined by mutual\nagreement within the project group before the first data are collected.\n5. Data storage and backup during the project\n5.1. Where will the data be stored?\nSince we will be working with sensitive personal data that will be pseudonymized (or anonymized\nwhere possible), the data will be stored at the university's secure environment for private data:\nthe j-disk of KU Leuven. A working copy for analyses will be stored at the KU Leuven Teams of the\nresearch group FIIW-ETHER that is only accessible for the researchers of the project. A private\nchannel for URGENT, only accessible for the researchers of this project will store the datafiles.\n5.2. How will the data be backed up?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic daily back-up\nprocedures\n5.3. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nWe do not expect problems with storage capacity.\n5.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nWe do not expect costs for data storage and backup during the project.\n5.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not\naccessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nThe j-disk on the university's central servers is a secure environment. Also 'Teams' is a KU\nLeuven environment with restricted accessibility.\n6. Data preservation after the end of the project\n6.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the\nproject? If only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is\nthe case (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the project.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 5\n6.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central server (j-disk) for at least 10 years, conform\nthe KU Leuven RDM policy. Automatic back-up procedures are present.\n6.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How\nwill the costs be covered?\nThere are no expected costs.\n7. Data sharing and re-use\n7.1. Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data\n(e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions or because of IP\npotential)?\nAt this moment there are no agreements yet with 3rd parties in the context of the future IP.\nHowever this will be necessary in the final phase of the project once we will start collecting data\noutside KU Leuven. This will be an important point of focus during the valorization phase of the\nproject.\n7.2. Which data will be made available after the end of the project?\nAll collected data will remain available for future reuse after the end of the project for the\nmembers of the research unit. \nFuture reuse by the broader scientific community is only possible after anonymisation of the data\nsince we will be working with sensitive personal data. \n \n7.3. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nUpon request by mail\nData will be available on request after signing a data sharing agreement. \n7.4. When will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nSince the analysis of the collected data will result in a PhD thesis, the data will only become\navailable after the publication of the PhD thesis. \n7.5. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nThe anonymised data can be obtained upon request. This request should contain the planned\nreuse. At this moment, we prefer to limit this reuse to research purposes.\nHowever, once the valorization of the PREFER tests is realized and the necessary IP is arranged in\ncollaboraion with LRD, commercial reuse will be possible. At that moment, we have to reconsider\nthis DMP. \n7.6. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nThere are no costs at this moment.\n8. Responsibilities\n8.1. Who will be responsible for the data documentation & metadata?\nThe final responsible is the project promotor.\nThe PhD student and postdoc will continuously collect data, copy it on the Teams' research unit\n'FIIW - ETHER' and add the necessary metadata based on the 'standardized overview sheet' and\nthe 'codebook'. \nThe format of the standardized overview sheet and the codebook will be discussed and finalized\nin full agreement with all members of the project team.\n \n8.2. Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nThe final responsible is the project promotor.\nAt the moment a publication of some research results is accepted, the PhD student and postdoc\nwill copy the considered data for the long term on the j-disk.
