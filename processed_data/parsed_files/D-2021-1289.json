The FWO expec ts a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official  start date  of the project or fellowsh ip. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO \nbut to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the projec t; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal.

Data description  \n \nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make \nuse of existing data?  ☒ Generate new data  \n☐ Reuse existing data  \n  2 \n Describe the origin, type and format of the data \n(per dataset) and its (estimated) volume  \n \nIf you reuse  existing data, specify the source  of these \ndata.  \nDistinguish data types  (the kind of content) from \ndata formats  (the technical format).  Several types of digital data will be included in this project . These are quantitative and qualitative,  \nmainly of prim ary origin and of various types: experimental (recordings and sensors), simulated  \n(modeling), derived (data analyzing), and observational (observation and survey). Reference data  \nsets (public depositories) will also be used. Following data formats are cons idered: textual (surveys  \nand publications), numerical (measures, recording), multimedia (sensors and camera), and software  \n(Python, C++, LabView, Matlab).  \nRegarding the recording movies, we will ensure that no persons or animals are present or identifiable  in \nthe video.  \n \n3.

Data storage & backup during the FWO project  \n \nWhere will the data be stored?  All research data will be stored  in storage facilities of the research unit and will be kept for minimally 5  \nyears post finalization of the  project.  \nHow will the data be backed up?  One Drive (managed by the KU Leuven IT department)  \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely.
