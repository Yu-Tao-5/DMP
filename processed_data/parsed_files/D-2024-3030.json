Prime examples of sparse graphs include planar graphs,\ngraphs excluding a fixed minor, and graphs with bounded degrees. It is well known that sparse graphs must contain large independent sets, of size\nlinear in n. But how large an independent set are we guaranteed to find exactly? In this project, we set out to answer this question for an important\nfamily of sparse graphs, namely graphs having bounded maximum degree and no short cycles.\nMore precisely, given an upper bound on the maximum degree of a vertex, and a lower bound on the length of cycles, we are interested in determining\nthe largest real r such that every graph satisfying the bounds has an independent set consisting of at least a fraction r of its vertices. This is a\nfundamental extremal problem that has been studied for the past 40 years. While several lower and upper bounds have been established for a wide\nrange of the parameters, a precise answer is known only for a handful of cases. Based on recent developments in the area, including in a joint work of\nthe two PIs, we believe that the time is ripe to make significant progress on the problems. Our approach to tackle these problems is to develop new\nmathematical ideas and proofs with the help of computers. The computational methods envisioned include classical exhaustive generation and a novel\nmethod based on deep reinforcement learning.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n26-01-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
