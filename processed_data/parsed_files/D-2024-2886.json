The\nreceptor is most notorious as one of two co-receptors for HIV entry, but its pathogenic role extends to several other diseases as well, including graft-\nversus-host disease, cancer metastasis and other immune diseases. In these pathologies, the intracellular signalling following activation of the receptor\ntriggers pathology-associated chemotaxis, which can be prevented by pharmaceutical receptor blockade. The only FDA-approved CCR5 inhibitor\nmaraviroc binds to an extracellular site and exhibits far from ideal pharmacokinetic properties. Overall, the design of these antagonists has historically\nbeen limited by metabolic instability, CYP and hERG inhibition and poor bioavailability. In recent years an intracellular pocket has emerged as an\nalternative druggable site. As these compounds consist of radically different chemotypes compared to traditional extracellular ligands, they represent an\nattractive pathway toward the development of signalling inhibitors with a different, likely more favorable, PK profile. In the current project, we\ndescribe our strategy to enable hit discovery, hit-to-lead and lead development of CCR5 signalling inhibitors with an unprecedented mode of action.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n29-06-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
