Loss of\nneurons in the frontal and temporal lobes in FTD gives rise to behavioural changes and language\ndisturbances. Loss of neurons of the motor system in ALS causes progressive muscle weakness\nand wasting. Due to the progressive nature of FTD and ALS it has devastating effect on patients\nand their families. Although the disease presentation of FTD and ALS is very different, there is\nsubstantial overlap in the disease mechanisms leading to neuronal loss. A key feature in about\n50% of FTD and in more than 95% of ALS is the aggregation in of a protein called TDP- 43. How\naggregation of this protein is brougth about and how it causes neuronal death is not known. Such\nTDP-43 aggregation is also present in two hereditary forms of FTD and ALS, caused by mutations\nin the progranulin gene and in the C9orf72 gene, allowing us to study the mechanisms leading to\nTDP-43 aggregation in stem cell models derived from patients suffering from the disease. We\nrecently observed that the lysosomes look abnormal and dysfunctional in neurons made from\nsuch patient-derived stem cells. Lysosomes play an important role in the removal of insoluble\nproteins such as TDP-43. Therefore, a better understanding of how the lysosomal problems can\ncontribute to the aggregation of TDP-43 will be crucial to devolop treatments for these disorders.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

VIB has a policy to actively monitor research data for\nsuch potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly\nassessed, and in a number of cases the invention will be IP protected (mostly patent\nprotection or copyright protection). As such the IP protection does not withhold the\nresearch data from being made public. In the case a decision is taken to file a patent\napplication it will be planned so that publications need not be delayed.\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nYes\nYes, resource sharing with external partners was always accompanied by the generation of a\nmaterial transfer agreement (MTA) between the labs and clearly mentions the restrains.\nTo my knowledge, the only restraint concerns the isogenic iPSC lines that may not be used for\ndrug screening applications.\n4.

This file will be located in the top-level directory of the dataset and will also list\nthe contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used (see section 7 below).\nThis will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual\nvalue to the dataset for future reuse.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nDigital files will be stored on KU Leuven servers, with hourly on-site backup and mirroring or\nstored on a cloud-based service offered by KU Leuven (OneDrive). except for private data that\nwill be stored on KU Leuven secure server (digital vault).\n- Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory.\n- Omics data: omics data generated during the project will either be stored on KU Leuven servers\nor on The Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC), initially in the staging area and later in the\narchive area.\n- Cell lines: Human cell lines will be stored locally in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the\nlaboratory when actively used for experiments. Animal cell lines will be stored in liquid\nnitrogen cryostorage in the laboratory.\n- Biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as\nfrozen samples in cryovials as appropriate.\n- Algorithms, scripts, and software: All the relevant algorithms, scripts, and software\ncode driving the project will be stored in a private online git repository from the GitHub\naccount of the department (https://github.com/vibcbd).\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nKU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme:\n- data stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all\nincremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are\nkept.\n- data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight), and weekly (at\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n6 of 9\nmidnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case, the last 6 backups are kept.\n- data stored on the digital vault is backed up using snapshot technology, where all incremental\nchanges in respect of the previous version are kept online. As standard, 10% of the requested\nstorage is reserved for backups using the following backup regime: an hourly backup (at 8 a.m.,\n12 p.m., 4 p.m., and 8 p.m.), the last 6 of which are kept; a daily backup (every day) at midnight,\nthe last 6 of which are kept; and a weekly backup (every week) at midnight between Saturday\nand Sunday, the last 2 of which are kept. Regarding the cell lines and plasmids, a backup vial is\nalways stored at another location (ON4 instead of ON5)\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nData storage is arranged at a departmental level and can be increased if needed.\nThere is sufficient storage and backup capacity on all KU Leuven servers:\n- The “L-drive” is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System\n(GPFS) cluster with NetApp series storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in\nthe front-end.\n- The “J-drive” is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controllers with an Ontap\n9.1P9 operating system.\n- Onedrive provides 2TB of storage data which should be sufficient for (most of) the data\ngenerated in the project.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\n(The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 173,78€/TB/Year for the “L-drive” and\n519EUR/TB/Year for the “J-drive”.)\n \nThe housing of mice typically costs 1 €/day per cage. The mouse colony will require at least 50\ncages for 2 years (18500/year). By adding the costs of genotyping, phenotyping, and standard\nlaboratory techniques on brain samples from these mice we will need 22500€/year to execute\nthese experiments.\n \nThese costs will be covered by the FWO grant.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nThe “L-drive” and “J-drive” servers are accessible only by laboratory members and are mirrored\nin the second ICTS data center for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the\ndata can be recovered within an hour.\nAccess to the digital vault is possible only through using a KU Leuven user-id and password, and\nuser rights only grant access to the data in their own vault. Sensitive data transfer will be\nperformed according to the best practices for “Copying data to the secure environment” defined\nby KU Leuven.\nThe operating system of the vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of\nupgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS\npersonnel (bound by the ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. A security\nservice monitors the technical installations continuously, even outside working hours.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nThe minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all\ndatasets.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic backup procedures) for\nat least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n7 of 9\nFor all datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows:\nDigital datasets: files will be stored on the “L-drive”.\nBiological samples (protein, RNA, cDNA, etc.) will be stored locally in the laboratory.\nTissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory.\nOmics data: datasets will be stored on the “L-drive”.\nOther biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or frozen samples in cryovials as\nappropriate.\n \nIf appropriate, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms\nthat support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of publication.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nThe costs of digital data storage are 3000€ (based on the costs in section 5). These costs are\ncovered by the lab and or the FWO grant.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nNo\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nParticipants to the present project are committed to publish research results to communicate\nthem to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made\nopenly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to\npublication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new\ncollaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g.negative data).\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn an Open Access repository\nUpon request by mail\nWhen will the data be made available?\nImmediately after the end of the project\nAfter an embargo period. Specify the length of the embargo and why this is necessary\nUpon publication of the research results\nAs a general rule all research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at the time of\npublication. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, potential\nIP requirements – note that patent application filing will be planned so that publications need not\nbe delayed - or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be\nmade publicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached.\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nWhenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available\nthrough repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain\nsufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse and will be conform to community\nnorms. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative\nCommons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication or an ODC Public Domain\nDedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties\nwill thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the\ndata used by citing the corresponding DOI. For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer\nagreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the\nbeneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nIt is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g.\nfor metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by\nusing free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data\nmanagement costs will be covered by the laboratory budget.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n8 of 9\n8. Responsibilities\nWho will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?\nMetadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection\nand analysis, by taking careful notes in the laboratory notebook that refer to specific datasets,\nand additionally compiling applicable metadata along with the data in the manner described\nabove.\nWho will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nThe researcher and technical staff will ensure data storage and back up, with support from René\nCusters and Alexander Botzki for the electronic laboratory notebook and from Raf De Coster for\nthe KU Leuven drives.\nWho will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ?\nThe PI (Philip van Damme) is responsible for data preservation and sharing, with support from the\nresearch and technical staff involved in the project, from René Custers and Alexander Botzki for\nthe electronic laboratory notebook and from Raf De Coster for the KU Leuven drives.\nWho bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nThe PI bears the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n9 of 9"

As such the IP protection does not withhold the research data from being made public. In the case a decision is taken to file a patent application it will be planned so that publications need not be delayed. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place? Yes Yes, resource sharing with external partners was always accompanied by the generation of a material transfer agreement (MTA) between the labs and clearly mentions the restrains. To my knowledge, the only restraint concerns the isogenic iPSC lines that may not be used for drug screening applications. 4.

The final dataset will be accompanied by this information in the form of a README.txt or MS Word document. This file will be located in the top-level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used (see section 7 below). This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse. 5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project Where will the data be stored? Digital files will be stored on KU Leuven servers, with hourly on-site backup and mirroring or stored on a cloud-based service offered by KU Leuven (OneDrive). except for private data that will be stored on KU Leuven secure server (digital vault). - Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory. - Omics data: omics data generated during the project will either be stored on KU Leuven servers or on The Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC), initially in the staging area and later in the archive area. - Cell lines: Human cell lines will be stored locally in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory when actively used for experiments. Animal cell lines will be stored in liquid nitrogen cryostorage in the laboratory. - Biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate. - Algorithms, scripts, and software: All the relevant algorithms, scripts, and software code driving the project will be stored in a private online git repository from the GitHub account of the department (https://github.com/vibcbd). How is backup of the data provided? KU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme: - data stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept. - data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight), and weekly (at This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 6 of 9 midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case, the last 6 backups are kept. - data stored on the digital vault is backed up using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. As standard, 10% of the requested storage is reserved for backups using the following backup regime: an hourly backup (at 8 a.m., 12 p.m., 4 p.m., and 8 p.m.), the last 6 of which are kept; a daily backup (every day) at midnight, the last 6 of which are kept; and a weekly backup (every week) at midnight between Saturday and Sunday, the last 2 of which are kept. Regarding the cell lines and plasmids, a backup vial is always stored at another location (ON4 instead of ON5) Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Data storage is arranged at a departmental level and can be increased if needed. There is sufficient storage and backup capacity on all KU Leuven servers: - The “L-drive” is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster with NetApp series storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front-end. - The “J-drive” is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controllers with an Ontap 9.1P9 operating system. - Onedrive provides 2TB of storage data which should be sufficient for (most of) the data generated in the project. What are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these costs be covered? (The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 173,78€/TB/Year for the “L-drive” and 519EUR/TB/Year for the “J-drive”.) The housing of mice typically costs 1 €/day per cage. The mouse colony will require at least 50 cages for 2 years (18500/year). By adding the costs of genotyping, phenotyping, and standard laboratory techniques on brain samples from these mice we will need 22500€/year to execute these experiments. These costs will be covered by the FWO grant. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The “L-drive” and “J-drive” servers are accessible only by laboratory members and are mirrored in the second ICTS data center for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. Access to the digital vault is possible only through using a KU Leuven user-id and password, and user rights only grant access to the data in their own vault. Sensitive data transfer will be performed according to the best practices for “Copying data to the secure environment” defined by KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of upgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound by the ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. A security service monitors the technical installations continuously, even outside working hours. 6. Data preservation after the FWO project Which data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...). The minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets. Where will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)? The data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic backup procedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 7 of 9 For all datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows: Digital datasets: files will be stored on the “L-drive”. Biological samples (protein, RNA, cDNA, etc.) will be stored locally in the laboratory. Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory. Omics data: datasets will be stored on the “L-drive”. Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate. If appropriate, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of publication. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered? The costs of digital data storage are 3000€ (based on the costs in section 5). These costs are covered by the lab and or the FWO grant. 7. Data sharing and reuse Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? No Which data will be made available after the end of the project? Participants to the present project are committed to publish research results to communicate them to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made openly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new collaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g.negative data). Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? In an Open Access repository Upon request by mail When will the data be made available? Immediately after the end of the project After an embargo period. Specify the length of the embargo and why this is necessary Upon publication of the research results As a general rule all research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at the time of publication. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, potential IP requirements – note that patent application filing will be planned so that publications need not be delayed - or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be made publicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse and will be conform to community norms. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication or an ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered? It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 8 of 9 8.
