The plan ensures compliance  \nwith the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles and \naddresses the data lifecycle, from collection and storage to dissemination and \nlong-term preservation. It supports the project’s goal of facilitating industry and \npolicy efforts in reducing the climate impact of the building sector, while \nconcurrently aiding in the development of national Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) \nmethodologies, benchmarks, and policy recommendations.\nThis deliverable (D.1.4) details the types of data collected, their sources, and how \nthey will be used to meet project objectives. It emphasizes the application of FAIR  \nprinciples by describing provisions for metadata, open accessibility, \ninteroperability across platforms, and strategies for ensuring long-term data \nreusability. Additionally, it explains how data will be stored, secured, and shared \nwhile adhering to GDPR and ethical standards.\nKey sections cover resource allocation for data management, data security \nprotocols, and ethical considerations to safeguard sensitive information. Plans for \nlong-term preservation include the use of trusted repositories to maintain data \nintegrity and accessibility. Specific datasets and their utility to researchers, \npolicymakers, and industry stakeholders are also outlined, highlighting the data’s \nbroader relevance.\nBy establishing robust protocols for data handling and FAIR compliance, the DMP  \nenhances transparency, collaboration, and the project's overall impact on the \nimplementation of the WLC aspects of the EPBD in terms of benchmark and \ntarget development and the definition of decarbonization pathways and \nsustainable design strategies.\n5\nThis project is co-funded by the European Union’s Life programme under grant agreement

101167585.1.Introduction  \nThe purpose of this first Data Management Plan (DMP) is to provide an analysis of  \nthe main elements of the project’s data management policy.\nThe DMP is a living document that describes the data management starting from  \nits collection, including its processing and handling during the INDICATE LIFE \nproject and, finally, its later archiving and dissemination.\nThe document helps project partners to determine how the data can be \nmanaged efficiently and effectively and reduce the risk of data loss and conflicts. \nEthical issues and data security are also briefly discussed within the document. \nFinally, the plan ensures consistent resource and budgetary planning for data \nmanagement related costs.\nThe plan lists and briefly describes the types and specifications of data that is and \nwill be collected, generated, processed or generally, used, during the project. The \nDMP also includes details on how the research data will be handled both during \nthe project and afterwards.\nThe DMP aligns with the principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, \nand Reusable), as advocated by Horizon Europe guidelines. It addresses all stages \nof the data lifecycle, from generation and organization to long-term preservation \nand potential reuse. This document also ensures adherence to the highest \nstandards of data quality, security, and ethical responsibility, safeguarding \nsensitive information and respecting privacy regulations.\nThe DMP will evolve during the lifespan of the project, particularly whenever \nsignificant changes arise within the management of the consortium and the \ngeneration of datasets.\nUpcoming versions of the DMP may get into more detail on particular issues such  \nas the possible use of data generated by third parties.\nThis report follows to the template1 provided by the European Commission and \nwill be updated periodically throughout the project's duration. Section 2 provides \ninformation on the project ,. Section 3 summarizes the collected data, while \nSection 4 emphasizes the application of FAIR principles. Resource allocation is \noutlined in Section 5, and data security is discussed in Section 6. Ethical \nconsiderations are explored in Section 7, followed by a description of the Risk \nManagement in Section 8.\n1 https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/\nhorizon/temp-form/report/data-management-plan_he_en.docx\n \n9\nThis project is co-funded by the European Union’s Life programme under grant agreement 101167585.2.Project background\nINDICATE LIFE is a 26-month project which launched in October 2024 and is co-\nfunded by the European Union’s LIFE programme. The project is coordinated by \nSmith Innovation and supported by project partners: Building Performance \nInstitute Europe (BPIE), Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven), and \nWorldGBC.\nBuilding on the successes of the original INDICATE project, which implemented \npilots in Ireland, Spain, and the Czech Republic, INDICATE LIFE seeks to address \ngaps in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) data for Whole-Life Carbon (WLC) \nregulations in Austria, Croatia, Italy, Luxembourg, and Hungary.\n3.Data summary\nData collection and generation has an important role in the INDICATE LIFE \nproject. As data will be collected throughout the duration of the project and \nwithin different tasks that are a part of specific working packages, Table 1 \nprovides an overview of all project datasets expected to be collected during the \nduration of the project.  As the project moves forward, the chapters and tables \nwill be updated with new information.\nTable 1: Project datasets\nProject data Institution in charge WP\nINDICATE_1_Project_Partner\nThis dataset consists of consortium members \nand their contacts.SMITH 1\nINDICATE_2_Advisory_Board\nThis dataset consists of Advisory Board \nMembers and their contacts.SMITH 1\nINDICATE_3_WLC_indicate_life_allcountries\nThis dataset consists of categorized data on \nWLC of representative building cases per pilot \ncountryKU Leuven 2\nINDICATE_4_WLC_indicate_life_Austria\nThis dataset consists of categorized data on \nWLC of representative building cases for \nAustriaTU Graz 7\nINDICATE_5_WLC_indicate_life_Luxembourg\nThis dataset consists of categorized data on \nWLC of representative building cases for \nLuxembourgE&E 7\n10\nThis project is co-funded by the European Union’s Life programme under grant agreement 101167585.Project data Institution in charge WP\nINDICATE_6_WLC_indicate_life_Croatia\nThis dataset consists of categorized data on \nWLC of representative building cases for \nCroatiaUZ-FCE 7\nINDICATE_7_WLC_indicate_life_Italy\nThis dataset consists of categorized data on \nWLC of representative building cases for ItalyPolimi 7\n3.1Purpose of Data Generation or Re-Use  \nThe purpose of data generation or reuse is to support the project's objectives by \nproviding the necessary information for analysis, validation, and decision-making. \nGenerated data ensures that project-specific insights are captured, while reused \ndata leverages existing knowledge and resources to enhance efficiency and build  \non prior work. Together, these approaches enable the project to achieve its goals \nmore effectively, aligning all data-related activities with the overarching \nobjectives. Table 2 provides an overview of the datasets and their contribution to \nthe project’s objectives.\nTable 2: Overview of dataset generation or re-use\nProject dataset Generation or Re-Use of  \nExisting Data\nINDICATE_1_Project_Partner Generated\nINDICATE_2_Advisory_Board Generated\nINDICATE_3_WLC_indicate_life_allcountries Generated and re-used\nINDICATE_4_WLC_indicate_life_Austria Generated and re-used\nINDICATE_5_WLC_indicate_life_Luxembourg Generated and re-used\nINDICATE_6_WLC_indicate_life_Croatia Generated and re-used\nINDICATE_7_WLC_indicate_life_Italy Generated and re-used\n3.2Types and Formats of Data\nThis chapter outlines the types and formats of data the project will generate or re-\nuse. It provides a detailed overview of how the data will be structured, managed, \nand utilized to support the project’s objectives efficiently. For example, the \n11\nThis project is co-funded by the European Union’s Life programme under grant agreement 101167585.project may generate quantitative data in CSV or Excel formats,  and qualitative \ndata from interviews stored as text files or PDFs,. Additionally, reused datasets \nmay include publicly available statistics in XML or JSON formats or legacy project \ndata archived in institutional repositories.

The goal of a PID is to \nensure that a resource can be reliably located and cited, even after many years.\nPIDs are commonly used in digital contexts, such as academic publishing, data \nrepositories, or libraries, where they help linking to research papers, datasets, or \nother content. Examples of PIDs include:\n-DOI (Digital Object Identifier):  Used for academic papers, books, and  \ndatasets to provide a permanent link.\n-ORCiD: A  PID  for  researchers  that  ensures  their  work  is  correctly  \nattributed to them.\n-ROR  (Research  Organization  Registry):  A  PID  for  research  \norganizations,  ensuring  consistent  identification  and  linking  across  \nacademic and institutional records2.\nIn our project, the data generated and re-used will be organized to guarantee \ndiscoverability and traceability, leveraging standardized identification methods \nsuch as PIDs. The naming convention for project datasets will be structured as \noutlined in Table 7.\nTable 7: Naming Conventions of Datasets\nType of Data Naming \nConventionExamples\nDeliverable INDICATELIFE_D[n\number of INDICATELIFE_D1.4\n_Data \n2 https://www.nnlm.gov/guides/data-glossary/persistent-unique-identifier  \n14\nThis project is co-funded by the European Union’s Life programme under grant agreement 101167585.Type of Data Naming \nConventionExamples\ndeliverable]_[descri\nption of \ndeliverable]_[versio\nn].[format]management \nplan_v1.pdf\nPhotographs and audio/visual \nrecordingsINDICATELIFE_[eve\nnt][date of event]\n[description of \nevent/content]INDICATE_DesignS\nprintCroatia_2025_\nGroupPicture.jpg\nDatasets INDICATELIFE_[dat\naset \nname]_[partner \ninitials]_ \nv[n°version.[format]INDICATELIFE_WL\nCItaly \n_PoLiMi_v2csv\nOther Documents INDICATELIFE_[doc\nument type] \n_[Work \npackage]_[partner \ninitials]_[version].\n[format]INDICATELIFE_Dat\na management \nplan_WP1_KUL_v1.d\nocx\nDocument filenames are kept concise to prevent excessively long paths and \nconsistently include the last partner who edited the document along with a \nversion identifier. All project documentation is stored in a SharePoint folder \nmanaged by SMITH Innovation dedicated to the relevant work package, \nproviding complete control over editing permissions for project participants.  \n4.1.2Metadata\nThe goal is to provide rich metadata to support the discovery and reuse of \ndatasets, but the extent to which metadata can be created and the standards \nfollowed will depend on the nature of each dataset.  \nWe promote data discoverability by encouraging the use of metadata standards3 \nand offering detailed information tailored to data related to engineering, social \nand behavioural sciences, research applications, and more. A list of key elements \nof metadata description are provided in .\n4.1.3Search Keywords\nFor datasets to be easily discoverable, we aim to incorporate search keywords \nthat are relevant to the dataset’s content. Partners should provide keywords or \nterms that best describe their dataset’s subject and scope.  \n3 https://rdamsc.bath.ac.uk/  \n15\nThis project is co-funded by the European Union’s Life programme under grant agreement 101167585.4.1.4Harvesting and Indexing Metadata\nData harvesting and indexing refer to the processes that enable datasets and \ntheir associated metadata to be automatically collected and organized for easier \ndiscovery. Harvesting involves gathering metadata from datasets, typically using \nstandardized protocols like OAI-PMH (Open Archives Initiative Protocol for \nMetadata Harvesting)4, which allows external systems, such as data repositories \nor search engines, to collect this information. Once harvested, the metadata is \nindexed, meaning it is stored in a searchable database, making it easier for users \nto find and access the datasets. These processes ensure that data can be \ndiscovered and reused by a wider audience.\n4.2Making Data Openly Accessible\n4.2.1Repository\nAt this stage of the project, the specifics regarding data deposition in a trusted \nrepository are yet to be determined. As data is collected and processed \nthroughout the project, we will identify and explore appropriate repositories that \nalign with the requirements of our datasets and ensure their long-term \npreservation and discoverability. Additionally, we will evaluate whether the \nselected repositories assign persistent identifiers (e.g., DOIs) to datasets and \nensure these identifiers resolve to the corresponding digital objects. These \nconsiderations will be addressed in collaboration with project partners and \nstakeholders as part of our ongoing data management planning.\n4.2.2Data\nThe only data that will not be made openly accessible are those containing \npersonally identifiable information (e.g., individual evaluation forms) and data \nrelated to deliverables that are covered by confidentiality agreements. Personal \ndata processed in the project will remain closed and inaccessible to third parties.\n4.2.3Metadata\nAt this stage of the project, the specifics regarding metadata availability, \nlicensing, and documentation are still being defined. As the project progresses, \nwe will determine whether metadata will be made openly available and licensed \nunder a public domain dedication (CC0)  as required by the Grant Agreement . If \nthis is not possible, we will provide clear justification for the decision. Additionally, \nwe will ensure that metadata includes sufficient information to enable users to \naccess the data and understand its context.\nThe duration for which the data remains available and discoverable will be \noutlined as we finalize our data management plan. We will also ensure that \nmetadata will remain accessible even if the data itself becomes unavailable.\nAs for documentation and software requirements, we will evaluate whether any \nsoftware is necessary for accessing or reading the data and will include \nappropriate documentation for this purpose. If applicable, we will explore the \npossibility of making the relevant software available, potentially as open-source \n4 https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/  \n16\nThis project is co-funded by the European Union’s Life programme under grant agreement 101167585.code, to facilitate data access and reuse. These details will be addressed in later \nstages of the project as data collection and processing progresses.\n4.3Making Data Interoperable\nTo ensure data interoperability and facilitate data exchange and reuse across \ndisciplines, we will follow widely accepted data and metadata standards, formats, \nand methodologies relevant to our project. Where possible, we will adhere to \ncommunity-endorsed interoperability best practices to enhance the \ndiscoverability and reusability of our data.  \nWe also intend to include qualified references to other relevant datasets, whether  \nfrom our own project or previous research, to create a more interconnected data \necosystem. As the project advances and data is identified and collected, \nadditional details on ensuring data interoperability will be provided in later \nversions of the DMP.\n4.4Increase Data Re-Use\nTo facilitate data analysis validation and ensure data reusability, we will provide \ncomprehensive documentation, such as readme files containing information on \nmethodology, codebooks, data cleaning processes, analyses, variable definitions, \nunits of measurement, and other relevant details. This documentation will ensure \nthat users can understand and interpret the data accurately.  \nWe intend to make the data freely available in the public domain, ensuring the \nwidest possible reuse, and will license the data deliverables under standard reuse \nlicenses, in accordance with FAIR  principles. The data produced during the \nproject will be designed for long-term usability by third parties, even after the \nconclusion of the project.  \nThe provenance of the data will be thoroughly documented, following \nappropriate standards to ensure transparency regarding its origins and any \ntransformations it undergoes. We will implement relevant data quality assurance \nprocesses to maintain the integrity and reliability of the data, ensuring that it \nmeets high standards of accuracy and consistency.\n5.Allocation of resources\nEach partner is generally responsible for arranging the proper storage of the \ninternal data they manage for the project, which includes covering the expenses \nrelated to hardware, maintenance, administration, and backups. However, all \nproject related data is safely stored on the shared SharePoint held on the servers \nof Smith Innovation. The cost of the project SharePoint is covered by Smith \nInnovation. A detailed description of allocation of resources by the partners is \nprovided in Table 8.\nTable 8: Description of allocation of resources\nConsortium Partner Brief description of allocation of resources\nSMITH INNOVATION APS Project related data will be stored on the secure  \nshared INDICATE LIFE SharePoint provided by \n17\nThis project is co-funded by the European Union’s Life programme under grant agreement 101167585.Consortium Partner Brief description of allocation of resources\nSmith.

Data security\n6.1Data usage by Consortium Members\nAll INDICATE LIFE partners implement appropriate measures to ensure data \nsecurity (e.g., measures for virus protection, data encryption, and password-\nsecured files and computers). Secure storage is crucial to ensure the security of \ndata. For this reason, the project documentation and data on project’s SharePoint  \nis restricted to individuals with access to the folder. The Project Coordinator \n(Smith Innovation) determines these permissions. The data remains confidential \nand is not disclosed to individuals outside the research team until it has been \nfinalized for publication and approved for release by the project consortium.\nAdditionally, partners using their own data storage to work on the project will \nfollow the same precautions to ensure all project data is collected, stored, \nprotected, and shared in adherence to stringent security protocols and in full \ncompliance with applicable EU legislation.\n6.2Long term Preservation and Curation  \nIf any data generated or reused as part of the datasets listed in Chapter 3 requires \nlong-term preservation, it will be stored in secure and trusted repositories that \nadhere to international standards for long-term preservation and curation. To \nensure the secure management and future usability of project data, these \nrepositories must provide:\n20\nThis project is co-funded by the European Union’s Life programme under grant agreement 101167585.-Data  Integrity:  Reliable  mechanisms  to  safeguard  against  data  \ncorruption or loss over time.\n-Accessibility: Persistent identifiers (e.g., DOIs) to ensure data remains  \ndiscoverable and reusable. \n-Compliance:  Full  adherence  to  FAIR  principles  (Findable,  Accessible,  \nInteroperable, Reusable) and applicable data protection regulations.  \n-Support: Comprehensive, ongoing support for data curation, including  \nmetadata updates and maintenance.\nThese measures collectively guarantee that the project's data remains secure, \naccessible, and usable for future research and applications. Throughout the \nproject duration, we will continuously monitor and assess these repositories to \nensure they meet the evolving standards and requirements for data preservation \nand accessibility.\n7.Ethical aspects\nThere are no ethical aspects related to sharing or long-term preservation of the \ndata generated/collected in the project.\nConsent forms are crucial for maintaining ethical standards and complying with \nlegal requirements during project activities involving personal data or media. \nThey may be needed for recording or photographing organized events and for \nusing these materials in project reports, promotional content, or on social media \nplatforms such as LinkedIn and the project website. Additionally, consent is \nrequired when participants take part in surveys that collect personal data, \nensuring their rights are respected and providing transparency about how their \ninformation will be utilized .\nConsent for data sharing and long-term preservation will be included in any \nquestionnaires involving personal data. The consent process will ensure that \nparticipants are fully aware of how their data will be used, stored, and preserved. \nA preliminary version of the consent form can be found in  .\n8. Risk Management\nRisk management outlines potential challenges or uncertainties that could affect \nthe project’s data handling processes and how those risks will be mitigated. This \nchapter helps ensuring that data is managed effectively, securely, and \nresponsibly throughout the project. Potential risks, their assessment and \nmitigation strategies are provided in the table below.\nTable 9: Naming Conventions of Datasets\nDescrip\ntion of \nthe riskLikelihood Impact SeverityMitigation strategies\nData \nloss or Medium: \nPossible to Loss of \nprogress, MediumCreating regular data \nbackups, storing in \n21\nThis project is co-funded by the European Union’s Life programme under grant agreement 101167585.Descrip\ntion of \nthe riskLikelihood Impact SeverityMitigation strategies\ncorrupt\nionoccur (20-50% \nprobability).delays, reduced \ndata quality, \nincreased costs, \nloss of trust and \nstakeholder \ninconveniencedifferent locations in \ncase of hardware \nfailure, restricting \naccess to limit who \ncan access, modify, or \ndelete data.\nData \naccess \nand \nsecurit\nyMedium: \nLikely to occur \n(30-60% \nprobability).Unauthorized \naccess, data \nbreaches, loss \nof sensitive or \nconfidential \ndata, \nreputational \nharm.HighData anonymization, \nadherence to GDPR, \ninformed consent, and  \nconfidentiality \nagreements to protect \nsensitive data.\nCompli\nance \nwith \nlegal \nand \nethical \nstandar\ndsLow: Unlikely \nto occur (10-\n20% \nprobability).Fines, \nreputational \ndamage, \nproject delays, \ninability to \nshare data \nacross regions.HighData anonymization, \nconsulting legal \nexperts, ensuring \ncompliance with \nGDPR and ethics.\nData \nquality \nissuesMedium: \nPossible to \noccur (20-50% \nprobability).Inaccurate \nanalyses, \nmisinformed \ndecisions, \nreduced project \ncredibility, \nadditional \nresource costs.MediumDefining quality \ncriteria (accuracy, \ncompleteness, \ntimeliness, and \nconsistency), using \nstandardized \ntemplates, enforcing \ndata collection \nprotocols, metadata, \nquality review of the \ndeliverables.\nData \navailabi\nlityMedium: \nLikely to occur \n(30-60% \nprobability).Loss of access \nto important \ndatasets, \ninability to \nreproduce \nresearch \nresults, or \nfuture use MediumUsing trusted \nrepositories, ensuring \ndata redundancy by \nsaving in multiple \nformats, and applying \npersistent identifiers \nto ensure long-term \ndiscoverability.\n22\nThis project is co-funded by the European Union’s Life programme under grant agreement 101167585.Descrip\ntion of \nthe riskLikelihood Impact SeverityMitigation strategies\nlimitations.\nhttps://www.indicatedata.com/\n\n23\nThis project is co-funded by the European Union’s Life programme under grant agreement 101167585.Appendix 1: List of Key Metadata Information\n1.

The DMP is a living document that describes the data management starting from its collection, including its processing and handling during the INDICATE LIFE project and, finally, its later archiving and dissemination. The document helps project partners to determine how the data can be managed efficiently and effectively and reduce the risk of data loss and conflicts. Ethical issues and data security are also briefly discussed within the document. Finally, the plan ensures consistent resource and budgetary planning for data management related costs. The plan lists and briefly describes the types and specifications of data that is and will be collected, generated, processed or generally, used, during the project. The DMP also includes details on how the research data will be handled both during the project and afterwards. The DMP aligns with the principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), as advocated by Horizon Europe guidelines. It addresses all stages of the data lifecycle, from generation and organization to long-term preservation and potential reuse. This document also ensures adherence to the highest standards of data quality, security, and ethical responsibility, safeguarding sensitive information and respecting privacy regulations. The DMP will evolve during the lifespan of the project, particularly whenever significant changes arise within the management of the consortium and the generation of datasets. Upcoming versions of the DMP may get into more detail on particular issues such as the possible use of data generated by third parties. This report follows to the template1 provided by the European Commission and will be updated periodically throughout the project's duration. Section 2 provides information on the project ,. Section 3 summarizes the collected data, while Section 4 emphasizes the application of FAIR principles. Resource allocation is outlined in Section 5, and data security is discussed in Section 6. Ethical considerations are explored in Section 7, followed by a description of the Risk Management in Section 8. 1 https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/ horizon/temp-form/report/data-management-plan_he_en.docx 9 This project is co-funded by the European Union’s Life programme under grant agreement 101167585.2.Project background INDICATE LIFE is a 26-month project which launched in October 2024 and is co- funded by the European Union’s LIFE programme. The project is coordinated by Smith Innovation and supported by project partners: Building Performance Institute Europe (BPIE), Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven), and WorldGBC. Building on the successes of the original INDICATE project, which implemented pilots in Ireland, Spain, and the Czech Republic, INDICATE LIFE seeks to address gaps in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) data for Whole-Life Carbon (WLC) regulations in Austria, Croatia, Italy, Luxembourg, and Hungary. 3.Data summary Data collection and generation has an important role in the INDICATE LIFE project.

The goal of a PID is to ensure that a resource can be reliably located and cited, even after many years. PIDs are commonly used in digital contexts, such as academic publishing, data repositories, or libraries, where they help linking to research papers, datasets, or other content. Examples of PIDs include: -DOI (Digital Object Identifier): Used for academic papers, books, and datasets to provide a permanent link. -ORCiD: A PID for researchers that ensures their work is correctly attributed to them. -ROR (Research Organization Registry): A PID for research organizations, ensuring consistent identification and linking across academic and institutional records2. In our project, the data generated and re-used will be organized to guarantee discoverability and traceability, leveraging standardized identification methods such as PIDs. The naming convention for project datasets will be structured as outlined in Table 7.

All project documentation is stored in a SharePoint folder managed by SMITH Innovation dedicated to the relevant work package, providing complete control over editing permissions for project participants. 4.1.2Metadata The goal is to provide rich metadata to support the discovery and reuse of datasets, but the extent to which metadata can be created and the standards followed will depend on the nature of each dataset. We promote data discoverability by encouraging the use of metadata standards3 and offering detailed information tailored to data related to engineering, social and behavioural sciences, research applications, and more. A list of key elements of metadata description are provided in . 4.1.3Search Keywords For datasets to be easily discoverable, we aim to incorporate search keywords that are relevant to the dataset’s content. Partners should provide keywords or terms that best describe their dataset’s subject and scope. 3 https://rdamsc.bath.ac.uk/ 15 This project is co-funded by the European Union’s Life programme under grant agreement 101167585.4.1.4Harvesting and Indexing Metadata Data harvesting and indexing refer to the processes that enable datasets and their associated metadata to be automatically collected and organized for easier discovery. Harvesting involves gathering metadata from datasets, typically using standardized protocols like OAI-PMH (Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting)4, which allows external systems, such as data repositories or search engines, to collect this information. Once harvested, the metadata is indexed, meaning it is stored in a searchable database, making it easier for users to find and access the datasets. These processes ensure that data can be discovered and reused by a wider audience. 4.2Making Data Openly Accessible 4.2.1Repository At this stage of the project, the specifics regarding data deposition in a trusted repository are yet to be determined. As data is collected and processed throughout the project, we will identify and explore appropriate repositories that align with the requirements of our datasets and ensure their long-term preservation and discoverability. Additionally, we will evaluate whether the selected repositories assign persistent identifiers (e.g., DOIs) to datasets and ensure these identifiers resolve to the corresponding digital objects. These considerations will be addressed in collaboration with project partners and stakeholders as part of our ongoing data management planning. 4.2.2Data The only data that will not be made openly accessible are those containing personally identifiable information (e.g., individual evaluation forms) and data related to deliverables that are covered by confidentiality agreements. Personal data processed in the project will remain closed and inaccessible to third parties. 4.2.3Metadata At this stage of the project, the specifics regarding metadata availability, licensing, and documentation are still being defined. As the project progresses, we will determine whether metadata will be made openly available and licensed under a public domain dedication (CC0) as required by the Grant Agreement . If this is not possible, we will provide clear justification for the decision. Additionally, we will ensure that metadata includes sufficient information to enable users to access the data and understand its context. The duration for which the data remains available and discoverable will be outlined as we finalize our data management plan. We will also ensure that metadata will remain accessible even if the data itself becomes unavailable. As for documentation and software requirements, we will evaluate whether any software is necessary for accessing or reading the data and will include appropriate documentation for this purpose. If applicable, we will explore the possibility of making the relevant software available, potentially as open-source 4 https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/ 16 This project is co-funded by the European Union’s Life programme under grant agreement 101167585.code, to facilitate data access and reuse. These details will be addressed in later stages of the project as data collection and processing progresses. 4.3Making Data Interoperable To ensure data interoperability and facilitate data exchange and reuse across disciplines, we will follow widely accepted data and metadata standards, formats, and methodologies relevant to our project. Where possible, we will adhere to community-endorsed interoperability best practices to enhance the discoverability and reusability of our data. We also intend to include qualified references to other relevant datasets, whether from our own project or previous research, to create a more interconnected data ecosystem. As the project advances and data is identified and collected, additional details on ensuring data interoperability will be provided in later versions of the DMP. 4.4Increase Data Re-Use To facilitate data analysis validation and ensure data reusability, we will provide comprehensive documentation, such as readme files containing information on methodology, codebooks, data cleaning processes, analyses, variable definitions, units of measurement, and other relevant details. This documentation will ensure that users can understand and interpret the data accurately. We intend to make the data freely available in the public domain, ensuring the widest possible reuse, and will license the data deliverables under standard reuse licenses, in accordance with FAIR principles. The data produced during the project will be designed for long-term usability by third parties, even after the conclusion of the project. The provenance of the data will be thoroughly documented, following appropriate standards to ensure transparency regarding its origins and any transformations it undergoes. We will implement relevant data quality assurance processes to maintain the integrity and reliability of the data, ensuring that it meets high standards of accuracy and consistency. 5.Allocation of resources Each partner is generally responsible for arranging the proper storage of the internal data they manage for the project, which includes covering the expenses related to hardware, maintenance, administration, and backups. However, all project related data is safely stored on the shared SharePoint held on the servers of Smith Innovation. The cost of the project SharePoint is covered by Smith Innovation.

Data security 6.1Data usage by Consortium Members All INDICATE LIFE partners implement appropriate measures to ensure data security (e.g., measures for virus protection, data encryption, and password- secured files and computers). Secure storage is crucial to ensure the security of data. For this reason, the project documentation and data on project’s SharePoint is restricted to individuals with access to the folder. The Project Coordinator (Smith Innovation) determines these permissions. The data remains confidential and is not disclosed to individuals outside the research team until it has been finalized for publication and approved for release by the project consortium. Additionally, partners using their own data storage to work on the project will follow the same precautions to ensure all project data is collected, stored, protected, and shared in adherence to stringent security protocols and in full compliance with applicable EU legislation. 6.2Long term Preservation and Curation If any data generated or reused as part of the datasets listed in Chapter 3 requires long-term preservation, it will be stored in secure and trusted repositories that adhere to international standards for long-term preservation and curation. To ensure the secure management and future usability of project data, these repositories must provide: 20 This project is co-funded by the European Union’s Life programme under grant agreement 101167585.-Data Integrity: Reliable mechanisms to safeguard against data corruption or loss over time. -Accessibility: Persistent identifiers (e.g., DOIs) to ensure data remains discoverable and reusable. -Compliance: Full adherence to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and applicable data protection regulations. -Support: Comprehensive, ongoing support for data curation, including metadata updates and maintenance. These measures collectively guarantee that the project's data remains secure, accessible, and usable for future research and applications. Throughout the project duration, we will continuously monitor and assess these repositories to ensure they meet the evolving standards and requirements for data preservation and accessibility. 7.Ethical aspects There are no ethical aspects related to sharing or long-term preservation of the data generated/collected in the project. Consent forms are crucial for maintaining ethical standards and complying with legal requirements during project activities involving personal data or media. They may be needed for recording or photographing organized events and for using these materials in project reports, promotional content, or on social media platforms such as LinkedIn and the project website. Additionally, consent is required when participants take part in surveys that collect personal data, ensuring their rights are respected and providing transparency about how their information will be utilized . Consent for data sharing and long-term preservation will be included in any questionnaires involving personal data. The consent process will ensure that participants are fully aware of how their data will be used, stored, and preserved. A preliminary version of the consent form can be found in . 8. Risk Management Risk management outlines potential challenges or uncertainties that could affect the project’s data handling processes and how those risks will be mitigated.
