Electronic lab note books will be used and templates have been designed for writing\nprotocols/SOPs, for excel spreadsheets for raw data and (statistical) analysis. When raw data are uploaded on repositories, keywords\nwill be affixed along with readme files containing the needed information for reuse.

Metadata of raw images (file size, pixel\nnumber, acquisition date, settings, etc.) and qRT-PCR are captured automatically and saved on the server together with the\ncorresponding data files. Other metadata (on quantification procedures, biochemical analysis, \netc.\n) are mostly captured manually and\nlogged in lab notebooks or in searchable Excel/Access databases. For these metadata, we will progressively design own metadata\nstandards using http://dublincore.rog/. We will also consider archiving our data using general data repositories\n(https://figshare.com/ and https://zenodo.org/).

Yes Collaboration with non-KU Leuven partner (INSERM, FRANCE): agreements related to exploitation and dissemination have been written down in a collaboration agreement signed on March 22nd, 2023 by all parties involved in the project. Dissemination and exploitation of patient data to 3rd parties obtained in collaboration with Prof. M. Delcroix is restricted, and we will ensure privacy of the patients by pseudonymisation. A link between the patient and the dataset will be encoded. This code will not contain information that could lead to the identification of the patient and will be stored in an encrypted way on a different location than the pseudonymised data. The unique ‘eenmalig administratief dossiernummer’ (EAD number) in the UZ Leuven patient database will not be used. The code will only be accessible to Marion Delcroix (collaboration) and Rozenn Quarck (co-promoter), the clinical data manager of BREATHE. Human data from French PAH patients will not be sent to other participants of the project. Generated raw data from pseudonymised samples will be sent to Prof. David Montani who will depseudonymise and analyse the data. Prof. Montani, partner of the project with Dr. Frédéric Perros, is Professor of Respiratory Medicine at the French National Referral Centre for Pulmonary Hypertension in the Department of Respiratory Medicine, at the Hôpital Bicêtre, Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, Paris-Sud University, France and team leader in the INSERM U999 laboratory « Pulmonary Hypertension: Pathophysiology and Novel Therapies», Hôpital Marie Lannelongue, Le Plessis Robinson.

Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). Main results and methods will be published in peer-reviewed journals (open access as required by FWO regulations) and all publications will be archived in Lirias, the digital KU Leuven document repository. All digital data digital data generated in the project for each WP and associated metadata will be archived digitally and a searchable database format (Excel or Access) will be implemented. Electronic lab note books will be used and templates have been designed for writing protocols/SOPs, for excel spreadsheets for raw data and (statistical) analysis. When raw data are uploaded on repositories, keywords will be affixed along with readme files containing the needed information for reuse. In the final stage of the project, a master index file with the combined metadata for each WP will be generated and archived on a non-editable drive of the host institution KU Leuven (‘K drive’). All physical data physical data collected during the course of the project will be stored at designated storage places (at room temperature or frozen) and location and preservation method of the biological samples (tissues, tissue sections, genetic material,...) will be documented digitally (.xlsx files).

Yes Metadata will be a combination of machine-generated and manually generated metadata. Metadata of raw images (file size, pixel number, acquisition date, settings, etc.) and qRT-PCR are captured automatically and saved on the server together with the corresponding data files. Other metadata (on quantification procedures, biochemical analysis, etc. ) are mostly captured manually and logged in lab notebooks or in searchable Excel/Access databases. For these metadata, we will progressively design own metadata standards using http://dublincore.rog/. We will also consider archiving our data using general data repositories (https://figshare.com/ and https://zenodo.org/). RNAseq data will be uploaded to the GEO repository which uses the MIAME standard. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3.

If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Digital data Digital data : I have access to 100 Gb storage space on the KU Leuven Enterprise Box. This should be sufficient, except for large volume datasets (e.g., microscopy images, sequencing datasets). For large volume datasets, space is reserved on the editable KU Leuven network drives (J or L). Also, space is reserved on the read-only K drive for storage after the end of the project or after publication of manuscripts. Storage on the J and K KU Leuven network drives is extendable by blocks of 100 Gb), storage on the L drive is extendable per 5 Tb, hence, by acquiring additional storage space based on the project’s requirements, sufficient storage can be made available. For storage of physical data physical data , sufficient storage space is available. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Digital data. Digital data. Both UZ Leuven and KU Leuven network servers are compatible with GDPR regulations and allow for secure storage of personal data. KU Leuven ICTS services provide the option to control data access for authorized persons only (in this case, research lab members involved in this project). As mentioned above for personal data stored on the UZ Leuven central server, access will be restricted with access right management only to clinical data manager Rozenn Quarck (co-promoter) and Prof. M. Delcroix (collaborator). All physical data physical data , printed forms and notebooks are stored in the labs in locked cabinet. Access to the lab is secured and badge controlled. In case samples are stored at the Biobank, secure storage is guaranteed by controlling access to the storage location. Access to this location will be limited to one person and one back-up person per research group. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project?
