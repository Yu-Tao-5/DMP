These systems are based on\nclimate and fertigation control, but mostly do not take into account specific plant processes.

Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Data will be stored locally, in shared OneDrive folders (via KU Leuven license), and on KULeuven servers if necessary. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Digital data will be backed up weekly in KU Leuven Onedrive folders. Non-digital data are mostly sensor materials and cannot be backed up. The recipes for their production will be standardized for maximal reproducibility and saved digitally. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes For now, the expected data volume is <= 1 TB.

What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Onedrive folders are free of charge through the KU Leuven license. In case shared network folders will be used, the expected costs are starting around € 104 - 251 / TB / year, depending on the storage type (shared, large storage, ...) . This cost can be covered through my FWO benchfee if necessary. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project 4.

Experimental data and code used for publications can be stored in repositories. Physical data (e.g. sensor prototypes) will be discarded as they can be reproduced using above protocols and storage space is limited. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Digital data will be stored in repositories whenever published (e.g. the KU Leuven RDR or Zenodo).

What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Storing data in RDR is free of charge for 50 GB/year. This volume can be upgraded. Zenodo offers a free of charge storage of 50 Gb/dataset, allowing for multiple datasets to be stored. In case data are stored on the KU Leuven large volume servers a cost of € 104,42/TB/year can be expected. These costs will be covered by the lab PI. 5. Data sharing and reuse 5.
