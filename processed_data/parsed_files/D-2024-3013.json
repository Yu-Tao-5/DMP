However, the cathodic deposition of highly-connected MOF films that possess good chemical\nstability remains challenging because of the harsh conditions required for the nucleation of the MOF crystals. The main objective of this project is to\nprovide a strategy that enables the one-step cathodic deposition of highly-connected MOF films by accelerating the deprotonation of organic linkers\nand generating metal clusters in the deposition bath (which are the key to the highly-connected MOF crystal formation). Also, control of the\nmorphology of the deposited MOF films and its underlying mechanism will be explored. As a proof-of-concept of the cathodically deposited highly-\nconnected MOF film, anode-free lithium-ion batteries with it as an artificial solid-electrolyte-interface (SEI) will be fabricated. The functionality of the\nMOF film-based artificial SEI will be explored.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n09-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
