Both alterations in muscle mechanical properties and in neural\ncontrol, such as hyperactive reflexes, contribute to joint hyper-resistance. Yet, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how alterations in\nmuscle properties affect spindle firing, driving stretch reflexes, in response to stretch. This hinders our ability to infer the underlying\npatient-specific causes of hyper-resistance. Limited specificity in diagnosis may lead to suboptimal treatment selection, explaining why\nthe responses to treatment are highly variable. Here, I will develop a mechanistic model of joint hyper-resistance\naimed at identifying neural and muscle contributions to joint hyper-resistance. I will first assess how muscle properties affect spindle\nfiring in response to stretch in a spastic and contracture rat model. Next, I will use the experimental data to develop and validate a\ncomputer model of joint hyper-resistance. Finally, I will use this computer model to identify individual-specific neural and muscle deficits\nunderlying joint hyper-resistance, and the effects of treatment on these deficits in children\nwith CP. My project will contribute to improved diagnosis of joint hyper-resistance problems and will consequently lead to improved\ntreatment selection for a variety of neurological disorders.\nID: \nID: \n211173\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-11-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n31-10-2027\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n25-11-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Currently, we are\napplying for ethical approval at the CCD for all different rat models. For this, we submitted a first version to the IvD (Instituut voor\ndierwelzijn, VU Amsterdam). We received feedback and recently submitted the revised version again. If this version is approved,\nthe application can go further to the CCD and DEC (Dier ethische commissie). Usually, the CCD and DEC follow the decisions of\nthe IvD. We expect to receive ethical approval in the beginning of 2025 (January - March). \nThere is no written agreement on data transfer/ sharing between the VU and KU Leuven. However, prof.

Both alterations in muscle mechanical properties and in neural control, such as hyperactive reflexes, contribute to joint hyper-resistance. Yet, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how alterations in muscle properties affect spindle firing, driving stretch reflexes, in response to stretch. This hinders our ability to infer the underlying patient-specific causes of hyper-resistance. Limited specificity in diagnosis may lead to suboptimal treatment selection, explaining why the responses to treatment are highly variable. Here, I will develop a mechanistic model of joint hyper-resistance aimed at identifying neural and muscle contributions to joint hyper-resistance. I will first assess how muscle properties affect spindle firing in response to stretch in a spastic and contracture rat model. Next, I will use the experimental data to develop and validate a computer model of joint hyper-resistance. Finally, I will use this computer model to identify individual-specific neural and muscle deficits underlying joint hyper-resistance, and the effects of treatment on these deficits in children with CP. My project will contribute to improved diagnosis of joint hyper-resistance problems and will consequently lead to improved treatment selection for a variety of neurological disorders.

Ethical approval of the CCD (Centrale commissie Dierproeven) was already obtained to perform pilot data collection in contracture and healthy rats (AVD11200202114471). Currently, we are applying for ethical approval at the CCD for all different rat models. For this, we submitted a first version to the IvD (Instituut voor dierwelzijn, VU Amsterdam). We received feedback and recently submitted the revised version again. If this version is approved, the application can go further to the CCD and DEC (Dier ethische commissie). Usually, the CCD and DEC follow the decisions of the IvD. We expect to receive ethical approval in the beginning of 2025 (January - March). There is no written agreement on data transfer/ sharing between the VU and KU Leuven. However, prof. Maas confirmed that the VU has an 'open science vision' and therefore there are no restrictions in sharing the rat data.
