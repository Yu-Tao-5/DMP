Even the simplest physiological functions, e.g., respiration and  \ncirculation, require the generation of forces. Similarly, biological cells as building blocks of life are constantly  \nsubjected to mechanical forces, e.g., tension, shear, and compression. They can sense those forces and convert them  \ninto biological responses to perform normal functions. In the past decade, studies into the mechanics of cells have  \nrapidly grown with significant implications for biotechnology and human health. For instance, cell and nuclear  \nsoftening have been associated with DNA damage, cancer invasion, and tumour malignancy. This progress has largely  \nbeen facilitated by new capabilities for mechanical assessment at the single-cell level. This project envisages  \npioneering efforts to establish a photoacoustic and photothermal microscopy platform for the non-contact, non-\ninvasive,  and  multiparametric  study  of  cell  mechanics.  We  envision  great  potential  to  advance  our  current  \nknowledge of cell rheology and its connection with cell structural biology. These breakthroughs will moreover open  \nnew paradigms for mechanics-informed disease diagnosis and drug efficacy tests. In that regard, this project also  \naims  at  developing  lab-on-chip  instruments  for  disease  diagnosis  by  coupling  the  developed  platform  with  \nmicrofluidics technology.\nInstitution: KU Leuven\n1.
