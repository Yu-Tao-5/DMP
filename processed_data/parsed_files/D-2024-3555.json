It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all materials that need proper management because they are valuable, difficult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentation/metadata. RDM Guidance on data If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type. Protocols & SOPs : Protocols delivered in frequently used kits ( GeneJET plasmid Miniprep Kit , etc.) or existing standard lab protocols. DNA, DNA & AA sequences : Plasmids containing the sequences of the PKDs, already generated in house will be used as templates. Some of these constructs will be directly used for protein purifications. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number.☐ Yes, human subject data; provide SMEC or EC approval number: ☐ Yes, animal data; provide ECD reference number: ☐ Yes, dual use; provide approval number: ☒ No Additional information: Not applicable Will you process personal data4? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number).☐ Yes (provide PRET G-number or EC S-number below) ☒ No Additional information: Not applicable 4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 8Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin- offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please comment: BLI/anisotropy data of compounds stabilizing our protein-protein interaction may be used for further valorization. In addition, co-crystals of our protein complex with compounds may also be used for further valorization. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Not applicable Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Not applicable 3.Documentation and Metadata FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .Each experiment will be documented in an electronic lab notebook (which will be available in benchling) by the performing scientist following standard operating procedures (SOPs), which will be or have been written down. Each lab notebook has a table of summary containing the background/ rationale with the objective, protocols and samples used, results (referencing digital data) and conclusion. The raw data along with the processed data of each experiment will be sorted per experiment type and stored in document folders on the personal laptop of the performing scientist. The data contains a README.txt file explaining the design/protocol, analysis methods, results, labels used and references to the electronic lab notebook . Metadata will link the data files, lab samples and experimental notes (including descriptions of equipment, setting and used experimental settings), allowing other researchers to follow all the steps performed during data acquisition and processing. For the various forms of publication that require a combination of data from multiple experiments, new folders will be created for the processed data with links to the respective raw data. The folder will be created per publication. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: When depositing data in a local or public repository, the final dataset will be accompanied with a README.txt file containing all relevant information, following the Dublin Core Metadata standard (if no other meta-standard is available yet) . This file will be located in the top-level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used. This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 104.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data.☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☒ Other: NAS (Network-Attached Storage) How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? ☒ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution (KULeuven OneDrive) ☒ Personal back-ups I make (on separate drives, located at different locations) ☒ Other (The data from the Voet lab (crystallography) is saved on a double backup NAS (Synology), which is secure and requires authorization before access). Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No The KU Leuven ICTS provide su fficient storage and archival capacity during the PhD project. Additionally, the Voet lab has 128TB of space on the NAS system, which will cover all crystallography generated data for the next 4 years. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data The data is secured by the 2-factor authentication system of the KU Leuven, while the Synology NAS system is only accessible through authorization. In addition, the personal network drive is encrypted. Confidential data can and will be protected with a password that is only available for the (co-)promotors. Visitors, master thesis and internship students as well as other unauthorized persons will not have access to the data. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?KuLeuven onedrive (up to 250GB) is free for staff members. Separate back-up drives will be bought using the benchfee. The LBMD NAS system is already present and is available for all LBMD members. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☒ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) The raw data files from the X-ray diffraction will not be kept for 10 years, if it has been confirmed that data is not relevant, as the cost of storing the large amount of raw imaging data will be unaffordable. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): After the end of the project, the research data will be stored at the large-volume-storage system of the KULeuven. Dissemination data containing files corresponding to papers and presentations, will be stored on the PCs of involved PIs and backed-up daily on the departmental server for long term storage. Analysis code will be stored on ICTS-hosted code repositories. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?It has been estimated that +- 5 TB storage will be collected in the duration of the project. Currently the ICTS storage pricing is 95 Euro/TB/year, we estimated storage costs at around 4750 Euro (95 * 5TB * 10years) to cover the duration of the project and long-term storage of 10 years. This will be covered by the funding acquired by the project PIs in the context of other research projects. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☐ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☒ Other, please specify: All information, including negative results, will be released at the end of the project to ensure future researchers and AI algorithms can learn from it and prevent repetition. In case we identify promising active compounds, we will consult LRD and may opt to keep results secret while preparing patent applications in order to protect our intellectual property. The data will only be released when the project is finished as of the guidelines of LRD. In case the data is valorizable, it may be kept secret, however, we will strive for the least interesting compounds to be released as part of my PhD while keeping the most promising and valorizable compounds confidential. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.The project collaborators will be authorized to have access to all obtained digital and physical data after the project. For researchers outside of the consortium, the open data can be made available upon e-mail request and under the condition that the users agree to give proper credit through co-authorship on their papers that used the data. Data usage for commercial purposes will require a license or an equivalent arrangement. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☒ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify: Structural data of proteins and compounds, as well as BLI and anisotropy data fall under IP protection. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 14Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Other data repository (specify) ☐ Other (specify) When will the data be made available? ☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT.
