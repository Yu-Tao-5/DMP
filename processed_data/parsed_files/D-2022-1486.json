The disease is caused by rearrangements in the MLL gene resulting in malignant fusion proteins. LEDGF/p75\nserves as an epigenetic reader and tethers transcription complexes containing MLL to chromatin via its PWWP domain.\nRecent studies demonstrated that this process is essential for the onset of MLL-r leukemia, yet it is dispensable for\nhematopoiesis. Consequently, preventing the LEDGF/p75-chromatin interaction should displace the MLL complex from\nchromatin, downregulate MLL expression and reverse the malignant transformation. Here we propose to design and\nvalidate a novel class of small-molecule inhibitors that specifically bind to the nucleosome-recognizing site of\nLEDGF/p75. First, we will perform a direct crystallographic screening using already obtained PWWP domain crystals and\na broad library of drug-like fragments. This recently developed approach is recognized as being efficient and robust. The\nobtained fragment hits will be grown into potential lead compounds through iterative cycles of in silico design, custom\nsynthesis and biophysical in vitro testing to optimize their affinity and activity. The leads will be further evaluated in\ncell-based functional assays and eventually using animal models. Our final goal is to create first-in-class lead\ncompounds for acute MLL-r leukemia.\nLast modified: \n13-07-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
