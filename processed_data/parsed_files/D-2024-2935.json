Humans harnessed this\nunique capability to create plants with desirable agronomic traits. Plant-pathogen interactions are typically determined by complex interaction networks\ninvolving both bacterial effectors and plant host proteins. While research on bacterial DNA transfer and integration has dominated the Agrobacterium field,\nthere is a lack of knowledge on how effectors hijack plant defense responses. This is highlighted by the fact that for many plant species, notably monocots,\ngenetic transformation remains challenging. To address this knowledge gap, we will utilize new techniques in proteomics, based on proximity-dependent\nlabeling, to identify novel effector-host protein interactions within the host cellular environment. Concurrently, we will employ two high-end approaches to\nidentify potential novel effectors. We will characterize proteins translocated by the secretion system within Agrobacterium and identify bacterial proteins\nin planta. Finally, we will functionally characterize novel host proteins in both maize and Arabidopsis and study the importance of both novel effectors and\nhost proteins in infection. Our comprehensive approach will undoubtedly provide a deeper understanding of this intriguing natural interkingdom interaction\nand may lead to improvements in biotechnological applications.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n15-07-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? The data will be stored on the university's central server with automatic daily back-up procedures. In case data is linked to publications, it will be also made available on public databases which have their own storage facilities (e.g. Sequence Read Archive, Genbank of NCBI). Biological data will be stored at 4°C fridges and -20°C and -80°C freezers with limited access. A copy of the bacterial database will be kept at each project partner. Freezers with biological data are located in the labs which have restricted access for unauthorized personnel (e.g. by means of a badge-system). How will the data be backed up?
