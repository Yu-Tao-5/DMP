The FWO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.  At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.        \n FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven       2  1. General Project Information  Name Grant Holder & ORCID Brandán Pedre Pérez, 0000-0003-2158-2807 Contributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Peter Dedecker (supervisor) 0000-0002-1882-2075 Elena Levtchenko (co-supervisor) 0000-0002-8352-7312 Lambertus van den Heuvel (co-supervisor) 0000-0003-3917-6727 Project number 1 & title 1276324N, Genetically-encoded cysteine and cystine biosensors for real-time monitoring and diagnostics Funder(s) GrantID 2 FWO Affiliation(s) X  KU Leuven  ☐ Universiteit Antwerpen ☐ Universiteit Gent  ☐ Universiteit Hasselt ☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  ☐ Other: ROR identifier KU Leuven: 3E230514 \n 1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number. This question is optional. Applicants can only provide one project number.  2 Funder(s) GrantID refers to the number of the DMP at the funder(s), here one can specify multiple GrantIDs if multiple funding sources were used. \n FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven       3  Please provide a short project description Cysteine is an essential amino acid that is required for proper cell functioning via its redox-active thiol group. Dysregulation of cysteine metabolism is implicated in diseases such as cystinosis, while insufficient cysteine supply triggers ferroptosis, a type of cell death with a promising potential in cancer therapy. Despite its seemingly well-established nature, many fundamental aspects in cysteine metabolism remain unknown due to a lack of tools that can efficiently monitor cysteine levels in the native environment, subcellular compartments, and in clinical samples.   This project responds to this technology gap by developing genetically-encoded fluorescent biosensors for cysteine and its oxidized form cystine. These biosensors will combine a fluorescent protein reporter with a specific cysteine or cystine-binding protein. The resulting biosensors can be expressed by cells and will convert the presence of these molecules into a change in fluorescence, that can be read using fluorescence microscopes or plate readers, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of settings. I will then use the sensors in cellulo to understand how cystine is transformed into cysteine intracellularly, as well as to develop a cheaper and faster diagnostic procedure to measure cystine levels in biological samples. These cysteine/cystine biosensors will set the basis for research breakthroughs in cysteine/cystine metabolism, from their use in this project and their use by other researchers.            \n FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven       4  2.

Data stored in personal network drive (I-drive) will be stored in a drawer locked by a key, whose access is restricted to grant holder, supervisor and lab manager.   What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Personal network drives will be purchased using the FWO bench fee. Free data storage capacity provided by KU Leuven OneDrive is enough for this project.     5.

If none, please explain why.  A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT.

How will these costs be covered?   Data deposit in Zenodo repository is free of charge. Open access publication fees depend on type of open access chosen and available funds from the FWO bench fee. Green open access publication is usually free, while I estimate gold open access publication as 3000-4000EUR/publication. Expected cost used for publications ~6000-8000EUR.  7.
