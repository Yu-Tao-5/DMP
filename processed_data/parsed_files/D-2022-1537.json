Interview Data: Recordings (primary; observational; multimedia) will be stored as MP3 files, and\ntranscripts (primary; observational; textual) as Word files. During WP1-4, we anticipate conducting \nsemi-structured interviews with:\n1)Representatives of relevant policy-making bodies in the littoral states and at the relevant supra-national  \nlevels, NGOs related to the shipping industry (e.g., International Chamber of Shipping);\n2)Harm bearers from each category to include individuals (e.g., seafarers or delegates from their  \nrepresentative  organizations),  private-sector entities  (e.g.,  vessel owners,  shipping  firms,  private  \nsecurity companies), government entities (e.g., port authorities, maritime police, coast guard and Navy)  \nand the environment (e.g., environmental NGOs and representatives of affected communities).\nWe will collect the name, e-mail address, and information about the employer/organization the \ninterview participant is involved with. If the interview participants allow it, we will record the \ninterviews, then transcribe the recordings and conduct the analyses. As soon as the interviews have \nbeen transcribed (and fully anonymized), the audio recordings will be deleted. A file-shredding \napplication will be utilized to delete the files, effectively writing, deleting and overwriting the data \nentirely, in order to prevent its recovery.\nThe digital data from interviews will be stored and modified on network drives, which are encrypted,  \nautomatically synchronized, and only be  accessible by Paoli and the appointed researcher. These \nnetwork drives will be back-upped daily. Hence, the digital data will be stored in such a way that loss \nor misuse is prevented at all times. In addition, each file containing personal data will be encrypted \nby the KU Leuven IT services using BitLocker Drive Encryption software and will be stored only on a \nsecured cloud to avoid any misuse of the data gathered.\n2. Interview Analysis/Output:  To include textual analyses (primary; derived; textual) and will be \nstored as NVIVO files.  \nThis digital data will also be stored and modified on network drives, which are encrypted, \nautomatically synchronized, and only be  accessible by Paoli, the co-promotors and the appointed \nresearcher.
