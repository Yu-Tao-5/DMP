FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.The data will be stored in two different locations: (a) The university's central servers/OneDrive (b) an external HDD provided by the hosting lab will be used Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: 2TB of OneDrive storage is available per researcher and provided by the hosting institution, which is free of charge. Archival storage is rented at the KU Leuven ICTS data center and can be expanded depending on the needs. Also, the hosting lab will provide HDD for all members of the team If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7All KU Leuven services are personally authorized, so only the authorized personnel have access to it. All data will be protected by the personal researcher’s password. For all projects done in collaboration with the other groups, only limited access to certain data will be provided and shared which are of interest of both groups. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Microsoft OneDrive License is free of charge for all KU Leuven researchers. Archival data storage is centrally offered via KU Leuven on the University's servers. Additionally, the data can be saved at the HDD provided by the hosting lab. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All collected and used data during FWO project will be stored at the Research Data Respiratory (RDR) of KU Leuven. Also, the copy of the data will be stored at the on an external HDD provided by hosting group and the lab notebook will be stored in the physical archive. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?The data will be stored on the University's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. The HDD of the hosting lab will be used as well. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Data archival at KU Leuven is currently offered at 270 Euro/TB/year. 1TB of storage will be sufficient and the price for storage during 10 years is 2700 Euro. These costs are being covered by the budget of the research group. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 116. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☐ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☒ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: All articles related to the research work which will be published in peer reviewed journals. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.The date obtained during the project will be available after the publication process, while the other, non- published data will be available to the researchers who have the access to the OneDrive folder and group’s HDD. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.The date obtained during the project will be available after the publication process, while the other, non- published data will be available at the OneDrive folder and group’s HDD. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.The data will be available after publication of the research results. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 The obtained results will be published in peer reviewed journals and made available for public. The publications will be stored in digital repository of KU Leuven Association (LIRIAS; https://limo.libis.be/ ). The non-published results, will not be public, but the research team will have an access for the continuation of the work. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes: The publications with appropriate DOI number will be stored in digital repository of KU Leuven Association (LIRIAS; https://limo.libis.be/ ). What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Publishing in the most peer review journals is free of charge. In case of publications fee, cover pages fee, the cost will be covered by the group’s and researcher’s bench fee. 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 137.
