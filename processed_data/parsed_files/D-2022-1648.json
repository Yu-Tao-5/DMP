The pathophysiology of VAPA is still an enigma, while this\nknowledge is vital to be able to identify new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Our project aims to elucidate why and how influenza\nand SARS-CoV-2 lead to invasive aspergillosis while other respiratory viruses do not, by establishing a collection of virus-Aspergillus\nfumigatus co-infection models using optically transparent zebrafish larvae. These zebrafish models will be used to characterize\n(co)infection dynamics and the interplay with the innate immune response, following a number of hypotheses. We will both investigate\ntargeted hypotheses using fluorescence microscopy, as well as spawning new hypotheses using single-cell RNA sequencing.\nLast modified: \n20-03-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
