Documentation and Metadata\nDescribe the documentation that will be created for the data. This section deals with\nthe way in which you will document how the dataset was created and subsequently\nprocessed.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 5\nAt the project level, an extensive metadata file will be assembled which describes in detail the\nsetup and the algorithms used to obtain the data, the generated source code and a\ncomprehensive description of the collected data. The algorithms themselves will not be described\nin this metadata file, but will be available and documented on a KU Leuven GitLab repository,\nallowing for full replicability of all results. Processed data and final code will also be deposited on\na preprint server, such as Zenodo, to allow reproduction of results.\nDescribe the metadata for the data. This section deals with metadata: information\ncontained in your dataset about the research data.\nInitially, the metadata will be registered in .xml files following the DCMI metadata standard. If\ndatasets are shared on open access databases, e.g. on Zenodo, the metadata will be converted\nto the metadata standard required by the respective open access database.\n3. Ethical, Legal and Privacy Issues\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data?\nNo.\nDid you consider all issues about copyrights and IPR?\nYes, the project proposal and phases have been formulated such to maximize applicability in\nglobal markets, by focusing on using data sources that are to a large extent readily available on\nfarms. Farmers will be the end-users of the developed tools, and are owner of the data entered in\nthem. Therefore, no barriers for valorisation of this project were identified. For the developed\nsoftware, we will set the correct licenses and explore IP protection via patents where possible\nand confidentiality where needed in consultation with the technology transfer offices of KU\nLeuven.\nAre the collected data considered to be â€œdata containing personal informationâ€​\nand are all the requirements about the collection of these data met?\nYes, a 3rd party agreement ‘Individual Agreement Data Collection and Processing’ was made with\neach of the dairy farmers that participate in this project. In this agreement, the farmers declare\nthat they give permission to the authorized representatives of the Livestock Technology group\n(KU Leuven), for the collection of data in a period of maximum 5 years and up to no later than\n31/12/2027. Additionally, they allow the use, processing and anonymization of the data within\nthe framework of the FertiHealth project and further research in the Livestock Technology group\nafter the data collection period. These contracts directly concern data derived from the farm\nmanagement software (DeLaval Delpro) back-ups and treatment and disease registers (specified\nunder §2). In addition, in this agreement, the farmers declare that they give permission to the\nauthorized representative of the Livestock Technology group to collect their milk recording data,\ninsemination and pregnancy check-up details and genetic and genomic data that are stored in\nthe CRV database.\n4. Data storage and Backup during Research\nHow and where will the data be stored during research?\nCentrally on storage facilities of the research unit\nIn a cloud service offered by the university\n1. All raw data is stored on a by the group managed Synology data storage unit running in RAID5\nand backed-up weekly to the groups SharePoint (WET – Livestock Technology/Documents/LT Data\nCloud Storage/).\n2. The raw data are merged into a PostgreSQL database that is stored on a by the group\nmanaged server running Ubuntu and backed-up weekly to the Synology data storage unit\n(/Database/) and the groups SharePoint (WET – Livestock Technology/Documents/LT Data Cloud\nStorage/Database/).\n3. Processed data & results are stored on the laptop of the researcher and synched to the\nresearcher’s KU Leuven-hosted OneDrive share (e.g. '/Users/Dyan Meuwissen/OneDrive – KU\nLeuven/PhD Research/').\n4. Software code is stored on the laptop of the researcher and pushed to the researcher’s KU\nLeuven-hosted Gitlab repository (e.g. 'https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/livestock-\ntechnology/dmeuwissen/ PhDResearch/).\n5. Processed data and final code will also be deposited on a preprint server, such as Zenodo.\nWhich back-up procedures are in place?\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 5\n1. The by the group managed Synology data storage unit is running in RAID5.\n2. For the by the group managed server (database) a weekly backup is made to the Synology.\n3. A weekly backup of the Synology is stored on the groups SharePoint (WET – Livestock\nTechnology/Documents/LT Data Cloud Storage/).\n4. The laptops of the researchers are synched with their KU Leuven-hosted OneDrive share (e.g.\n'/Users/Dyan Meuwissen/OneDrive – KU Leuven/PhD Research/').\n5. The groups SharePoint and the researcher’s OneDrive cloud storage are hosted by KU Leuven\nand thus underly the Universities back-up procedures.\nThe KU Leuven hosted services (SharePoint - scalable, OneDrive - 2 TB, GitLab - scalable) are\nsufficient for data needs. Further the server used to host the database (1 TB SSD + 2TB) and the\nconnected Synology data storage unit (24 TB) offer sufficient storage to store and backup all raw\nand processed data.\nDescribe the data security procedures and who has access to the data.\nSecure access to all KU Leuven hosted services (GitLab, OneDrive, SharePoint) is only given to\nauthorized personal KU Leuven accounts. Both the server and Synology data storage unit are\nonly accessible through the KU Leuven-hosted VPN and additionally secured by personal\naccounts/passwords. All data that will be shared or disseminated to third parties will be\nanonymized, as specified in the data agreements (specified under §3).\n5. Data selection and Preservation after Research\nWhat is the long-term preservation plan for these dataset(s)?\nAll data described under §1 will be retained until at least 5 years after the end of the project.\nAll data will be archived on the Synology data storage unit (RAID5) of the research group for at\nleast 5 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. This Synology is backed-up weekly to the\ngroup’s SharePoint hosted by KU Leuven.\nGiven that the storage unit/server are self-hosted, the annual costs are mainly regarding the\nmaintenance of these systems. These costs will be covered by follow-up projects.\nData Selection: Which data will have long time value for the research and will be\npreserved?\nAll raw data, processed data, scripts, reports, presentations and manuscripts.\n6. Data Sharing\nAre there any restrictions for sharing the data?\nYes, raw data from the farms needs to be anonymized before it can be shared. It can only be\naccessed, used and published under the requirements specified under the data agreements. Any\nadditional use of the data that is not specified in these agreements or that does not comply to\nthese agreements, needs to be authorised by the respective dairy farmers and CRV.\nFollowing data will be made publicly available by the end of the project:\n1. Preprints of articles containing anonymized research results will be available on a preprint\nserver, such as Zenodo, upon submission.\n2. Published articles containing anonymized research results will be made available by the\npublisher conform to their restrictions (open-access or not).\n3. All source code is stored on KU Leuven GitLab and access is shared with supervisors and\nauthorized colleagues. Scripts, functions and snips of code that are not valorizable will be made\npublicly available on the KU Leuven Gitlab by the end of the project.\n(Un)processed data from and about the farms will not be made publicly available, as specified in\nthe data agreements. To authorized personnel of Livestock Technology (KU Leuven) and other\nresearchers/collaborators (KU Leuven or non-KU Leuven), the data will be available immediately\nafter collection, when the data is stored on the Synology and integrated in the database on the\nlocal server.\nIf there are no restrictions, which mechanisms will be in place to assure that the data\nare discoverable, accessible and intelligible?\nPostgreSQL database containing the merged and linked raw and processed data on the local\nserver (backup on Synology). Metadata file on the database structure, tables and headers.\nLogical folder structure for the raw data files.\nMetadata file to explain the folder structure and the content of the raw data files.\nHow will you share the data?\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 5\nRepository\nPublication\n1.
