A global metadata file (Excel sheet) will be provided that contains a list of all the code versions names , validation experiments with corresponding date, type of data and in which folder to find that data. Metadata will be provided for experimental data in the form of txt -files. The file will contain all information on dat e of experiment, parameters used , experiment protocol (workflow ) and how to process the data or use/display/interpret the results. The code to validate t his data will also be added. The clinical data (e.g. CTs ) will be clearly described in an Excel file and all processed data and corresponding recon structions will be named in the same fi le. The parameters will also be added. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 8 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: Folder organization: the folders will have a hierarchical structure with general superfolders dividing different categories ( Workspace, Ultrasound Segmentation, Robot control , etc.) . Each superfolder will contain several levels of s ubfolders with logical names, each level becoming more specific up to the single experiment level. Folder names will be clear and descriptive. The most specific level will have a folder name containing: experiment name (or acronym) corresponding to the nam e in the global metadata file, date, type of data, researcher name (or initials). In eac h experiment folder, a ReadMe file will be provided that specifies the experiment methodology, used equipment and how to process the data or use/display/interpret the results. All code will contain sufficient commentary for ease of use by non -authors. 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? KUL Onedrive and copy on personal KUL hard drive. Code will also be stored on Github. Large data sets could be stored on the KUL L drive. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9 How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS , STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON -DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH .7 REFER TO INSTITUTION -SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE . The general ICT back -up policy that KUL uses for Onedrive is applied. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: One Drive provides 2TB safe cloud drive for KU Leuven staff, which is sufficient for all data storage. The KUL L drive has more storage for larger data sets, and a KUL hard drive of 2TB will also be used. If no, please specify : How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 7 Access to the shared drive is only granted to authorized researchers from the research group. GitHub access is also only granted to the appropriate contributors. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? 2TB One Drive storage provided by KU Leuven (with a free extension possibility of up to 5TB ) is sufficient for all data storage. No cost for data storage is fores een. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). All research data will be stored in storage facilities of the research unit and will be kept for minimally 5 years post finalization of the project. All data will be anonymized before storage (and will be obtained/used only after approval of the corresponding ethical committees). Relevan t quantitative research data will be generated during the project. This includes data crucial for verification and reproduction of research results, data that is obtained at great time cost, and data of scientific value. Naturally, any restrictions related to personal data (e.g., informed consent or insufficient anonymization) will be taken into account to determine the preservation. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? All research data will be stored in storage facilities of the research unit or on KU Leuven’s servers and behind proper authentication. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? A large amount of raw and derived data will be stored for the long -term evaluation . Therefore, adequate resources will be allocated in the research expenses budget (estimated 120EUR/ TB each year) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILA BLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY .
