However, Catholic\ntheologians do not participate in this research area, and choreographers hesitate to work with Christian rituals. Yet, during the twentieth\ncentury there have been precedents of “liturgical dance”. Especially in Belgium, liturgical dance was rooted in a fruitful collaboration\nbetween artistic modern dance and the Catholic Church. Today, this liturgical dance practice has been virtually erased from the collective\nmemory. So far, studies have not explained these peculiar changes. Moreover, no liturgical dance practices exist in Belgium,\ndespite contemporary dance’s interest in ritualistic performances and reenactments. The project proposes to utilize this unique\nopportunity to initiate a dialogue between dance studies and liturgical theology. It will use the artistic method of choreographic\nreenactment to research liturgical dance as a contemporary artistic and liturgical-theological phenomenon. To perform this practice-as-\nresearch, the project will address the historical changes and renegotiate the objections against liturgical dance, raised by Catholic Church\nauthorities with special attention to the topics of “sacramentality”, “inculturation” and “active participation”. These reenactments will offer\nnew insight in these three crucial topics, resulting in a pioneering study in “dance theology” as a theoretical and practical branch of\ntheology.\nLast modified: \n24-03-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Last modiﬁed 24 March 2023\n5 of 7\nYes\nI will use Zotero to add annotation and structure the data. It will be used to managed references and structure the textual and archival material, and audio and video files. \n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nOneDrive for Business is a Microsoft cloud solution to securely store documents and files. After the project, the data will be stored at rdr.kuleuven.be. \nHow will the data be backed up?\nA back-up is provided via automatic version management of the files in OneDrive, maintaining up to 100 versions per file.\nA second copy will be kept on the drive within the secure KU Leuven environment. Automatic version management of the files occurs when storing data in the KU Leuven datacenters. Version\nmanagement is done using \"snapshot\" technology, where the previous versions of the changed files are kept online in a snapshot on the same storage system. A mirror (an exact copy) of the data\nis provided in the second ICTS data center for “business continuity” or “disaster recovery” purposes; a file is copied to the second data center as soon as it is written to a drive. ICTS can put the\ncopy online within an hour in case of disaster with the primary storage.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nAll KU Leuven personnel has access to 2 TB of data storage on OneDrive. As the estimated sizes of the datasets <50 GB, sufficient storage and backup capacity is available. \nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nDue to the personal nature of OneDrive, files that you do not explicitly share are not accessible to anyone else. As such, a separate folder will be created for this dataset. \nKU Leuven network drive, specifically L-drive. The KU Leuven network drives are incorporated within secured KU Leuven environments, are password-protected (including smartphone-based\nmulti-factor identification) and are only accessible by registered collaborating researchers. Only the PI can request access to the network drive for study personnel.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nOneDrive for Business is free for staff and students of KU Leuven.\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be\npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\nDigital data: The generated research data necessary to reuse the data will be transferred to rdr.kuleuven.be for long-term data archiving (10 years), managed by KU Leuven ICTS.\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for at least 5 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. KU Leuven offers support and checks the\ndata. \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nKULeuven offers data preservation options (such as rdr.kuleuven.be) for free for research data (<50G). In case the size of the research data would surpass this limit, the costs will be payed with\nthe bench fee. \n5. Data sharing and reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made\navailable.\nYes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …)\nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.\nScientific researchers will have to motivate why they want access to the data:\nWhat topic are you studying?\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
