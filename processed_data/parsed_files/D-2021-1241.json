This framework will be used to uncover the dominant dissolution mechanism,\nleading to new insights into the effects of pyrometallurgical process parameters on the\ndissolution of these PGM particles, useful for interpreting observations from and optimizing\nindustrial recovery operations. Once the framework is established, it could be applied to different\nrecovery processes as well, increasing its relevance to the industry.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? The full dataset will be available and can be used by anyone and for any purpose, provided that they give appropriate credit, i.e. reference to the related publications and/or doi of the data set. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered? There are no extra costs associated with the data sharing. Zenodo and NIST are free of charge. 8.
