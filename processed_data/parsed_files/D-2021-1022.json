Deep learning will be used to efficiently identify the weakest locations in a virtual\ncoupon (hot spots). During a research stay, a convolutional neural network will be developed and\ntrained for this purpose based on coarse finite element (FE) models. The FE models will use\nmicrostructures generated by a newly developed 3D microstructure generator, which is trained\nbased on deep learning of computed tomography (CT) data. Once the hot spots have been\nidentified, only a few refined FE models will be required to detect where the kink band initiation\nwill be triggered, which then leads to compressive failure. This procedure will be applied to both\nquasistatic and fatigue compressive loading, and predictions will be based on input parameters\nthat are objectively measured on the actual constituents. Experimental validation will be\nperformed based on compressive strength, compression-compression fatigue life and the actual\nmicromechanisms observed in CT data.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
