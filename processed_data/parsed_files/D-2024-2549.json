Unfortunately, the last two decades of research on microarchitectural side-\nchannels has shown that these optimizations often come at the  expense of security. Hardware-software co-design are a promising solution to mitigate\nthese attacks at an acceptable cost. However, research on hardware software co-design is challenging. Designing hardware defenses that provide\nprovable end-to-end security, requires to (1) formalize the guarantees of these defenses with hardware-software security contracts, (2) implement\nsoftware that are secure according to the contract, and (3) validate that the hardware implementation complies with the contract.\nThe general goal of this project is to support the development of hardware-software co-design for end-to-end security. First, we will develop compiler\nthat transparently enforce software-level properties required by hardware defenses. Second, we will build a modular toolchain to validate that hardware\ndefenses comply with their security contract. Finally, we will investigate new security conditions to enable end-to-end provable security for\ncryptographic primitives.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n03-05-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
