The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\n1.General Information\nName applicant Maximiliano Udenio Castro\nFWO Project Number & Title G0D2222N -       Inventory management in times of environmental uncertainty\nAffiliation ☒ KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent\n☐ Universiteit Hasselt  \n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel\n☐ Other: \n2.Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make  \nuse of existing data?  ☒ Generate new data\n☒ Reuse existing data\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 2Describe the origin, type and format of the data \n(per dataset) and its (estimated) volume\nIf you reuse existing data, specify the source of these \ndata. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from \ndata formats (the technical format).For this research, secondary data will be used in WP1. In particular, the FactSet Revere database and the S&P \nCompustat dataset. The supervisor already has access to both, a personal Revere subscription is hosted by the ICT \ndepartment of the Faculty of Economics and Business. The same faculty also has a campus-wide license for the \nCompustat dataset.\nThe data type of these datasets is public financial firm data. Storage requirements for these datasets are modest (in \nthe order of 100Gb) all data is stored as csv text files.  \nFor the other WP’s, simulation data will be generated and used; the type will be demand data generated from \nstatistical distributions.
