This research project delves into the historical context of biological fatherhood, focusing on 19th -century \nillegitimacy in Western Europe, where ca. 7 -8% of children were born to unwed mothers and mostly later legitimized \nby their mothers' husbands. While microdata suggests that these husbands were often the biological fathers, the \nextent and nature of these relationships are unexplored. Our genetic genealogical study employs a citizen science \napproach, analyzing 500 ‘genealogical pairs’ of male relatives with a case of a premarital child born in 19th -century \nBelgium. Using Y -chromosome comparison and archival microdata, we aim to unravel the scale and motivations \nbehind men's decisions to legitimize children in the 19th century, particularly in cases where they were not the \nbiological fathers.  \n \nID: 212618  \n \nStart date: 01-10-2024  \n \nEnd date: 30-09-2028  \n \nLast modified: 03-03-2025  \n \n  \nPATERNITY UNVEILED: GENETIC GENEALOGY ON PREMARITAL \nOFFSPRING IN 19TH CENTURY WESTERN EUROPE  \nRESEARCH DATA SUMMARY  \n \nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your \nresearch project.

If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the relevant \nethical approval number.  \n \n● Yes, human subject data (Provide SMEC or EC approval number below)  \nDatasets no. 4, 5 and 6 are based on personal genetic data and thus require ethical approval by a federally \nacknowledged ethical committee.  \nWe are in the process of preparing a request for ethical appraisal at the Ethics Committee Research UZ / KU Leuven \n(EC Research).  \n \n \nWill you process personal data? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and \nprovide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number).  \n \n● Yes (Provide PRET G -number or EC S -number below)  \nDataset no. 1 will contain personal data and will serve as the key file for the pseudonymisation of other datasets. \nEach of the participants will receive a persistent identifier (PID) that will serve to connect the different datasets.  \nUpon receiving datasets no. 2 & 3, all personal information relating to the citizen scientist and to living relatives will be  \nreplaced by the PIDs from dataset no.1.  \nThe identifiers of the samples from dataset no. 4 will also be added to dataset no. 1, as to maintain a single PID for \neach person implicated in the study.  \nDatasets no. 5, 6, 7 and 8 are derivatives of the already mentioned pseudonymised datasets, therefore they will be \npseudonymised from their conception.  \nDataset no. 9 will be the result of an anonymous survey among participants, so no personal information will be \nrecorded intentionally.  \nThus, the most vulnerable personal data will only be available in dataset no. 1, containing risks of data breaches to a \nsingle document. Appropriate measures to ensure the safety of this file will be taken (encryption and safe storage \nlocation).  \nWe are in the process of preparing PRET appraisal (G -2025 -9139).  \n \n \nDoes your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin -offs, \ncommercial exploitation, …)?  If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate.   \n \n● No \n \n \nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material \nor Data transfer agreements, Research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain in the comment \nsection to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.  \n \n● No \n \n \nAre there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related \nto the data you (re)use? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and which \nrestrictions will be asserted.  \n \n● No \n \n \nDOCUMENTATION AND METADATA  \n \nClearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep \ndata understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of \ndocumentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, \ncodebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded).   \n \nEach dataset will be accompanied by a README file outlining its conception context, general form, contents, and \nwhat projects and publications it was used for.  \n \n \nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data?    \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard will be used.  \n \nIf not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.   \n \n● Yes \nThe data we intend to share will be published at KU Leuven Research Data Repository, hence DataCite will be used \nas metadata standard.  \n \n \n \nDATA STORAGE & BACK -UP DURING THE RESEARCH PROJECT  \n \nWhere will the data be stored?  \n \n● Sharepoint online  \n● Other (specify below)  \n(Pseudonymised) datasets 2, 3, and 6 through 9 will be stored at our labs' SharePoint. Dataset no. 1 containing \npersonal information and the key to pseudonymisation will be kept on the projectmanagers' OneDrive provided by KU \nLeuven, during the course of the project. Afterwards it will pass on to the PI's OneDrive.  \nDataset 5 will be stored on the Cloud Storage service provided by Genomics Core.  \n \n \nHow will the data be backed up?  \n \n● Standard back -up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution  \n \n \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project?  \n \nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, explain how this will be taken care of.   \n \n● Yes \nAs of this moment, only this project will be using the lab's SharePoint is only reserved for this specific project. Should \nthis change in the future, other options will be explored, such as the KU Leuven network drives.  \nThe current Gold Tier membership Cloud Storage provided by Genomics Core is sufficient for this project.  \n \n \nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized \npersons?   \n \nThe SharePoint Team site is only accessible for members of our laboratory. Moreover, the datasets stored there will \nnot contain sufficient information to link it back to specific participants. The pseudonymisation key will be kept \nseparate from these datasets at all times during and after the project.  \n \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs \nbe covered?  \n \nThe costs associated with the Cloud Storage provided by Genomics Core are accounted for in the research project \nbudget. For all other datasets in this research project,  KU Leuven currently provides sufficient free storage.  \n \n \n \nDATA PRESERVATION AFTER THE END OF THE RESEARCH PROJECT  \n \nWhich data will be retained for 10 years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are \napplicable) after the end of the project?  \n \nIn case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual \nrestrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).  \n \n● All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy  \nThe saliva kits from dataset no. 4 will be destroyed once they have lost their purpose (namely: after sequencing).  \nDatasets no. 1, 2, 3, 5 and 9 will be kept for at least 10 years to ensure reproducibility, verification and the potential \nfor future reuse or re -evaluation.  \nDatasets no. 6 and 7 will be kept indefinitely because of their potential uses for future research and their low risk of \ndata breaches.   \n \n \nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)?   \n \n● KU Leuven RDR  \n● Other (specify below)  \nDatasets 2, 3, and 6 through 9 datasets will be archived at our SharePoint Team site for future projects. Dataset 5 will \nbe stored at the Genomics Core Cloud Storage for as long as our laboratory is a Gold Tier member. Should storage \nprove insufficient due to other projects competing for space at SharePoint or should we lose our Gold Tier \nmembership at Genomics Core, KU Leuven shared network drives will be a second option.  \nA pseudonymised, non -retraceable version of dataset no. 3 and 8 will be stored at RDR as well, mostly for data \nsharing purposes.  \n \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these \ncosts be covered?  \n \nAs SharePoint Team sites and RDR are free at KU Leuven, we do not expect costs. The Genomics Core Gold Tier \nmembership is covered through internal laboratory funds. Should storage space prove insufficient or Genomics Core \nGold Tier membership too expensive, and KU Leuven shared network drives are needed, internal laboratory funds \nwill be designated for this purpose.  \n \n \n \nDATA SHARING AND REUSE  \n \nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?   \nPlease explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available.  \n \n● Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only)  \n● No (closed access)  \n● Yes, as open data  \nBecause of sensitivities around both genetic and personal data, the majority of our datasets will not be shared  \noutside our laboratory, in particular datasets no. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 (see below). Dataset no. 9 is intended for internal \nreview of the project, hence sharing is not deemed scientifically useful. Since dataset no. 4 will be destroyed before \nthe end of the project, sharing is not an option.  \nDataset no. 3 will be available as  restricted data  for future scholars. Names of participants will have been \npseudonymised and the key file will not be provided, ensuring participants anonymity for future researchers.  \nA pseudonymised, non -retraceable version of dataset no. 8 will be made available as open data . This dataset will \nserve as the basis of future publications, so the data is meant for verification of scientific validity.  \n \n \nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.   \n \nThe restricted data will be accessible for future scholars in the field, seeking to further our understanding of the topic. \nBecause of cultural and possible familial sensitivities around premarital children, this data will only be shared with \nreputable scholars with a record in the field and who are fully aware of these sensitivities.  \n \n \nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an \nagreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?  \n \nPlease explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.  \n \n● Yes, other  \n● Yes, privacy aspects  \n● Yes, ethical aspects  \nBecause of sensitivities around both genetic and personal data, the majority of our datasets will not be shared outside \nour laboratory, in particular datasets no. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7.   \nAs mentioned before, sharing of dataset no. 1 is impossible for privacy reasons because it contains highly personal \ndata. Datasets 2 and 7, even when pseudonymised, contain a lot of information on family relationships and kinship \nthat is less than a century old. In line with the way the Belgian State Archives deal with this issue, we intend not to \nshare such inimate data out of privacy concerns.  \nBecause genetic data is highly personal, and ethics discussions around it are still an evolving topic in bio -ethics, we \ndo not intend to share dataset 5. This is also why dataset no. 4 will be destroyed after the sequencing analyses, \nrendering the discussion of sharing this dataset obsolete.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhere will the data be made available?   \n \nIf already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.  \n \n● Other (specify below)  \n● KU Leuven RDR (Research Data Repository)  \nDataset no. 3 and no. 8 will be made available, in pseudonymised, non -retraceable form, and as respectively \nrestricted and open data, through KU Leuven RDR. As part of publications, variations or selections of dataset no. 8 \nmight also be published as Supplementary data, depending on journal requirements.  \n \n \nWhen will the data be made available?   \n \n● Upon publication of research results  \n \n \nWhich data usage licenses are you going to provide?  \n \nIf none, please explain why.   \n \n● CC-BY 4.0 (data)  \n● Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data)  \n \n \nDo you intend to add a persistent identifier (PID) to your dataset(s), e.g. a DOI or accession number?
