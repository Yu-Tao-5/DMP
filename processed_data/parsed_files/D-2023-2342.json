The main approach for alleviating catastrophic forgetting is replay, which involves storing examples of past tasks in a memory\nbuffer and revisiting them when training on later tasks. However, recently we discovered that replay still suffers from substantial forgetting when\nlearning a new task, but that this forgetting is temporary and followed by a phase of performance recovery. We called this surprising but consistently\nobservable phenomenon the 'stability gap'. In this project, we propose (1) to study the root causes of the stability gap with a set of ablation experiments\nand through visualizing the optimization trajectory, (2) to explore connections between the stability gap and a comparable phenomenon of temporary\nforgetting in humans described in the cognitive science literature, and (3) to develop new continual learning methods that are able to overcome the\nstability gap.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n30-01-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
