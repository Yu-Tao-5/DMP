In that period, the Belgian territorial administrator Ferdinand Van de Ginste,\ninspired by ‘scientific’ notions and ideas about ‘race’ from the field of physical anthropology, ordered the excavation of many graves in Feshi and its\nsurrounding villages. This resulted in 228 skulls being sent for further research to the (Belgian) Congo Museum of Tervuren in 1947. This research\nproject proposes to investigate local memories and testimonies of this traumatic event, which has taken on a renewed significance in the Belgian\ncontext of decolonization politics. Instead of facilitating a unilateral political pathway of repatriation for these human remains, this research project\nwants to break away from a predominantly European decolonization debate by investigating the contemporary (affective, social, cultural and political)\nrelevance of this historical event, both on the community and the national level. Based on new exploratory research data, the proposed project\naddresses the continuing impact and relevance of effaced colonial histories as well as the contemporary disparities they continue to engender. By\nforegrounding the rarely heard voices of affected parties in source communities, the project will make a significant contribution to the possible design\nof a broader and more inclusive and horizontal politics of collaboration, including scientific and academic collaboration, to address the thorny ethical\nand political issues raised in contemporary debates on decolonisation and repatriation in a more equitable way.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n29-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
