It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all materials that need proper management because they are valuable, difficult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentation/metadata. RDM Guidance on data If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 7Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number.☐ Yes, human subject data; provide SMEC or EC approval number: ☒ Yes, animal data; provide ECD reference number: 175/2023 ☐ Yes, dual use; provide approval number: ☐ No Additional information: We will conduct animal experiments, more specifically on killifish, in accordance with the standard laboratory safety rules. All necessary safety measures for both laboratory and animal experiments will be strictly observed. Our methods follow the guidelines and rules set by the HSE Department (Health, Safety and Environment) and the Animal Ethics Committee at KU Leuven. Will you process personal data4? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number).☐ Yes (provide PRET G-number or EC S-number below) ☒ No Additional information: Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin- offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please comment: Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 83.Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .We will keep records for each work package for 10 years (where applicable): Digital data: - Experimental design and protocol (.docx file) - List of abbreviations used (.docx file) - Data structure documentation (.docx file) - Data analysis steps and relevant scripts (MATLAB, Python, ImageJ and Imaris scripts) - Raw data (specific file format according to data type) - Analyzed data (.xlsx and .prism) - Index file/readme file (.txt file) for each work package, detailing the names, locations (folder and subfolder structure), and descriptions of the aforementioned files. Physical data: Samples collected during experiments will be documented and preserved for the duration of the project. Depending on the sample type, they will be stored in fixatives or freezers. Immunohistologically stained slides will be stored in appropriate containers in a dry place or freezer. Due to the nature of these samples, they cannot be kept for 10 years and they will be discarded when analyses have been concluded. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: The experiments are unique, but the data will be standardized according to data-type across experiments to make it easier to interpret the structure. Metadata standards will be used for transcriptomics (https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/content/recipes/interoperability/transcriptomics-metadata.html). For all other data, metadata will be created using the Dublin core (http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards/dublin-core).
