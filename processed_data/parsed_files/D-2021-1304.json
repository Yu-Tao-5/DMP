Later , CMS22 \ndevelops into hyperphagia and obesity. These phenotypes share striking similarities with Prader -Willi \nsyndrome (PWS) and most patients are initially misdiagnosed with PWS. Our group has been on the \nforefront in establishing CMS22, developing new di agnostic assays and treatment plans as well as \nunraveling of the biological function of PREPL. However, much of the cellular function of PREPL and its \nmolecular connection with PWS remains unknown. Therefore, this project will focus on unraveling \nPREPL’s c ellular function in cell culture models and knockout mice. In addition, I will assess the effect \nof patient point mutations on PREPL’s catalytic and non -catalytic functions as point mutations are \nunderstudied, but most common, in CMS22 patients. Furthermor e, I will investigate molecular links \nbetween CMS22 and PWS and, in collaboration with Dr. Florian Merkle (University of Cambridge, UK), \nI will unravel PREPL’s function in hypothalamic neurons, a main cell type involved in metabolic \ndysregulation of both d iseases. Clarifying the cellular function of PREPL and the contribution of PREPL \nin PWS will be a breakthrough which will lead to improved diagnosis and novel treatment plans.  \n1.
