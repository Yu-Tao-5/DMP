The FWO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months a3er the oﬃcial start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submiIed to FWO but to the research co-ordina3on oﬃce of the host ins3tute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.  At the end of the project, the ﬁnal version of the DMP has to be added to the ﬁnal report of the project; this should be submiIed to FWO by the supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its ﬁrst version. The DMP is an element in the ﬁnal evalua3on of the project by the relevant expert panel.

Dis+nguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the technical format).We will generate: - Mathema=cal proofs, - So3ware code, - Proof code.3.Ethical and legal issues Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use AND add the reference to your ﬁle in your host ins3tu3on's privacy register.
