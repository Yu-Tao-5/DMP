This approach involves the application of a biocompatible and bioactive restorative\nmaterial on the pulp to encourage the formation of a protective mineralized bridge. However, the clinical technique and materials used in\nvital pulp therapy have still many drawbacks such as low predictability, poor esthetic result and difficult handling. Therefore, the main\nproject aims are: 1) to create a new in-vitro pulp tissue platform for testing biomaterials, 2) to assess experimental bioactive formulations\nfor their reparative potential and, 3) ultimately develop a reliable pulp-capping technique and material for clinical trials. Additionally, using\nthe newly developed tissue platform, we intend to investigate the underlying mechanisms of pulpal regeneration following vital pulp\ntherapy procedures, which today remain insufficiently understood.\nID: \nID: \n212629\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-10-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n30-09-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n30-03-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
