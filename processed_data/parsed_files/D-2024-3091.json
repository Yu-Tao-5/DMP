Specific examples information on the methodology used to collect the data analytical and procedural information how raw data have been processed into other forms of data standard operating procedures (SOPs), logbooks, lab protocols parameters and instrument settings for image acquisition, measurements, models or other techniques The final dataset will be accompanied by this information under the form of a README.txt document. This file will be located in the top level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used. This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored?

All human tissue samples will be registered with a Belgian biobank, in compliance with the Belgian law on human body material (dd 19-12-2008). Omics data: omics data generated during the project will either be stored on KU Leuven servers Cell lines: Newly human created cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid nitrogen storage and will be deposited in the UZ Leuven-KU Leuven Biobank.

How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Samples will be stored in the archive of O&N3, Campus Gasthuisberg. This room has a separate key to open the door. Access to O&N3 is controlled by electronic badge readers. The primary storage location for the data is on password-protected KU Leuven personal computers, with immediate backup to secure network-attached, redundant disk arrays managed by the lab, accessible only to selected members of the lab. Long term storage for data that does not require repeated fast access is provided by the KU Leuven ICTS' Large Volume Storage service.
