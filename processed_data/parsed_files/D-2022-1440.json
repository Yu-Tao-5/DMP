The\nmonoterpene linalool for example is mainly used in flavors and fragrances, green solvents,\nplatform chemicals and active agents and its market size is projected to surpass USD 1.9 billion\nby 2024. However, traditional methods of monoterpene production - plant extraction and\nchemical synthesis - are not sustainable and inefficient, due to cumbersome processes, high\nenergy consumption and low yields. Large-scale and low-cost microbial production of\nmonoterpenes is therefore crucial to establish a sustainable and economically viable supply of\nmonoterpenes. However, despite several research efforts, it has become clear that rational\nengineering of the heterologous monoterpene pathways alone will not lead to economically\nviable yields. This is mainly due to (i) fundamental shortcomings of current production strains,\nwhich have low pathway fluxes, (ii) monoterpene cytotoxicity and (iii) suboptimal natural\nmonoterpene synthases. This project uses the complementary expertise of both partners to\ncomprehensively tackle these problems, using high-throughput screening methods, cutting-edge\nsynthetic biology tools and enzyme engineering. Ultimately, we will create a portfolio of chassis\nstrains that can serve as â€˜plug-and-play' strains for production of a plethora of monoterpenes.\nAs proof-of-concept, we will develop production strains for three high-value monoterpenes:\nlinalool, limonene and cineole.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNo\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nNo\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 8\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nYes\nOwnership of the generated data belongs to KU Leuven & VIB in accordance with the framework\nagreement between these institutes; copyright of the data belongs to Kevin Verstrepen.\n It should\nbe noted that part of the research is carried out in collaboration with TIB, more information on\nthe agreement between KU Leuven, VIB and TIB can be found in the answer to the next\nquestion. \nWe identify in an early phase the valorization potential of research lines and our group has a vast\nnetwork of industrial contacts to efficiently start the route to commercialization. The lab is\nsupported in this matter by Dr. Stijn Spaepen, IOF innovation manager responsible for research\nvalorization. For research with valorization potential, the host lab actively protects its IP by filling\npatent applications with support from the IP department of VIB. Type of data with potential for\ntech transfer and valorization include yeast strains  generated during the timeframe of this\nproject (including phenotypic data), sequencing information generated during the timeframe of\nthis project and (analysis) data and models hereof derived. Valorization potential includes a)\nlicensing of (improved) strains or information on linking a specific sequence variant to a\nphenotype and b) creation or participation in start-up companies.\n \n \nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nYes\nExisting agreements between VIB and KU Leuven do not restrict publication of data.\n There is no\nIP on the generated strains that would prevent us from storing the strains, performing the\nanticipated experiments or publishing the results. \n \nIt should be noted that part of the research is carried out in collaboration with TIB in China.\nHence, there is a collaboration agreement in place between VIB, KU Leuven and TIB (the Chinese\npartner in this FWO project). This agreement stipulates the following:  \n\"Results are owned by the Party that generated them. Each Party is entitled to valorise its own\nResult at its own discretion. The Parties shall not exploit or valorise jointly owned Results without\nfirst putting in place a joint ownership agreement in which Parties shall specify in which Territory\nand/or Field each Party take the lead for commercialization and how any renumeration of the\nexploitation of the Jointly Owned Results shall be shared with the other Party.\"\nFor all strains used in this project, we will check, together with René \nCusters\n (Regulatory &\nResponsible Research Manager at VIB) whether we need to comply with the Nagoya protocol on\nAccess to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their\nUtilization. In case we need to comply, we will meet certain diligence obligations under EU\nRegulation (EU) No 511/2014 (apply for ‘Prior Informed Consent’ document and negotiate\n‘Mutually Agreed Terms” with Competent National Authority of the provider country).\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nData will be generated following standardized protocols. Data will be documented by the\nresearch and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in\ntheir (electronic) laboratory notebook. Cryotubes of biological samples (bacterial and yeast\nstrains) stored at -80°C will be labelled with a reference number that links to an entry in our\nstrain database.\nDigital data files will be stored on KU Leuven servers and will be accompanied with a READ ME\ntext file that contains relevant metadata for understanding and re-use of data.\nThe READ ME file will be structured as follows:\n \nPROJECT INFORMATION\nP01. Project name/nickname, including name of funder, type of grant, grant number\nP02. Name and contact of the Principal Investigator and scientists (the whole team) involved in\nthe project with indication of the lead scientist\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 8\nP03.

All relevant information on the specific strains (strain ID, genetic\ninformation, origin of strain) is included in this database.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nYes\nSince there is no formally acknowledged metadata standard specific to our discipline, Dublin\nCore Metadata will be used. Moreover, we will closely monitor MIBBI (Minimum Information for\nBiological and Biomedical Investigations) for metadata standards that are more specific to our\ndata.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 8\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nBiological samples: Cryotubes with strains will be stored in a -80° freezer present in the\nVerstrepen lab at KU Leuven (Gaston Geenslaan 1, Heverlee). \nCosts are covered by general lab\nexpenses.  Unauthorized people do not have access to strains.\n \n \nData (digital files) generated in this project will be stored in a Dropbox Business Advanced\naccount for processing and analyses; following secure data transfer, modern data encryption\nstandards, and encrypted block storage (256-bit AES and SSL/TLS encryption. For more details\nsee: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/business/trust\n \n \nSequencing data will be stored on an internal lab server (present in host lab) as well as on a\nsecure Dropbox Business account for processing and analyses.\n \n \nAll the relevant algorithms, scripts and software code driving the project will be stored on a\nsecure Dropbox account. Scripts used for analysis will also be stored in Jupyter notebook\n(jupyter.org - an open source web application to store and share scripts), in github or in the\nGitLab service of KU Leuven.\n \n \nUpon publication, all sequences supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via\nrepositories  such as the GenBank database or the European Nucleotide Archive (nucleotide\nsequences from primers / new genes / new genomes), the Protein Database (for protein\nsequences).\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nStrains are \nbacked up in a compressed form (96-well plates) in the Verstrepen lab and on a 2nd\nlocation (\nKasteelpark\n \nArenberg\n 20, \nHeverlee\n) at KU Leuven. Data (digital files) are automatically\nbacked up by the secure Dropbox Business Advanced account cloud backup services.\nAdditionally, project data and sequencing data will be backed up to KU Leuven servers, with\nautomatic back-up procedures.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nWe estimate the total data generated during this project to amount to around 30 Gb.\nDropbox Business offers unlimited storage and back-up capacity in their clouds.\n \nThere is sufficient storage and back-up capacity on all KU Leuven servers:\n \n- the “L-drive” is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster\nwith NetApp eseries storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front-end. \n \n- the “J-drive” is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controllers with an Ontap 9.1P9 operating\nsystem. \n \n- \nKU Leuven also offers a 2TB onedrive already included in our group’s office 365 subscription\n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nThe total estimated cost of data storage during the project is 4000 €\n. This estimation is based on\nthe following costs:\n \nYeast/bacteria strains are easily kept alive for several weeks. This costs on average 5 euro.\nWhen no experiments are planned with a specific strain, cryopreservation will thus be used\nto safeguard strains, prevent genetic drift, loss of transgene and potential contaminations. -\n80°C freezers are present in the lab of prof. Verstrepen and costs are included in general lab\ncosts. \n \nThe costs associated with a Dropbox Business account has been negotiated by the lab to 10\nUSD/month/user.\n \nThe costs of digital data storage are as follows: 173,78€/TB/Year for the “L-drive” and\n519€/TB/Year for the “J-drive”.\n \nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n5 of 8\n \nAdditional funding for storage has not been requested, therefore the costs will be covered by the\nlab’s internal budget.\n \nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nFor biological samples: \nunauthorized people do not have access to the strain collections. \n \n \nFor the digital data:\n \nA\nccess to data stored on the Dropbox Business Advanced cloud is\ngranted based on role based access control and all access requires layers of authentication\nthat includes strong passwords, SSH keys, 2 factor authentication, and one time passcodes.\nDropbox safeguards data with document watermarking, granular content permissions and\npolicies, document watermarking, and legal holds.\n \n \nBoth the “L-drive” and “J-drive” KU Leuven servers are accessible only by laboratory\nmembers, and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and\ndisaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour.\n \n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nThe minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all\ndatasets. In addition, in line with KU Leuven regulation, we will preserve the data for at least 5\nadditional years.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nAs a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing\nplatforms that support FAIR data sharing (\nwww.fairsharing.org\n), at the latest at the time of\npublication. \n \nFor all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows:\n \nBiological data: yeast and bacterial strains will be stored locally in the laboratory (-80°C).\nOther biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples as\nappropriate\n \nDigital datasets: files will be stored on Dropbox account and the KU Leuven “L-drive”.\n \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nThe total estimated cost of data storage during the 10 years after the end of the project is\nestimated to be around 8000 €. These costs will be covered from the general lab budget.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nYes. Specify:\nWe aim at communicating our results in top journals that require full disclosure of all included\ndata. Biological material will be shared upon simple request following publication, unless we\nidentify valuable IP, in which case we will first protect commercial exploitation, either through\npatenting or via an MTA that restricts the material from commercial use.\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nParticipants to the present project are committed to publish research results to communicate\nthem to peers and to a wide audience. \nAll research outputs supporting publications \nwill be made\nopenly accessible, \nunless we identify valuable IP, in which case we will first protect commercial\nexploitation, either through patenting or via an MTA that restricts the material from commercial\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n6 of 8\nuse.\n \nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn an Open Access repository\nOther (specify):\nWe aim at communicating our results in top journals that require full disclosure upon publication\nof all included data, either in the main text, in supplementary material or in a data repository if\nrequested by the journal and following deposit advice given by the journal. Depending on the\njournal, accessibility restrictions may apply.  Proper links to datasets will be provided in the\ncorresponding publications.\n \nAs a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible via existing platforms that support\nFAIR data sharing (\nwww.fairsharing.org\n). Sharing policies for specific research outputs are\ndetailed below:\nBiological data: Bacteria and yeast strains will be shared upon simple request following\npublication, unless we identify valuable IP. In this case, we will first protect commercial\nexploitation, either through patenting or via an MTA that restricts the material from\ncommercial use.\nDatasets will be deposited in open access repositories.\nResearch documentation: All protocols used to generate published data will be described in\nthe corresponding manuscript(s), and the related documentation will be included as\nsupplementary information. These data and all other documents deposited in lab notebook\nare accessible to the PI and the research staff involved in the project, and will be made\navailable upon request.\nManuscripts: We opt for open access publications where possible. Publications will be\nautomatically listed in our institutional repository, Lirias 2.0, based on the authors name and\nORCID ID.\nAlgorithms and scripts: As soon as a manuscript is publicly available, algorithms and scripts\nwill be deposited in a github repository.\nNucleic acid and protein sequences: Upon publication, all sequences supporting a\nmanuscript will be made publicly available via repositories such as the GenBank database or\nthe European Nucleotide Archive (nucleotide sequences from primers / new genes / new\ngenomes),  the Protein Database (for protein sequences).\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nAs a general rule all research outputs will be made openly accessible\n at the latest at the time of\npublication. \nNo embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, potential\nIP requirements\n – note that \npatent application\n filing w\nill be planned so that p\nublications need not\nbe delayed \n– \n \nor ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be\nmade publicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached.\n \nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nWhenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available\nthrough repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain\nsufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse, and will be conform community\nnorms. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative\nCommons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication, a Creative Commons\nAttribution (CC-BY)  or an ODC Public Domain Dedication and License, with a material transfer\nagreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly,\nand they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI.\nFor data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure\nagreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the\ntypes of reuse that are permitted.\n \nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nIt is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g.\nfor metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by\nusing free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n7 of 8\nmanagement costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. A budget for publication costs has\nbeen requested in this project.\n8. Responsibilities\nWho will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?\nMetadata will be documented by the research and technical staff involved in the project at the\ntime of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in their laboratory notebook that\nrefer to specific datasets and by ensuring detailed read me files and other documentation and\nmetadata.

It should be noted that part of the research is carried out in collaboration with TIB, more information on the agreement between KU Leuven, VIB and TIB can be found in the answer to the next question. We identify in an early phase the valorization potential of research lines and our group has a vast network of industrial contacts to efficiently start the route to commercialization. The lab is supported in this matter by Dr. Stijn Spaepen, IOF innovation manager responsible for research valorization. For research with valorization potential, the host lab actively protects its IP by filling patent applications with support from the IP department of VIB. Type of data with potential for tech transfer and valorization include yeast strains generated during the timeframe of this project (including phenotypic data), sequencing information generated during the timeframe of this project and (analysis) data and models hereof derived. Valorization potential includes a) licensing of (improved) strains or information on linking a specific sequence variant to a phenotype and b) creation or participation in start-up companies. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place? Yes Existing agreements between VIB and KU Leuven do not restrict publication of data. There is no IP on the generated strains that would prevent us from storing the strains, performing the anticipated experiments or publishing the results. It should be noted that part of the research is carried out in collaboration with TIB in China. Hence, there is a collaboration agreement in place between VIB, KU Leuven and TIB (the Chinese partner in this FWO project). This agreement stipulates the following: \"Results are owned by the Party that generated them. Each Party is entitled to valorise its own Result at its own discretion. The Parties shall not exploit or valorise jointly owned Results without first putting in place a joint ownership agreement in which Parties shall specify in which Territory and/or Field each Party take the lead for commercialization and how any renumeration of the exploitation of the Jointly Owned Results shall be shared with the other Party.\" For all strains used in this project, we will check, together with René Custers (Regulatory & Responsible Research Manager at VIB) whether we need to comply with the Nagoya protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization. In case we need to comply, we will meet certain diligence obligations under EU Regulation (EU) No 511/2014 (apply for ‘Prior Informed Consent’ document and negotiate ‘Mutually Agreed Terms” with Competent National Authority of the provider country). 4. Documentation and metadata What documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this project? Data will be generated following standardized protocols. Data will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in their (electronic) laboratory notebook. Cryotubes of biological samples (bacterial and yeast strains) stored at -80°C will be labelled with a reference number that links to an entry in our strain database. Digital data files will be stored on KU Leuven servers and will be accompanied with a READ ME text file that contains relevant metadata for understanding and re-use of data. The READ ME file will be structured as follows: PROJECT INFORMATION P01. Project name/nickname, including name of funder, type of grant, grant number P02. Name and contact of the Principal Investigator and scientists (the whole team) involved in the project with indication of the lead scientist This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 3 of 8 P03.

This dataset is related to… (documents, dataset) Cryotubes and plates with biological strains are labeled with a reference number that links to an entry in our strain database (stored on both a professional Dropbox account as well as KU Leuven servers, see also below). All relevant information on the specific strains (strain ID, genetic information, origin of strain) is included in this database. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used. If no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse. Yes Since there is no formally acknowledged metadata standard specific to our discipline, Dublin Core Metadata will be used. Moreover, we will closely monitor MIBBI (Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations) for metadata standards that are more specific to our data. This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 4 of 8 5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project Where will the data be stored? Biological samples: Cryotubes with strains will be stored in a -80° freezer present in the Verstrepen lab at KU Leuven (Gaston Geenslaan 1, Heverlee). Costs are covered by general lab expenses. Unauthorized people do not have access to strains. Data (digital files) generated in this project will be stored in a Dropbox Business Advanced account for processing and analyses; following secure data transfer, modern data encryption standards, and encrypted block storage (256-bit AES and SSL/TLS encryption. For more details see: https://www.dropbox.com/business/trust Sequencing data will be stored on an internal lab server (present in host lab) as well as on a secure Dropbox Business account for processing and analyses. All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software code driving the project will be stored on a secure Dropbox account. Scripts used for analysis will also be stored in Jupyter notebook (jupyter.org - an open source web application to store and share scripts), in github or in the GitLab service of KU Leuven. Upon publication, all sequences supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via repositories such as the GenBank database or the European Nucleotide Archive (nucleotide sequences from primers / new genes / new genomes), the Protein Database (for protein sequences). How is backup of the data provided? Strains are backed up in a compressed form (96-well plates) in the Verstrepen lab and on a 2nd location ( Kasteelpark Arenberg 20, Heverlee ) at KU Leuven. Data (digital files) are automatically backed up by the secure Dropbox Business Advanced account cloud backup services. Additionally, project data and sequencing data will be backed up to KU Leuven servers, with automatic back-up procedures. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes We estimate the total data generated during this project to amount to around 30 Gb. Dropbox Business offers unlimited storage and back-up capacity in their clouds. There is sufficient storage and back-up capacity on all KU Leuven servers: - the “L-drive” is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster with NetApp eseries storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front-end. - the “J-drive” is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controllers with an Ontap 9.1P9 operating system. - KU Leuven also offers a 2TB onedrive already included in our group’s office 365 subscription What are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these costs be covered? The total estimated cost of data storage during the project is 4000 € . This estimation is based on the following costs: Yeast/bacteria strains are easily kept alive for several weeks. This costs on average 5 euro. When no experiments are planned with a specific strain, cryopreservation will thus be used to safeguard strains, prevent genetic drift, loss of transgene and potential contaminations. - 80°C freezers are present in the lab of prof. Verstrepen and costs are included in general lab costs. The costs associated with a Dropbox Business account has been negotiated by the lab to 10 USD/month/user. The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 173,78€/TB/Year for the “L-drive” and 519€/TB/Year for the “J-drive”. This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 5 of 8 Additional funding for storage has not been requested, therefore the costs will be covered by the lab’s internal budget. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? For biological samples: unauthorized people do not have access to the strain collections. For the digital data: A ccess to data stored on the Dropbox Business Advanced cloud is granted based on role based access control and all access requires layers of authentication that includes strong passwords, SSH keys, 2 factor authentication, and one time passcodes. Dropbox safeguards data with document watermarking, granular content permissions and policies, document watermarking, and legal holds. Both the “L-drive” and “J-drive” KU Leuven servers are accessible only by laboratory members, and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. 6. Data preservation after the FWO project Which data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...). The minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets. In addition, in line with KU Leuven regulation, we will preserve the data for at least 5 additional years. Where will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)? As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing ( www.fairsharing.org ), at the latest at the time of publication. For all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows: Biological data: yeast and bacterial strains will be stored locally in the laboratory (-80°C). Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples as appropriate Digital datasets: files will be stored on Dropbox account and the KU Leuven “L-drive”. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered? The total estimated cost of data storage during the 10 years after the end of the project is estimated to be around 8000 €. These costs will be covered from the general lab budget. 7. Data sharing and reuse Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Yes. Specify: We aim at communicating our results in top journals that require full disclosure of all included data. Biological material will be shared upon simple request following publication, unless we identify valuable IP, in which case we will first protect commercial exploitation, either through patenting or via an MTA that restricts the material from commercial use. Which data will be made available after the end of the project? Participants to the present project are committed to publish research results to communicate them to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made openly accessible, unless we identify valuable IP, in which case we will first protect commercial exploitation, either through patenting or via an MTA that restricts the material from commercial This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 6 of 8 use. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? In an Open Access repository Other (specify): We aim at communicating our results in top journals that require full disclosure upon publication of all included data, either in the main text, in supplementary material or in a data repository if requested by the journal and following deposit advice given by the journal. Depending on the journal, accessibility restrictions may apply. Proper links to datasets will be provided in the corresponding publications. As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing ( www.fairsharing.org ). Sharing policies for specific research outputs are detailed below: Biological data: Bacteria and yeast strains will be shared upon simple request following publication, unless we identify valuable IP. In this case, we will first protect commercial exploitation, either through patenting or via an MTA that restricts the material from commercial use. Datasets will be deposited in open access repositories. Research documentation: All protocols used to generate published data will be described in the corresponding manuscript(s), and the related documentation will be included as supplementary information. These data and all other documents deposited in lab notebook are accessible to the PI and the research staff involved in the project, and will be made available upon request. Manuscripts: We opt for open access publications where possible. Publications will be automatically listed in our institutional repository, Lirias 2.0, based on the authors name and ORCID ID. Algorithms and scripts: As soon as a manuscript is publicly available, algorithms and scripts will be deposited in a github repository. Nucleic acid and protein sequences: Upon publication, all sequences supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via repositories such as the GenBank database or the European Nucleotide Archive (nucleotide sequences from primers / new genes / new genomes), the Protein Database (for protein sequences). When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results As a general rule all research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at the time of publication. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, potential IP requirements – note that patent application filing w ill be planned so that p ublications need not be delayed – or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be made publicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse, and will be conform community norms. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication, a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) or an ODC Public Domain Dedication and License, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered? It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 7 of 8 management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. A budget for publication costs has been requested in this project. 8. Responsibilities Who will be responsible for data documentation & metadata? Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff involved in the project at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in their laboratory notebook that refer to specific datasets and by ensuring detailed read me files and other documentation and metadata.
