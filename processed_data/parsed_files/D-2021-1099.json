Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add\nthe reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for Research and Public\nService Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering the fact that you process\npersonal data is a legal obligation.\nYes\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 4\nPrivacy Registry Reference:\nG-2022-4817\nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used: (1) demographic information (age,\ngender, ethnicity, marital status), (2) Questionnaire measures including depressive symptoms, social\nnetworks, interpersonal behavior and problems, (3) Behavioral data generated during mobile cognitive\ntasks (i.e. endorsement ratings), (4) Mobile sensor data (phone logs, GPS, Bluetooth), (5) Momentary\nassessment measures including mood states, social stress, and social behavior, and (6) Participant\nobservation notes created by the research team.\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments\non humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the\nrelevant ethical review committee(s)\nYes\nEthical approval has been resquested at the SOCIAL AND SOCIETAL ETHICS COMMITTEE.\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and\nwhich restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you\n(re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this\nproject?\nFor each study, we will create a separate folder that contains the following information:\n1. Read me.docx: In this word-document, we will discuss which researchers were involved in the\ncollection of the data (e.g., master students, contact persons from psychiatric hospitals, etc.), the ethical\napproval (reference number & institution), a short overview of the study course and protocol, which\nquestionnaires we administered and their variable labels, and short written information on the data\ncleaning process and steps.\n2. Codebook.xlsx: In this excel-document, we will provide pseudonymized baseline information about all\nparticipants that were enrolled in the study (e.g., age, gender, native language, which phases of the\nstudy they completed and when, whether they completed the entire study or dropped-out, their\ncompliance, other remarks, etc.). We also provide specific information about the questionnaires we\nadministered (i.e., number of items, reference, their variable labels, ranges and description). Finally, we\nprovide some basic summary statistics (e.g., gender and age distribution, number of participants per\ncondition, overall study compliance, etc.).\n3. Folder with all the study documents: Ethical application and approval, informed consent example, the\ninstructions we gave participants. The PDF of all questionnaires (both baseline and ESM) will be included.\n4. Pre-processing documents: The raw data (pseudonymized), a reproducible syntax / code to clean the\ndata in to .xlsx files that are ready for data-analysis.\nThe folder will never contain sensitive (identifiable) participants information such as names, contact\ndetails, etc.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be used. \nIf no,\nstate in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nThe meta-data will consist of a Read me.docx, Codebook.xlsx, syntax to process the raw data into files\nthat are ready for analysis, and a folder with all the study documents (e.g., Informed consent, ethical\napproval, etc.) to further contextualize the collection of the data underlying our publications. See\nprevious question for more detailed information.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nPersonal information, baseline, ESM surveys, and sensor data will be stored with a unique participant\nnumber, ensuring pseudonymization.\nRestricted and sensitive data (e.g. personal information, contact information, the informed consent, etc.)\nwill be stored separately on an encrypted password-protected personal I-drive of the KU Leuven for the\nduration of this project, and can only be accessed by the main researchers of this project.\nData from surveys, experience sampling, and mobile sensors will be pseudonymized via this participant\nnumber and securely stored on a shared and encrypted network J-drive, and is only accessible to involved\nresearchers using their employee ID. Both drives are backed-up automatically to prevent loss of data.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 4\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe data will be stored on the KU Leuven central servers with automatic daily back-up procedures.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify\nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how\nthis will be taken care of.\nYes\nKU leuven storage drives have sufficient capacity. Therefore we do not anticipate insufficient storage or\nbackup limitations.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these\ncosts be covered?\nNo costs are expected.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or\nmodified by unauthorized persons?\nBoth the I-drive and J-drive are fully encrypted and password-protected (only accessible to involved\nresearchers using their employee ID).\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In\ncase only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this\n(legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAfter data collection is finished for a study, all identifiable information will be deleted (i.e., participants'\nnames, contact details, bank account, etc.) because this information will no longer be relevant or required\nfor study purposes. All other information will be retained for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven\nRDM policy.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for at\nleast 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years?\nHow will the costs be covered?\nAll datasets will be archived on the servers of KU Leuven. Possible expenses to host these servers are\nalways covered by the research group, but are expected to fall within normal cost ranges (based on the\nvolume of the datafiles).\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as\ndefined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nNo\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nThe full pseudonymized dataset will be available for colleague researchers for meta-analytic projects\nupon request (and signing a data-sharing agreement). For reviewers and readers of our published articles\na trimmed and pseudonymized dataset (i.e., only containing the variables required to reproduce our\nresults) will be uploaded in a .csv or .xlsx format to the Open Science Framework under a CC-BY license\nalongside full dataset documentation. Participants' personal information (e.g., contact information,\nnames, etc.) or audio files will never be shared.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nFor meta-analytic projects researchers can request the full pseudonymized dataset via email, and will\nreceive these after signing a data-sharing agreement.\nFor published papers, a trimmed and pseudonymized dataset (i.e., only containing the variables required\nto reproduce our results) will be uploaded in a .csv or .xlsx format to the Open Science Framework under\na CC-BY license alongside full dataset documentation.\nParticipants' personal information (e.g., contact information, names, etc.) or audio files will never be\nshared.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nA trimmed and pseudonymized dataset (i.e., only containing the variables required to reproduce our\nresults) will be uploaded in a .csv or .xlsx format to the Open Science Framework under a CC-BY license\nalongside full dataset documentation at the time of submitting a related manuscript to a journal.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 4\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nThe trimmed dataset will be uploaded in a .csv format at the Opens Science Framework as an open\naccess dataset under a CC-BY license.
