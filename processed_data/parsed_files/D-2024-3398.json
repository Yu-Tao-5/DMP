The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but\nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.\nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 1\n1.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Arne Bouillon (ORCID ID 0000-0002-2745-1982)\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Supervisors: Giovanni Samaey (ORCID ID 0000-0001-8433-4523 ) and Dirk Nuyens (ORCID ID 0000-0002-\n4555-2314)\nProject number1 & title Design and analysis of multilevel interacting-particle methods with surrogate models for efficient Bayesian \ninversion\nFunder(s) GrantID2Funded by a Fundamental Research predoctoral mandate ( 1169725N) by FWO\nAffiliation(s) KU Leuven\nPlease provide a short project description We propose three main contributions. First, we extend our recent multilevel methods, which \ncombine models at different fidelity levels. We will add a resampling step and rigorously analyse \nthe non-asymptotic behaviour of these algorithms.
