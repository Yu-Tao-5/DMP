Gamma and alpha oscillations are associated with memory and vision,\nwhile some brain diseases are treated by disrupting pathological oscillations. A neuromodulation technology to control neural oscillations in a safe,\nspatially precise and non-invasive way would have great potential as a research tool for cognitive neuroscientists and as a therapeutic tool for\nclinicians. Low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound (TUS) is a non-invasive technology that uses high-frequency sound to stimulate the brain.\nStudies show TUS is safe in humans and may have a range of neuromodulatory effects. However, TUS is an emerging technology. Its full potential,\nworking mechanisms and optimal parameters have yet to be discovered. Here, we will use a rat model to develop a novel TUS approach for controlling\nneural oscillations – oscillatory TUS (o-TUS). We will use cutting edge high-density neural probes to characterize the TUS mechanism. We will then\ntranslate o-TUS to humans and use it to manipulate alpha oscillations in visual cortex in healthy volunteers. The electrophysiological effects of o-TUS\nin humans will be quantified via EEG. Finally, o-TUS will be used to modulate visual perception. Thus, this project will develop and translate a novel\napproach for using TUS to control neural oscillations and provide new mechanistic insight. If successful, o-TUS will have wide impact on cognitive\nand clinical neuroscience.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n08-07-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? To store the data on the L-drive, the cost is 500 euro for 5 TB a year. So to store more or less 5 TB for 5 years, 2500 euro costs are expected. The PI (Myles Mc Laughlin) will cover this. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 08 July 2024 8 of 10 5.
