But, as a chrY-specific sequencing panel did not exist, it has not been\nlinked to a genealogical database yet. During my PhD, I developed the first chrY-specific\nsequencing panel, the CSYseq, providing a large dataset of 15,813 interesting Y-markers. This\nCSYseq is useful to determine evolutionary biogeographical ancestry and to identify close\npaternal kinships. In this postdoctoral project, I aim to reveal the genetics behind historical socio-\ndemography in Flanders through chrY analysis. It is my ambition to provide novel and valuable\nperspectives across three disciplines: historical demography, evolutionary biology and forensic\ngenetics. I will sequence 450 males linked to the unique socio-demographical COR* database,\nwhich is representative for the Flemish population. Through this interdisciplinary genetic-\ngenealogical approach, I will (a) explore surname founder history to gather more perceptions on\nsurname origins, (b) unravel the influence of chrY and demographic variability on offspring\ngender ratio, and (c) determine human chrY diversity to estimate familial searching success\nrates. The key deliverable is a genetic-genealogical database, linking a universally exchangeable\nchrY dataset with extensive socio-demographic data. Overall, this pioneer study will increase the\nimportance of the highly underused chrY for interdisciplinary population research worldwide.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
