The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Hongbo Yuan, 0000-0002-4250-195X\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles\nProject number1 & title 98133, Smart hydrogels for optically mapping forces in 3D cancer models\nFunder(s) GrantID2Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (FWO), 12A2423N\nAffiliation(s)  KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nProvide ROR3 identifier when possible:  \nPlease provide a short project description   ,    -       In this project I will develop mechano responsive hydrogels combining PIC polymers with\n-   ,           DNA based force modules which can optically report and control cellular forces and fiber\n .         ,    remodeling process By using fibroblasts and cancer cells as model cells we will study the  \n             role of cellular forces and force propagation in fibroblast activation and cancer cell\n.            interactions The methods and materials developed will allow researchers to study how\n    ,        ,    cellular forces affect the matrix how far do they propagate within the matrix and how are\n        ,   ,  3 .  forces transmitted from the matrix to the distant cell with subcellular resolution in D The\n            -   insights acquired will allow us to shed light on the role of fibroblast induced mechanical\n   .cues in cancer propagation\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

All data is transfered via encrypted methods. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All data will be retained for the expected 5-year period after the end of the project. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?The data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for at least 5 years after the end of project, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?The research unit has already invested in short-term and mid-term procuring storage devices and space for data. For long-term data storage till 5 years after the end of the project, we will use the service provided by the institution, which costs approx. 700 Euros yearly, which requests about 3500 Euros for support from the grant. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 116. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, in an Open Access repository After the end of project, the data produced in this project will be made usable by third parties via open- access publications and shared depository of relevant data upon requests. ☐ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.We will deposit the data in our institutional repository, eg. Lirias: https://lirias2.kuleuven.be/default.html FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.Upon publication of the research results Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 Data from the project that can be shared will be made available under a creative commons attribution license (cc-by 4.0), so that users have to give credit to the original data creators. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes: A DOI will be available through RDR, but is not yet available. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? RDR is free for KU Leuven personnel, hence, no costs are expected for data sharing. 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 137.
