The\nchallenging task of developing such materials requires reliable predictive simulation tools to complement time and cost expen-\nsive experimental characterization. With High-Performance Solvers for Multi-Physics Materials Simulations (HyPerMatSim)\nwe propose to improve numerical robustness and performance of DAMASK1, an established open source crystal plasticity and\nmulti-physics simulation toolbox, by developing and implementing novel numerical solvers based on the fast Fourier transform\n(FFT). The combination of state of the art numerical methods for solving partial differential equations with millions of un-\nknowns in a memory- and resource-efficient way with physics-based constitutive models for plasticity, fracture, temperature,\nand chemical processes enables predicting the behavior of complex materials.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n31-12-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
