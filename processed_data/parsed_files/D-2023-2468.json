But\nhow does an unpaid donation system compare to a paid system? This research project studies the economic and ethical\naspects of blood commodification that occurs when blood donors are paid. A literature review summarizes the moral\narguments for and against selling blood, behavioral economics models about the influence of material incentives on\naltruism, surveys on the acceptability of donor payments, and existing observational studies and field experiments\nabout the consequences of donor payments on blood supply quantity and quality. The latter studies will be integrated in\na meta-analysis to estimate the cost-effectiveness of blood donor payments. New surveys and field experiments, as well\nas existing observational data of the Flemish Red Cross, will be used to provide further empirical evidence of the harms\nand benefits of blood commodification on donors, patients and the rest of society.\nLast modified: \n13-12-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
