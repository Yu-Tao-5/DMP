Nonetheless, its medieval Fortleben has\nreceived less attention than it deserves. By providing the first encompassing study of its\nreception and manuscript transmission in the abovementioned timespan, I will clarify the role of\nDe civitate Dei in the genesis of medieval theological, ecclesiological, and political theories.\nMoreover, I will shed new light on the reuse of Augustinian authority in different contexts and for\ndifferent - and sometimes, opposite - purposes. The project combines (1) a horizontal line of\ninquiry, which involves mapping and describing the quotations from De civitate Dei and its\nmanuscript witnesses, with (2) a vertical perspective, which entails an in-depth examination of\nselect clusters of works. These are (a) the Libelli de lite Imperatorum et Pontificum, produced in\nthe context of the Investiture Controversy, aimed at endorsing or opposing the so-called\nGregorian Church reform, and (b) the works that took a stance in the controversy over the\nEucharistic dogma. This combination will enable me to assess the dissemination of De civitate\nDei in the High Middle Ages from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
