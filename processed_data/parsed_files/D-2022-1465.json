The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\n1.General Information\nName applicant Adrian Ranga\nFWO Project Number & Title Actuoids: Bioengineering the Neural Tube with Soft Actuation\nG086622N\nAffiliation ☒ KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent\n☐ Universiteit Hasselt  \n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel\n☐ Other: \n2.Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make  \nuse of existing data?  ☒ Generate new data\n☐ Reuse existing data\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 2Describe the origin, type and format of the data \n(per dataset) and its (estimated) volume\nIf you reuse existing data, specify the source of these \ndata. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from \ndata formats (the technical format).The data types collected will involve mainly microscopy-acquired images, and numerical databases\n(eg. Excel) with results and analysis. Additionally, computer programs for data analysis such as in\nMatlab and R will be generated. Final outcome of this research will be in the format of Word\ndocuments, Powerpoint slides and Adobe Illustrator figures. We are currently collaborating with the\ngroup of Stein Aerts for the secure preservation of our scRNAseq data.\n3.Ethical and legal issues\nWill you use personal data? If so, shortly describe  \nthe kind of personal data you will use AND add  \nthe  reference  to  your  file  in  your  host  \ninstitution's privacy register.\nIn case your host institution does not (yet) have a  \nprivacy register, a reference is not yet required of  \ncourse; please add the reference once the privacy  \nregister is in place in your host institution.☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes: \n-Privacy Registry Reference:\n-Short description of the kind of personal data that will be used:\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the \ncreation and/or use of the data (e.g. \nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If  \nso, add the reference to the formal approval by \nthe relevant ethical review committee(s).☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes: \n-Reference to ethical committee approval:\nDoes your work possibly result in research data  \nwith potential for tech transfer and valorisation?  \nWill IP restrictions be claimed for the data you  \ncreated?  If  so,  for  what  data  and  which  \nrestrictions will be asserted?☒ Yes\n☐ No\nIf yes, please comment: Some of the technologies for actuating organoids, as described in the proposal, \nmay be protected through patent applications. This will be done with the help of KU Leuven LRD, prior to \nsubmission of work for publication. Submission for IP protection is not expected to delay publication of the  \nwork. \n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 3Do  existing  3rd party  agreements  restrict  \ndissemination  or  exploitation  of  the  data  you  \n(re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and  \nwhat restrictions are in place?☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes, please comment:\n4.Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable \nunderstanding and reuse of the data \ncollected/generated in this project?  All files stored on the NAS are time-stamped and stored by user. Documentation is provided in the form of \ndata inventories per project, also stored on the NAS.  \nscRNAseq data is uploaded to GEO and referenced in publications.  \nPrimary data and source code is referenced in electronic notebooks.  \n  \nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be used.  If  \nnot, state in detail which metadata will be \ncreated to make the data easy/easier to find \nand reuse.☒ Yes\n☐ No\nIf yes, please specify: Metadata for files uploaded to NAS will be automatically generated and will be \ncentrally managed by myself (Ranga) and senior postdoc involved in this project.  \n5.Data storage & backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?   We have currently implemented a system whereby data is stored in a network attached storage (NAS), a \nspecialized computer dedicated to file storage, on 2 fast 8TB HDDS drives which store data in parallel in \nmirrored configuration.  \nControl is done via web interface, implementing multiple backup and replication strategies, including \nreplication of data to cloud storage. Besides data storage  the NAS also implements major types of \ncollaborative activities, like document or spreadsheet editing, calendars, notes and todo lists.\nHow will the data be backed up?  See above\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 4Is there currently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.  ☒ Yes\n☐ No\nIf no, please specify: see above. The NAS is easily upgraded to multiple drives should the need arise.  \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the project? How will these \ncosts be covered? \nAlthough FWO has no earmarked budget at its \ndisposal to support correct research data \nmanagement, FWO allows for part of the allocated \nproject budget to be used to cover the cost incurred.The NAS is purchased and will not require additional costs at the moment. Budget for extending storage \ncapacities physically or cloud-based will be incorporated into the equipment part of this FWO budget, in \ncombination with other project budgets which would require additional storage, as needs arise.  \nData security: how will you ensure that the data \nare securely stored and not accessed or \nmodified by unauthorized persons?  Data stored on NAS is read-only and version control is implemented.  \n6.Data preservation after the end of the FWO project\nFWO expects that data generated during the project are retained for a period of minimally 5 years after the end of the project, in as far as legal and  \ncontractual agreements allow.\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 \nyear period after the end of the project? In case \nonly a selection of the data can/will be \npreserved, clearly state the reasons  for this \n(legal or contractual restrictions, physical \npreservation issues, ...).All generated data used in publications is planned to be stored for 5 years after end of the project. Primary  \ndata from experiments which have failed or are not used for publication will be deleted in consultation \nwith PI. \nWhere will these data be archived (= stored for \nthe long term)? Data will be archived on the NAS (see above).\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 5What are the expected costs for data \npreservation during these 5 years?

Additional drives for archival storage at the end of the \nproject may be required and costs (few hundred euros) will be reserved on equipment budget of the \nproject for the end of the project for this purpose.  \n7.Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing \nthe sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as \ndefined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal \nrestrictions)? ☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes, please specify:\nWhich data will be made available after the end \nof the project?
