The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal.

If so, shortly describe  \nthe kind of personal data you will use AND add  \nthe  reference  to  your  file  in  your  host  \ninstitution's privacy register.\nIn case your host institution does not (yet) have a  \nprivacy register, a reference is not yet required of  \ncourse; please add the reference once the privacy  \nregister is in place in your host institution.☐ No\nIf yes: \n-Privacy Registry Reference:\n-Short description of the kind of personal data that will be used:\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the \ncreation and/or use of the data (e.g. \nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)?
