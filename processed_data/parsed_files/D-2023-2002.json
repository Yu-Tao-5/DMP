The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Jelle Vermandere: 0000-0002-7809-9798\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles\nProject number1 & title  \nFunder(s) GrantID2 1S16923N\nAffiliation(s) KU Leuven \nPlease provide a short project descriptionThe lack of accurate and up-to-date digital information of built assets is devastating to the AECO industry. It leads to improper \ndesign, costly in-situ changes and failure costs that can all be easily avoided with accurate digital built environments. \nSimultaneously, eXtended Reality (XR) technologies are becoming increasingly widespread to improve worker efficiency, \ninspections and so on. In this project, we propose to take XR to the next level and also deploy it to dynamically map, track changes  \nand interact with the built environment. Specifically, we will (1) align XR measurements with pre-recordings of a site to establish an  \nup-to-date documentation, (2) interpret the resulting remote sensing data to produce meaningful geometries and textures of built \nenvironments and (3) bring these digitized assets to the site so operators can use the accurate digitized environments in various \nAECO applications. A key innovation of this project is the harnessing of generative shape modeling that will –for the first time ever-  \nallow the reality modeling of both seen and unseen AECO objects. The outcomes of this project will keep AECO facilities better up \nto date and improve information access. Furthermore, it will increase worker productivity and make real-world processes safer \nsince the workers can simulate/train applications with XR on site.\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number. This question is optional since not every institution has an internal project number different from the GrantID. Applicants can \nonly provide one project number.  2 Funder(s) GrantID refers to the number of the DMP at the funder(s), here one can specify multiple GrantIDs if multiple funding sources were used.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 32.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.
