If  so, \nfor  what  data \nand  which \nrestrictions  will \nbe asserted?□ No\nX Yes\nI do not exclude that the proposed work could result in research data  \nwith potential for tech transfer and valorization. The KU Leuven has a  \npolicy to actively monitor research data for such potential. If there is  \nsubstantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a  \nnumber  of  cases  the  invention  will  be  IP  protected  (mostly  patent  \nprotection or copyright protection). As such the IP protection does not  \nwithhold  the  research  data  from  being  made  public.  In  the  case  a  \ndecision is taken to file a patent application it will be planned so that  \npublications need not be delayed.\nDo  existing  3rd \nparty \nagreements \nrestrict \ndissemination or \nexploitation  of \nthe  data  you \n(re)use? If so, to \nwhat  data  do \nthey  relate  and \nwhat restrictions \nare in place?X No\n□ Yes\nNo third-party agreement restricts dissemination or exploitation of the  \ndata from this project. \n3.Documentation and metadata\nWhat \ndocumentation \nwill be provided \nto  enable \nunderstanding \nand reuse of the \ndata \ncollected/gener\nated  in  this \nproject? Documentation  will  consist  of  notes  in  the  electronic  laboratory  \nnotebook (E-notebook) that refer to specific datasets.  Those notes will  \ndescribe the biological samples used, experimental setup and protocols  \nused, sequences generated, the links to the specific computer location as  \nwell as the names of the respective datasets. \nI will also maintain a metadata sheet with the connection between lab  \nsamples and files on our data storage, so that data files, lab samples, and  \nexperimental notes remain properly linked.\nAlgorithms, scripts and software usage will be documented, e.g. using  \nJupyter Notebooks. When scripts, algorithms and software tools are  \nfinalized,  they  will  be  additionally  described  in  manuscripts  and  on  \nGitHub (see www.github.com/pasque  lab   for our previous datasets and  \nscripts).\nDMP for 1170722N\n6\nWill a metadata \nstandard  be \nused?  If  so, \ndescribe  in \ndetail  which \nstandard will be \nused.   If  not, \nstate  in  detail \nwhich metadata \nwill  be  created \nto  make  the \ndata easy/easier \nto  find  and \nreuse.□ No\nX Yes\nSequencing  data  types  require  particular  metadata,  such  as  data  \nsubmitted to EGA, GEO, SRA, ArrayExpress, or ENA. Local data that is not  \n(yet)  submitted  to  these  resources  will  be  based  on  generalized  \nmetadata  schema  such  as  Dublin  Core  or  DataCite,  including  the  \nfollowing elements:\n• Title: free text\n• Creator: Last name, first name, organization\n• Date and time reference\n• Subject: Choice of keywords and classifications\n• Description: Text explaining the content of the data set and other  \ncontextual information needed for the correct interpretation of the data,  \nthe software(s) (including version number) used to produce and to read  \nthe data, the purpose of the experiment, etc.\n• Format: Details of the file format,\n• Resource Type: data set, image, audio, etc.\n• Identifier: DOI (when applicable)\n• Access rights: closed access, embargoed access, restricted access, open  \naccess.\nWhen depositing data in a local or public repository, the final dataset will  \nbe accompanied by this information under the form of a README.txt  \ndocument. This file will be located in the top level directory of the  \ndataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the  \nfile-naming convention used (see section 7 below). This will allow the  \ndata to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add  \ncontextual value to the dataset for future reuse.\nDMP for 1170722N\n7\n4.Data storage & backup during the FWO project\nWhere  will  the \ndata be stored? Digital files will be stored on KU Leuven servers.  \n-Omics data: omics data generated during the project will either  \nbe stored on KU Leuven servers or on the Flemish Supercomputer  \nCentre (VSC), initially in the staging + archive area and later only  \nin the archive area (archive is mirrored).\n-Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained  \nclones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of  \npurified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock  \n(-80°C). All published vectors and the associated sequences will  \nbe sent to the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will  \ntake care of vector storage and shipping upon request.\n-Algorithms,  scripts and software: All the  relevant algorithms,  \nscripts and software code driving the project will be stored in  \nprivate  online  git  repositories  of  the  PI  (e.g.,  \n.https://github.com/pasquelab).  As  soon  as  the  manuscript  is  \npublicly available,  the repository will be changed to  a public  \nrepository.\n-Nucleic acid and protein sequences: All nucleic acid and protein  \nsequences generated during the project will be stored on KU  \nLeuven servers. Upon publication, all sequences supporting a  \nmanuscript will be made publicly available via repositories  such  \nas the GenBank database or the European Nucleotide Archive  \n(nucleotide  sequences  from  primers  /  new  genes  /  new  \ngenomes), NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (microarray data /  \nRNA-seq data / CHIPseq data), the Protein Database (for protein  \nsequences), the EBI European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA)  \nfor  personally  identifiable  (epi)genome  and  transcriptome  \nsequences.\n-Other data files (Digital images, cytometry data, etc..) will be  \nstored on local KU Leuven servers and PI computers.\nHow  will  the \ndata  be  backed \nup? KU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme:\n-  data  stored  on  the  “L-drive”  is  backed  up  daily  using  snapshot  \ntechnology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous  \nversion are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept.  \n- data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at  \nmidnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in  \neach case the last 6 backups are kept.\n- All omics data stored on the Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC) will \nbe transferred on a monthly basis to the archive area which is mirrored.\nDMP for 1170722N\n8\nIs  there \ncurrently \nsufficient \nstorage  & \nbackup  capacity \nduring  the \nproject?  If  yes, \nspecify \nconcisely.  If  no \nor  insufficient \nstorage  or \nbackup \ncapacities  are \navailable,  then \nexplain how this \nwill  be  taken \ncare of. □ No\nX Yes\nThere is sufficient storage and back-up capacity on all KU Leuven servers:\n- the “L-drive” is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File  \nSystem (GPFS) cluster with NetApp series storage systems, and a CTDB  \nsamba cluster in the front-end. \n- the “J-drive” is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controllers with  \nan Ontap 9.1P9 operating system. \n- the Staging and Archive on VSC are also sufficiently scalable (petabyte  \nscale)\nWhat  are  the \nexpected  costs \nfor data storage \nand  backup \nduring  the \nproject?  How \nwill  these  costs \nbe covered? The total estimated cost of data storage during the project is ˜9,000 EUR.  \nThis estimation is based on the following costs:\n-The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 128,39€/TB/Year  \nfor the “L-drive” and 519EUR/TB/Year for the “J-drive”.\n-The  cost  of  VSC  archive  is  70  EUR/TB/Year,  and  staging  \n130EUR/TB/Year.\n-We expect costs to drop slightly during the coming four years.  \nAdditional budget for compute and data storage is budgeted for  \nin ongoing projects, and will be costed in complementary project  \napplications.\nData  security: \nhow  will  you \nensure  that  the \ndata  are \nsecurely  stored \nand  not \naccessed  or \nmodified  by \nunauthorized \npersons? -The  “L-drive”  and  “J-drive”  servers  are  accessible  only  by  \nlaboratory  members  and  are  mirrored  in  the  second  ICTS  \ndatacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a  \ncopy of the data can be recovered within an hour.\n-The  VSC  storage  is  only  accessible  to  VSC  accounts,  and  \nspecifically our volume is only accessible to group members.  \n-No personal data will be stored on the VSC nor local servers.\nDMP for 1170722N\n9\n5.Data preservation after the end of the FWO project\nKU Leuven expects that data generated during the project are retained for a period  \nof minimally 5 years after the end of the project, in as far as legal and contractual  \nagreements allow.\nWhich  data  will \nbe  retained  for \nthe  expected  5 \nyear period after \nthe  end  of  the \nproject? In case \nonly  a  selection \nof  the  data \ncan/will  be \npreserved, \nclearly state the \nreasons  for this \n(legal  or \ncontractual \nrestrictions, \nphysical \npreservation \nissues, ...).The minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project  \nwill be applied to all datasets.\nWhere will these \ndata be archived \n(= stored for the \nlong term)? As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever  \npossible  via  existing  platforms  that  support  FAIR  data  sharing  \n(www.fairsharing.org ), at the latest at the time of publication or preprint  \ndeposition. \nFor all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows:\n-Large sequencing/omics data: will be stored on VSC archive\n-Small digital files: files will be stored on the “L-drive”.\n-Developed algorithms and software will be stored on VSC archive  \nand/or L-drive, as well on public repositories such as Github.com.\n-Third-party software and algorithms that are used are referenced by  \ntheir  version  numbers  (e.g.,  in  our  Jupyter  notebooks),  and  are  \ninstalled  as  modules  on  the  VSC  and/or  containers  (Docker,  \nSingularity) on the VSC, to ensure reproducibility.  \nDMP for 1170722N\n10\nWhat  are  the \nexpected  costs \nfor  data \npreservation \nduring  these  5 \nyears? How will \nthe  costs  be \ncovered? The total estimated cost of data storage during the 5 years after the end  \nof the is 2,500 EUR. This estimation is based on 70EUR/Tb/year. The  \nstorage after the project is much smaller because during the project a  \nlarge working space is needed, and post-publication data will be made  \naccessible via open access platforms.\nThe costs for this data preservation will be upfront paid for from this  \nFWO project \n6.Data sharing and reuse\nAre  there \nany  factors \nrestricting or \npreventing \nthe  sharing \nof  (some  of) \nthe data (e.g. \nas defined in \nan \nagreement \nwith  a  3rd \nparty,  legal \nrestrictions)? X No\n□ Yes\n \nWhich  data \nwill be made \navailable \nafter the end \nof  the \nproject? The PI in the present project is committed to publish research results to  \ncommunicate them to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs  \nsupporting publications will be made openly accessible. Depending on their  \nnature, some data may be made available prior to publication, either on an  \nindividual  basis  to  interested  researchers  and/or  potential  new  \ncollaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. negative data).\nDMP for 1170722N\n11\nWhere/how \nwill the data \nbe  made \navailable  for \nreuse? X In an Open Access repository\nX In a restricted access repository\n□  Upon request by mail\nX  Other  (specify):  open-access  publications  in  peer-reviewed  journals,  \nincluding supplemental information\nAs a general rule,  datasets will be  made openly accessible via existing  \nplatforms that support FAIR data sharing ( www.fairsharing.org ). Sharing \npolicies for specific research outputs are detailed below:\n-Omics datasets will be deposited in open access repositories such as  \nthe EMBL-EBI platform for genomics and epigenomics data, or the  \nNCBI  Gene  Expression  Omnibus  (GEO),  the  EBI  ArrayExpress  \ndatabases  for  functional  genomics  data  or  the  EBI  European  \nGenome-phenome Archive (EGA) for personally identifiable genetic  \nand phenotypic data. Data at EGA will be collected from individuals  \nwhose consent agreements authorise data release only for specific  \nresearch use to bona fide researchers. \n-Other digital datasets that support publications (including image,  \ncytometry data, and simulation data) will be made publicly available  \nvia  an  open  research  data  platform  such  as  Mendeley  Data  or  \nZenodo.\n-Research documentation: All protocols used to generate published  \ndata will be described in the corresponding manuscript(s), and the  \nrelated  documentation  will  be  included  as  supplementary  \ninformation. These data and all other documents (daily logs, raw  \ndata) deposited in the E-Notebook are accessible to the PI and the  \nresearch staff, and will be made available upon request.\n-Manuscripts:  All  scientific  publications  will  be  shared  openly.  \nManuscripts submitted for publication will be deposited in a pre-\nprint server such as bioRxiv, arXiv, Nature Precedings or ASAPbio). At  \nthe time of publication, research results will be summarized on the  \nPI’s  website  (http://www.kuleuven.be/pasquelab )  and  post-print \npdf versions of publications will be made available there if allowed  \nby copyright agreements, possibly after an embargo as determined  \nby the publisher. Before the end of the embargo or in cases where  \nsharing the post-print is not allowed due to copyright agreements, a  \npre-print  version  of  the  manuscript  will  be  made  available.  \nPublications will also be automatically added to our institutional  \nrepository, Lirias 2.0, based on the authors name and ORCID ID (the  \nmetadata will be added, not the full manuscripts).\n-Algorithms, scripts and software: All the relevant algorithms, scripts  \nand software code driving the project will be made available to  \npublic repositories such as www.github.com/pasquelab  \n-Nucleic acid and protein sequences: All nucleic acid and protein  \nsequences generated during the project will made publicly available  \nDMP for 1170722N\n12\nvia repositories  such as the GenBank database or the European  \nNucleotide  Archive  (nucleotide  sequences  from  primers  /  new  \ngenes / new genomes), NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (microarray  \ndata / RNA-seq data / CHIPseq data), the Protein Database (for  \nprotein sequences), the EBI European Genome-phenome Archive  \n(EGA)  for  personally  identifiable  (epi)genome  and  transcriptome  \nsequences.\n-Data that do not support publication will be either deposited in an  \nopen access repository or made available upon request by email.\nDMP for 1170722N\n13\nWhen  will \nthe  data  be \nmade \navailable? □ Immediately after the end of the project \nX Upon publication of the research results\n□  After an embargo period. \nAs a general rule all research outputs will be made openly accessible at the  \nlatest  at  the  time  of  publication.  No  embargo  will  be  foreseen  unless  \nimposed e.g. by pending publications, potential IP requirements – note that  \npatent application filing will be planned so that publications need not be  \ndelayed - or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases,  \ndatasets will be made publicly available as soon as the embargo date is  \nreached.\nDMP for 1170722N\n14\nWho  will  be \nable  to \naccess  the \ndata  and \nunder  what \nconditions? Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made  \npublicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As  \ndetailed above, metadata will contain sufficient information to support data  \ninterpretation and reuse, and will be conform to community norms. These  \nrepositories  clearly  describe  their  conditions  of  use  (typically  under  a  \nCreative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication or  \nan ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer  \nagreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to  \naccess data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used  \nby citing the corresponding DOI. A CC-BY license will be opted for when  \npossible. For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement  \n(and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the  \nbeneficiaries  in  order  to  clearly  describe  the  types  of  reuse  that  are  \npermitted.\nFor  KU  Leuven  data  submitted  to  the  EBI  European  Genome-phenome  \nArchive  (EGA),  which  operates  under  controlled  access,  the  data  \naccess/submission requests will be received by the operational committee  \nand processed in consultation with the PIs produced data. The advisory  \ncommittee will provide general guidance in terms of policies and will be  \nreferred to in handling controversial cases. \nWhat are the \nexpected \ncosts  for \ndata \nsharing? \nHow  will \nthese  costs \nbe covered? It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing  \nstandard  procedures  (internally  generated  operational  procedures  \n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_operating_procedure ))   e.g.  for \nmetadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the  \nproject,  and  by  using  free-to-use  data  repositories  and  dissemination  \nfacilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the  \nlaboratory budget.\n7.Responsibilities\nWho  will  be \nresponsible \nfor  the  data \ndocumentati\non  & \nmetadata? Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time  \nof data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic  \nlaboratory notebook (E-notebook) that refer to specific datasets.\nDMP for 1170722N\n15\nWho  will  be \nresponsible \nfor  data \nstorage  & \nback  up \nduring  the \nproject? I will ensure data storage and back up, with support from ICTS, HPC, and  \ngbiomed-IT staff.\nWho  will  be \nresponsible \nfor  ensuring \ndata \npreservation \nand sharing? The PI is responsible for data preservation and sharing, with support from  \nICTS, HPC, and gbiomed-IT staff.\nWho  bears \nthe  end \nresponsibility \nfor  updating \n& \nimplementin\ng this DMP? The PI is ultimately responsible for all data management during and after  \ndata collection, including implementing and updating the DMP."

In the case a decision is taken to file a patent application it will be planned so that publications need not be delayed. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?X No □ Yes No third-party agreement restricts dissemination or exploitation of the data from this project. 3.Documentation and metadata What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of the data collected/gener ated in this project? Documentation will consist of notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook) that refer to specific datasets. Those notes will describe the biological samples used, experimental setup and protocols used, sequences generated, the links to the specific computer location as well as the names of the respective datasets. I will also maintain a metadata sheet with the connection between lab samples and files on our data storage, so that data files, lab samples, and experimental notes remain properly linked. Algorithms, scripts and software usage will be documented, e.g. using Jupyter Notebooks. When scripts, algorithms and software tools are finalized, they will be additionally described in manuscripts and on GitHub (see www.github.com/pasque lab for our previous datasets and scripts). DMP for 1170722N 6 Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used. If not, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse.□ No X Yes Sequencing data types require particular metadata, such as data submitted to EGA, GEO, SRA, ArrayExpress, or ENA. Local data that is not (yet) submitted to these resources will be based on generalized metadata schema such as Dublin Core or DataCite, including the following elements: • Title: free text • Creator: Last name, first name, organization • Date and time reference • Subject: Choice of keywords and classifications • Description: Text explaining the content of the data set and other contextual information needed for the correct interpretation of the data, the software(s) (including version number) used to produce and to read the data, the purpose of the experiment, etc. • Format: Details of the file format, • Resource Type: data set, image, audio, etc. • Identifier: DOI (when applicable) • Access rights: closed access, embargoed access, restricted access, open access. When depositing data in a local or public repository, the final dataset will be accompanied by this information under the form of a README.txt document. This file will be located in the top level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used (see section 7 below). This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse. DMP for 1170722N 7 4.Data storage & backup during the FWO project Where will the data be stored? Digital files will be stored on KU Leuven servers. -Omics data: omics data generated during the project will either be stored on KU Leuven servers or on the Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC), initially in the staging + archive area and later only in the archive area (archive is mirrored). -Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock (-80°C). All published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request. -Algorithms, scripts and software: All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software code driving the project will be stored in private online git repositories of the PI (e.g., .https://github.com/pasquelab). As soon as the manuscript is publicly available, the repository will be changed to a public repository. -Nucleic acid and protein sequences: All nucleic acid and protein sequences generated during the project will be stored on KU Leuven servers. Upon publication, all sequences supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via repositories such as the GenBank database or the European Nucleotide Archive (nucleotide sequences from primers / new genes / new genomes), NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (microarray data / RNA-seq data / CHIPseq data), the Protein Database (for protein sequences), the EBI European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) for personally identifiable (epi)genome and transcriptome sequences. -Other data files (Digital images, cytometry data, etc..) will be stored on local KU Leuven servers and PI computers. How will the data be backed up? KU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme: - data stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept. - data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept. - All omics data stored on the Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC) will be transferred on a monthly basis to the archive area which is mirrored. DMP for 1170722N 8 Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. □ No X Yes There is sufficient storage and back-up capacity on all KU Leuven servers: - the “L-drive” is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster with NetApp series storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front-end. - the “J-drive” is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controllers with an Ontap 9.1P9 operating system. - the Staging and Archive on VSC are also sufficiently scalable (petabyte scale) What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How will these costs be covered? The total estimated cost of data storage during the project is ˜9,000 EUR. This estimation is based on the following costs: -The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 128,39€/TB/Year for the “L-drive” and 519EUR/TB/Year for the “J-drive”. -The cost of VSC archive is 70 EUR/TB/Year, and staging 130EUR/TB/Year. -We expect costs to drop slightly during the coming four years. Additional budget for compute and data storage is budgeted for in ongoing projects, and will be costed in complementary project applications. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? -The “L-drive” and “J-drive” servers are accessible only by laboratory members and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. -The VSC storage is only accessible to VSC accounts, and specifically our volume is only accessible to group members. -No personal data will be stored on the VSC nor local servers. DMP for 1170722N 9 5.Data preservation after the end of the FWO project KU Leuven expects that data generated during the project are retained for a period of minimally 5 years after the end of the project, in as far as legal and contractual agreements allow. Which data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).The minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)? As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org ), at the latest at the time of publication or preprint deposition. For all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows: -Large sequencing/omics data: will be stored on VSC archive -Small digital files: files will be stored on the “L-drive”. -Developed algorithms and software will be stored on VSC archive and/or L-drive, as well on public repositories such as Github.com. -Third-party software and algorithms that are used are referenced by their version numbers (e.g., in our Jupyter notebooks), and are installed as modules on the VSC and/or containers (Docker, Singularity) on the VSC, to ensure reproducibility. DMP for 1170722N 10 What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 5 years? How will the costs be covered? The total estimated cost of data storage during the 5 years after the end of the is 2,500 EUR. This estimation is based on 70EUR/Tb/year. The storage after the project is much smaller because during the project a large working space is needed, and post-publication data will be made accessible via open access platforms. The costs for this data preservation will be upfront paid for from this FWO project 6.Data sharing and reuse Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? X No □ Yes Which data will be made available after the end of the project? The PI in the present project is committed to publish research results to communicate them to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made openly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new collaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. negative data). DMP for 1170722N 11 Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? X In an Open Access repository X In a restricted access repository □ Upon request by mail X Other (specify): open-access publications in peer-reviewed journals, including supplemental information As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing ( www.fairsharing.org ). Sharing policies for specific research outputs are detailed below: -Omics datasets will be deposited in open access repositories such as the EMBL-EBI platform for genomics and epigenomics data, or the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the EBI ArrayExpress databases for functional genomics data or the EBI European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) for personally identifiable genetic and phenotypic data. Data at EGA will be collected from individuals whose consent agreements authorise data release only for specific research use to bona fide researchers. -Other digital datasets that support publications (including image, cytometry data, and simulation data) will be made publicly available via an open research data platform such as Mendeley Data or Zenodo. -Research documentation: All protocols used to generate published data will be described in the corresponding manuscript(s), and the related documentation will be included as supplementary information. These data and all other documents (daily logs, raw data) deposited in the E-Notebook are accessible to the PI and the research staff, and will be made available upon request. -Manuscripts: All scientific publications will be shared openly. Manuscripts submitted for publication will be deposited in a pre- print server such as bioRxiv, arXiv, Nature Precedings or ASAPbio). At the time of publication, research results will be summarized on the PI’s website (http://www.kuleuven.be/pasquelab ) and post-print pdf versions of publications will be made available there if allowed by copyright agreements, possibly after an embargo as determined by the publisher. Before the end of the embargo or in cases where sharing the post-print is not allowed due to copyright agreements, a pre-print version of the manuscript will be made available. Publications will also be automatically added to our institutional repository, Lirias 2.0, based on the authors name and ORCID ID (the metadata will be added, not the full manuscripts). -Algorithms, scripts and software: All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software code driving the project will be made available to public repositories such as www.github.com/pasquelab -Nucleic acid and protein sequences: All nucleic acid and protein sequences generated during the project will made publicly available DMP for 1170722N 12 via repositories such as the GenBank database or the European Nucleotide Archive (nucleotide sequences from primers / new genes / new genomes), NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (microarray data / RNA-seq data / CHIPseq data), the Protein Database (for protein sequences), the EBI European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) for personally identifiable (epi)genome and transcriptome sequences. -Data that do not support publication will be either deposited in an open access repository or made available upon request by email. DMP for 1170722N 13 When will the data be made available? □ Immediately after the end of the project X Upon publication of the research results □ After an embargo period. As a general rule all research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at the time of publication. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, potential IP requirements – note that patent application filing will be planned so that publications need not be delayed - or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be made publicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached. DMP for 1170722N 14 Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse, and will be conform to community norms. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication or an ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. A CC-BY license will be opted for when possible. For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted. For KU Leuven data submitted to the EBI European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA), which operates under controlled access, the data access/submission requests will be received by the operational committee and processed in consultation with the PIs produced data. The advisory committee will provide general guidance in terms of policies and will be referred to in handling controversial cases. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures (internally generated operational procedures (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_operating_procedure )) e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. 7.Responsibilities Who will be responsible for the data documentati on & metadata? Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook) that refer to specific datasets. DMP for 1170722N 15 Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project? I will ensure data storage and back up, with support from ICTS, HPC, and gbiomed-IT staff. Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and sharing? The PI is responsible for data preservation and sharing, with support from ICTS, HPC, and gbiomed-IT staff. Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementin g this DMP? The PI is ultimately responsible for all data management during and after data collection, including implementing and updating the DMP."
