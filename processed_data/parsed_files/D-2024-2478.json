Chemical and photochemical reactions are the two promising methods to anchor the functional\ngroups on 2D materials, in which the former reaction induces large-scale modification while the latter introduces spatially localized defects (sub-\nmicron precision). Indeed, the precise control over the covalent functionalization of 2D materials at the molecular level still remains a challenging task\ndue to the lack of molecular identity, spatial distribution, and density at the molecular level. In this proposal, a novel multicomponent reversible\ngraphene superlattice consisting of both covalent and non-covalent bound moieties will be constructed with the aid of nano spectroscopy techniques\nsuch as TERS and nanoIR. The customized modulation of electrical and optical properties of the superlattice by exploiting the molecular switching\nevents through external stimuli will enable the fabrication of multifunctional graphene substrates. The nano-spectroscopy techniques together with\nstate-of-the-art surface analyzing techniques (AFM, STM, KPFM) permit real-time nanoscale chemical mapping and molecular visualization on the\ngraphene layer. Furthermore, the synergy between STM/AFM imaging and time-resolved optical spectroscopy will be employed in this project in order\nto resolve the real-time ensembled dynamics of photoisomerization and the associated selfassembly of the photochromic molecules on the graphene\nlayer. The sub-nanoscale molecular information will facilitate precise Fermi-level engineering. Finally, the feasibility of devising new flexible and\ntransparent field-effect transistors (FET) devices using the newly architect graphene superlattices will be scrutinized.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n23-01-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

The Matlab program developed by the host laboratory will be reused for data analysis, specifically for Raman mapping on patterned graphene surfaces. Furthermore, the established protocol for direct laser patterning on graphene substrates, as published by the host lab, will be reused in this project to compare with newly developed patterning protocols on graphene. 1.2 What types and formats of data and other research outputs will the project generate or re-use? 1.2 What types and formats of data and other research outputs will the project generate or re-use? During the project, raw data will be generated from instruments. The data type will strongly depend on the individual instruments and their specific purposes, ranging from the spectroscopic data and their exported format (txt, ASCII, SPC), microscopic images (png, jpg, tiff), videos (avi), other instrumental images (.aist), analyzed data (OPJ, OPJU, jpg, pdf), and program (.mat). The experimental raw data will be analyzed further with the aid of home-build programs. Additionally, physical data including graphene substrates, lab notes, and newly developed protocols will be generated during the project. 1.3 What is the purpose of the data generation or re-use and its relation to the objectives of the project? 1.3 What is the purpose of the data generation or re-use and its relation to the objectives of the project? Through this project, we aim to upscale the fundamental knowledge of spatially controlled nanopatterning on 2D materials and fabricate a novel photo-switchable hybrid graphene superlattice. To fulfill the proposed objectives, various spectroscopic and imaging data need to be acquired. During the chemical patterning of graphene, micro-Raman spectroscopy data, Raman images, optical images, AFM, and KPFM images will be acquired. In addition, nano-IR and Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy data will also generated in order to understand the spatial heterogeneity and density of the covalently anchored molecule on the patterned graphene layer. Furthermore, STM and AFM images and time- resolved optical spectroscopy data will also be generated to study the ensembled molecular dynamics of the photochromic molecule on the Created using DMPonline.be.
