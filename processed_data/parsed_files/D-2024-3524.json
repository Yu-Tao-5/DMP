In 1878, 25 complete dinosaur skeletons were found in Belgium. This was of great \ninternational importance, but also impacted the perception of dinosaurs in Belgium itself. In a country \nwith little history in paleontological expertise, it came down to bringing in and appropriating knowledge, \nknow -how and images. This project therefore researches visual and textual images of dinosaurs in B elgium \nin the period 1854 -1914 from a transnational perspective. It sheds light on the dynamics at play in \nshowing, consuming and shaping these images, tracing influences throughout cultural circuits, scientific \nknowledge sharing, and personal networks. In  so doing, it will reveal which representations of dinosaurs \ncirculated here, why, and what meaning was bestowed upon them from a Belgian perspective. To this end, \nthis research examines sources from the natural history museum, popular science texts, scien ce \nperformances  and fiction stories, supplemented by critical reviews. Textual and visual sources are studied \nin tandem through discourse analysis and iconological analysis. A network analysis maps how images, \nmeanings and cultural influences could travel through differe nt connections. The dinosaur as a human \nconstruct, then, functions as a site through which broader processes of cultural apprehension of scientific \ncontent can be studied.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        3 \n 2.

In 1878, 25 complete dinosaur skeletons were found in Belgium. This was of great international importance, but also impacted the perception of dinosaurs in Belgium itself. In a country with little history in paleontological expertise, it came down to bringing in and appropriating knowledge, know -how and images. This project therefore researches visual and textual images of dinosaurs in B elgium in the period 1854 -1914 from a transnational perspective. It sheds light on the dynamics at play in showing, consuming and shaping these images, tracing influences throughout cultural circuits, scientific knowledge sharing, and personal networks. In so doing, it will reveal which representations of dinosaurs circulated here, why, and what meaning was bestowed upon them from a Belgian perspective. To this end, this research examines sources from the natural history museum, popular science texts, scien ce performances and fiction stories, supplemented by critical reviews. Textual and visual sources are studied in tandem through discourse analysis and iconological analysis. A network analysis maps how images, meanings and cultural influences could travel through differe nt connections. The dinosaur as a human construct, then, functions as a site through which broader processes of cultural apprehension of scientific content can be studied.

It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all materials that need proper management because they are valuable, difficult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentation/metadata. RDM Guidance on data If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type . NA Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number . ☐ Yes, human subject data ; provide SMEC or EC a pproval number: ☐ Yes, animal data ; provide ECD reference number: ☐ Yes, dual use; provide approva l number : ☒ No Additional information : Will you process personal data1? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number). ☐ Yes (provide PRET G -number or EC S -number below) ☒ No Additional information: Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer , for example spin - offs, commercial exploitation, … )? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes , please comment : 1 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 8 Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements , research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3. Documentation and Metadata FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9 Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata . All documentation needed can be stored in README -files, accompanying the data. These files will contain the following information: For 1. Literature: bibliographic information The metadata -template I used, so the data can be correctly interpreted. Also, some explanation on my own research topic is crucial, because it is the frame in which the relations between all these literature become clear. Additionally, I will clarify I generated these data through Zotero. For 2. Sources: digitized sources The metadata -template I used, so the data can be correctly interpreted. Also, some explanation on my own research topic is crucial, because it is the frame in which the relations between all these sources become clear. Additionally, I will clarify how I generated these data through Tropy and Zotero. Moreover, I will include information on file formats, if I can share digitisations or photographs of sources, and specify the agreements I made with the heritage institution. For 2. Sources: bibliographic information The metadata -template I used, so the data can be correctly interpreted. Also, some explanation on my own research topic is crucial, because it is the frame in which the relations between all these sources become clear. Additionally, I will clarify how I generated these data through Tropy and Zotero. For 3. Notes These notes first and foremost need context information about my research topic, but also about my research questions, since these \"drive\" the notes; they are the reason I make these notes in my thinking process towards my research goals. Additionally, I will document file formats, the fact that I made them in Obsidian alongside paper notebooks, and give some more explanations on the abbreviations I use (and invented myself). Also, I will document how these notes functioned in the folder structure I use. Me tadata on the literature I am actually writing about is also crucial; in doing so I will clarify how I linked these literature items to the notes I made about them, so people can interpret how they are related. A (self - made) thesaurus for the terms I use and what they mean will also be included. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10 For 4. Relational database These data first and foremost need context information about my research topic. In so doing I will also explain why I gathered the data I gathered and why I structured it the way I did. Additionally, information on how I generated these data using Nodegoat is necessary . A (self -made) thesaurus for the terms I use and what they mean will also be included. In order to correctly interpret the historical information, metadata on my sources is relevant, including my notes on the historical figures present in the database . FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: Literature References of literature will be managed in Zotero. This means I use the fields in Zotero to store my metadata according to the formats as used in Zotero. (Use of capital letters in titles will follow the conventions of the language of the title. ) Sources Metadata on sources will be organized in Tropy and Zotero . - For books and booklets , I will use the same data as in Zotero. I will add a field about digitization and add my own name, indicating that I myself took a photograph to digitize the source. - For archival sources like ephemera I will use the Generic template in Tropy. For announcements of science shows, I will add a field for the location where the show took place. I will add a field about digitization and add my own name, indicating that I myself took a photograp h to digitize the source. - For periodicals , I will use the same data as in Zotero. I will add a field about digitization and add my own name, indicating that I myself took a photograph to digitize the source. - For letters I will use the Correspondence template in Tropy. I will add a field about digitization and add my own name, indicating that I myself took a photograph to digitize the source. - Illustrations require the title of the illustration, the artist(s), and the data of the sources they appeared in. I will add a field about digitization and add my own name, indicating that I myself took a photograph to digitize the source. - For magic lantern plates , I will use the Generic template. I will add a field about digitization and add my own name, indicating that I myself took a photograph to digitize the source. - For sources already digitized by the preserving institutions: I will use the same fields as for the sources I digitized myself, but I will here specify the institution that digitized the sources.

Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data. ☐ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I -drive) ☐ Teams ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on -premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ ManGO ☐ Digital vault ☒ Other: KU Leuven OneDrive for Business (personal) cloud storage How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? ☒ Standard back -up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back -ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No The OneDrive from KU Leuven I use is sufficient for storing all my research materials. If no, please specify : FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13 How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . Guidance on security for research data I will make use of the Onedrive cloud service provided by the Faculty of Arts at KU Leuven: this storage place is safe and automatically backed up. I will use Bitlocker as an additional safety measure to protect the data. This means only I can access the data. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? OneDrive is part of the Microsoft 365 Education A3 plan. The cost of the Microsoft 365 Education A3 licenses within the EES agreement is financed centrally for all KU Leuven students and the majority of active KU Leuven staff. Consequently, I won’t have to cover this cost myself . 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). Guidance on data preservation ☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be ke pt for 10 years (explain) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 14 Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data . Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide . ☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? I do not expect to exceed 50 GB of storage. Under 50 GB, use of KU Leuven RDR is free. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 15 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE ’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE , CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY .

Normally, there's no copyright on the sources themselves, but I will always have to check with the archives what policy they have . Depending on th eir policy I can or cannot share my own digitisations as open data . - Notes : In my notes, I include quotes from literature or sources, so these should be referenced properly before publishing my notes. The rest of my notes are my own ideas, so strictly speaking, I have the copyright on them, but I will check with the archives in qu estion, just in case. So, if allowed by the heritage institutions, I will share my notes as open data. - Relational database : All researched people lived in the 19th century, so I can share personal data on them. Normally copyright should not hinder to share metadata (I created myself) on these peopl e. So, all data will be shared as open data, unless heritage institutions do not allow to publish digitisations of their historic material. However, if that is the case, the metadata I gather on these sources can be shared as open data, which still allows other researchers to consult the sources in question. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. / FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 16 Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☒ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify : The possibility of sharing (digitisations of) historical source material depends on the policies of the preserving heritage institutions.
