At least 50% of all sun-like stars have companions and that fraction\napproaches 100% for the most massive stars. This makes binaries and multiple systems the norm rather than the exception. Binary physics is thus an\nabsolutely necessary and critical ingredient for understanding how stars evolve. However, comprehensive models of various physical processes\ninvolved in binary-star evolution are still lacking, and those that do exist suffer from important theoretical uncertainties (associated with, e.g., mass\ntransfer, the angular momentum budget, mass loss, and orbital evolution). As such, present-day predictions for binary-star evolution – and their end-of-\nlife products – are seriously flawed. This obstacle leads to highly uncertain predictions for the frequency of core-collapse supernovae, black holes and\nneutron stars, and hence the frequency of gravitational wave events that can be detected with current and upcoming facilities. The overarching goal of\nthis ambitious C1 BRAVE project is to fundamentally improve our understanding of binary-star physics by (i)} using and developing novel theoretical\nand observational methods to probe the physics of binary stars and (ii) examining in unprecedented detail the role of the binary components in stellar\nevolution. We will develop new 3D radiative-hydrodynamical models for studying the mass and angular momentum budget in binary systems. These\nmodels will be confronted with high-quality data that not only trace the contemporary impact, but also the long-term outcome of the binary interaction.\nThis will lead to new publicly available binary-evolution algorithms that will allow us to explore the binary-star parameter space in statistical studies\nand to follow in detail the evolution of each component in the system. As such, the results of this C1 will strongly impact the wide range of fields in\nastronomy relying on a firm understanding of binary star evolution, and will lead to the consolidation of a KU Leuven excellence pole on binary star\nevolution that is unique at the international scientific landscape.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n22-03-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The Institute of Astronomy of KU Leuven has an automatic periodic backup (daily and off-site) on the network server of raw and processed data according to KU Leuven and in-house security standards: all data are secured with access restrictions on file-system level. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Data storage needs are estimated at 50 TB. Including backups this totals 150 TB of server space or 15keuro. These costs are currently included partially in the BRAVE budget and partially in the recently granted KU Leuven Methusalem SOUL budget. Created using DMPonline.be.

Data Sharing and Reuse Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, as open data All computational tools will be open-source on Github for the benefit of the scientific community at large, in particular for those astrophysical projects that rely on modern numerical modelling. Moreover, the output of all models will be available in an open online repository or ‘synthetic virtual observatory’ at the Virtual Observatory. Furthermore, all relevant tables, databases etc. given in the publications will be downloadable from the Strasbourg Astronomical Data Center (CDS). The CDS is a data center dedicated to the collection and worldwide distribution of astronomical data and related information (https://cds.unistra.fr/about/cds/). All journal publications will be open access via the ArXiv.org and Lirias servers. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.
