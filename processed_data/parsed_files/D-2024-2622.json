WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? ☐ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back-ups I make (specify) ☒ Other (specify) For the large volume storage, we will use Tier-1 data for which two copies are stored in two different locations: https://docs.vscentrum.be/data/tier1data/introduction.html FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data Password and key-protected access to Vlaams Computer Centrum High Performance Computing, including Tier-1 Data. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?HPC Tier-2 storage: 1500 EUR/year, covered by the bench fee of the FWO grant. Tier-1 Data (large volume storage) will be financed by the Tier-1 grants of the Storage4Climate consortium, a network of five modelling groups in Flanders. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☐ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☒ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Final generated data used in publications will be preserved. Re-used data will not necessarily be preserved unless they remain used or are no longer supplied by the original data providers. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?As done for the data storage during the project, for the large volume storage, we will use Tier-1 data for which two copies are stored in two different locations: https://docs.vscentrum.be/data/tier1data/introduction.html There is currently no guarantee that the current Storage4Climate grant for large-volume storage will be extended for ten years. If this grant ends, alternative funding will be searched for the largest datasets that cannot be stored on tier-2 storage. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☐ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: All newly generated datasets will be shared publicly as part of publications and published at Zenodo. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☒ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify: The in situ water level data that is shared by international researchers for the analyses in PEATWATER will not generally be shared publicly as raw data. All other reuse data is publicly available and all newly generated data will be made publicly available. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Other data repository (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Zenodo When will the data be made available? ☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. Check the RDR guidance on licences for data and software sources code or consult the License selector tool to help you choose. ☒ CC-BY 4.0 (data) ☐ Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) ☐ MIT licence (code) ☐ GNU GPL-3.0 (code) ☐ Other (specify) Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☒ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☐ No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? No additional resources are needed. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 147.
