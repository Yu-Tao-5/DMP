It affects a massive number of people each year and inflicts\nsignificant challenges to the society and the environment. Compared to other natural hazards,\nthe identification and characterization of drought are more challenging because of its slow onset\nand slow recovery, lack of a unified definition and the difficult specification of its exact area. It\nbecomes even more complex by the interdependencies between drought characteristics and\nbetween drought and other extreme events such as heatwaves. A concurrent occurrence of\ndrought and heatwave events can cause more severe impacts than any of the single hazards\nalone. The occurrence probability of such compound events is expected to rise due to climate\nchange. Owing to these interdependencies at different spatial and temporal scales, a univariate\nanalysis may lead to a significant underestimation of the overall drought impact. It thus calls for\na multivariate analysis for a more realistic estimation of the impact to design adequate\nadaptation strategies, which has been overlooked. This research addresses this knowledge gap\nby a multivariate analysis of the contribution of anthropogenic influences to single drought\nevents and compound drought-heatwave events at the global scale.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
