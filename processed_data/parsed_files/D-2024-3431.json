Readme.xlsx: In this document, the first tab will contain a table of content, furthermore we will note which researchers were involved in the collection of the data (e.g., master students), information regarding the ethical approval (reference number & institution), a short overview of the respective study experiments or questionnaires. 2. visit_overview.xlsx: In this document, we will provide pseudonymized information about all participants that were enrolled in the study, visit dates, and whether they completed all experiments/questionnaires or dropped-out/whether there was equipment failure. 3. Folder with all the study documents: Ethical application and approval, study protocol, study manual with the instructions that were given to participants, informed consent, as well as the PDF of all questionnaires. 4. Pre-processing documents: Comprise the very raw data (pseudonymized) and a manual with instructions to clean and (pre-)process the data. These documents will never contain sensitive (identifiable) participants information such as names, contact details, etc. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: The metadata standard which can be found via www.FAIRsharing.org will not be used. However, within the lab, Readme files can be consulted to gather all relevant information. Regarding data-sharing repositories, metadata will be provided according to guidelines provided by the respective platforms. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 114.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☒ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☒ Other: ManGo How will the data be backed up?

DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.Digital documents will be digitally backed up on BIOMED L-Drive for large volume storage (secure KU Leuven facility for archiving) and MANGO storage environment. Paper documents will be scanned and digitally backed up on BIOMED L-Drive for large volume storage (secure KU Leuven facility for archiving), and MANGO storage environment. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: There is sufficient space for all types of data on both the L drive and the MANGO environment, both allow to extend the storage capacity if necessary If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7The personal nature of OneDrive ensures that files that are not explicitly shared, are not accessible to anyone else. As such, a separate folder will be created and encrypted for the current dataset. Only the PI and registered collaborating researchers will have access to this folder via the encryption key. The KU Leuven network drives (e.g. L-drive) and Mango environment are incorporated within secured KU Leuven environments, are password-protected (including smartphone-based multi-factor identification) and are only accessible by registered collaborating researchers. Only the PI can request access to the network drive and Mango for study personnel. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?The OneDrive (500gB) comes free of charge for students and personnel of KU Leuven. The Department of Neurosciences provides our research group (Center for Developmental Psychiatry) with an L-drive. As such, costs will be covered by the department. The mango environment has a yearly cost of 35€ per TB FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 135. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?Long term data storage will take place on the L drive. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Costs will be covered by the principal investigator FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 146. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY.

If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.Only published data (and associated scripts) will be available in the form of publications or other dissemination of scientific work. All data will be pseudonymized when disseminated. More data can be made available or shared after permission of the responsible person (prof. Bart Boets). Non-published data will remain confidential until a final decision on publication of the data has been taken. Data can be reused by direct colleagues, after consultation and approval of the head of CDP (prof. Bart Boets). External researchers will have to motivate why they want access to the data. When this data is being used by other researchers, they are required to give credit to the original data creators. When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.Upon publication of research results Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 CC-BY 4.0 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 16Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes: a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Given that most data repositories are free of charge, no costs are expected for data sharing. 7.
