Data types include primarily: (1) video files (rat behavior, avi-files or mp4-files, circa 4-5 TB,  \nrecorded with video cameras connected to a computer) and (2) audio files (rat ultrasonic vocalizations, wav-files, circa 4-5 TB, recorded with ultrasound  \nmicrophones connected to a computer). Additionally, (3) automated behavioral measurements (e.g. locomotor activity, nose-poking) will be recorded in Excel  \n(xlsx-files, circa 2-3 MB, recorded with infrared light sensors connected to a computer). Of note, recordings of rat ultrasonic vocalizations are large in size, with  \none hour of recording resulting in about 2 GB. Video files will likewise result in a significant amount of data. Other datatypes will include biomaterials (e.g. DNA,  \nRNA, protein, tissue samples, such as brain and tail samples), typically later converted into images (not expected to exceed 400 GB over the course of the project,  \ndetails still need to be determined as ordering of relevant equipment is still ongoing). All data will be stored in digital form (e.g. AVI or MP4 files for video  \nrecordings, WAV files for audio recordings, TIFF files for gel images). Measurements derived from video and audio files, automated behavioral measurements,  \nand biomaterial will be recorded in Excel (for long-term preservation, converted into CSV files) and SPSS for statistical analyses.

Data types include primarily: (1) video files (rat behavior, avi-files or mp4-files, circa 4-5 TB, recorded with video cameras connected to a computer) and (2) audio files (rat ultrasonic vocalizations, wav-files, circa 4-5 TB, recorded with ultrasound microphones connected to a computer). Additionally, (3) automated behavioral measurements (e.g. locomotor activity, nose-poking) will be recorded in Excel (xlsx-files, circa 2-3 MB, recorded with infrared light sensors connected to a computer). Of note, recordings of rat ultrasonic vocalizations are large in size, with one hour of recording resulting in about 2 GB. Video files will likewise result in a significant amount of data. Other datatypes will include biomaterials (e.g. DNA, RNA, protein, tissue samples, such as brain and tail samples), typically later converted into images (not expected to exceed 400 GB over the course of the project, details still need to be determined as ordering of relevant equipment is still ongoing). All data will be stored in digital form (e.g. AVI or MP4 files for video recordings, WAV files for audio recordings, TIFF files for gel images). Measurements derived from video and audio files, automated behavioral measurements, and biomaterial will be recorded in Excel (for long-term preservation, converted into CSV files) and SPSS for statistical analyses. Manuscripts will be written in Word. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 7GUIDANCE: DATA CAN BE DIGITAL OR PHYSICAL (FOR EXAMPLE BIOBANK, BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES, …).

For video files (rat behavior) the following information will be noted: rat ID(s), date, time, protocol (i.e. SOP), and experimenter. The methodology and protocol will be described in detail in the lab book. For audio files (rat ultrasonic vocalizations) the following information will be noted: rat ID(s), date, time, protocol (i.e. SOP), and experimenter. The methodology and protocol will be described in detail in the lab book. For automated behavioral measurements (e.g. locomotor activity, nose-poking) the following information will be noted: rat ID(s), date, time, protocol (i.e. SOP), and experimenter. The methodology and protocol will be described in detail in the lab book. For other datatypes the following information will be noted: rat ID(s), date, time, protocol (i.e. SOP), and experimenter. The methodology and protocol will be described in detail in the lab book. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: Metadata include a unique rat ID, together with its birth date, genotype, sex, and experimental condition. All other data are linked to the individual animal through the unique rat ID only (but not birth date, genotype, sex, and experimental condition) to avoid a bias during data acquisition and analysis. After completing relevant parts of the data acquisition process, data will be merged in SPSS linking all relevant data through the unique rat ID. 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10Where will the data be stored? There are several provisions in place in order to preserve the data during and after the end of the research. Data will be stored on hard drives during experiments. After the experiments, data will be transferred to two external hard drives (two copies; one working copy and one backup copy) and metadata will additionally be transferred to the large, safe, and automatically backed up central network device of KU Leuven, OneDrive. In addition, it is planned to make exemplary audio files, i.e. recordings of ultrasonic vocalizations, available to the scientific community through an online platform similar to mouseTube. Furthermore, it is planned to upload metadata of key confirmatory studies to a general repository (e.g. Open Science Framework). For optimal storage of biomaterials, fridges, -20°C freezers, and -80°C freezers will be used. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.For backup, the data will be stored on external hard drives (two copies; one working copy and one backup copy) and metadata will be additionally transferred to the university's central servers with automatic daily backup procedures, for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. External hard drives (with a capacity of several TB) will be ordered before the start of data acquisition. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify concisely: If no, please specify: External hard drives (with a capacity of several TB) will be ordered before the start of data acquisition. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7Data acquisition is performed in an animal laboratory with limited access. External hard drives and computers are bitlocker/ password protected and PhD and postdoctoral researchers will keep the external hard drives in a cabinet that can be locked. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Circa 2000 € for external hard drives, acquired during the project period and covered through FWO funding. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).Data storage during and after the end of the research project does not differ. There are several provisions in place in order to preserve the data during and after the end of the research. According to the Research Data Management policy at KU Leuven, all relevant research data will be kept for at least 10 years after the end of the research. Data will be stored on hard drives during experiments. After the experiments, data will be transferred to two external hard drives (two copies; one working copy and one backup copy) and metadata will additionally be transferred to the large, safe, and automatically backed up central network device of KU Leuven, OneDrive. In addition, it is planned to make exemplary audio files, i.e. recordings of ultrasonic vocalizations, available to the scientific community through an online platform similar to mouseTube. Furthermore, it is planned to upload metadata of key confirmatory studies to a general repository (e.g. Open Science Framework). Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?For long-term storage, the data will be stored on external hard drives (two copies; one working copy and one backup copy) and metadata will be additionally transferred to the university's central servers with automatic daily backup procedures, for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period?
