A reliable preoperative evaluation is pivotal to \ntailor the most appropriate procedure, estimate the surgical complexity, select the most \nappropriate surgical team, and provide correct patient counselling. This will optimize \npatients’ outcome, avoiding unnecessary or inappropriate procedures and minimize \noperation time and costs for both patients and health service. In myometrial lesions, the \npreoperative differentiation between benign (myoma) and malignant (sarcoma) lesions is of \nutmost importance: the former is often managed conservatively or treated by laparoscopic \nresection and morcellation, while the latter requires radical surgery by an oncological \nsurgeon, morcellation being absolutely contraindicated. In endometriosis, correct detection \nand mapping of deep endometriosis lesions will determine the indication and the radicality \nof the surgery. The aim of our project is to develop innovative management algorithms for \nboth myometrial lesions and deep endometriosis. As first line evaluation, alongside the \npatient’s history and clinical examination, we will define relevant sonographic features, \nbased on our recent consensus papers on the systematic ultrasonographic evaluation of the \nmyometrium and of endometriosis. As second line evaluation, alongside MRI, we will assess \nthe added value of novel liquid biopsy biomarkers.\nInstitution KU Leuven\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 2 of 91.Data Description\nWhat data will you collect or create?

When entering data, the user needs to enter a self-created patient \nidentifier.  Subsequently, a case identifier is automatically created, adding an additional \nlayer of pseudonymization. When exported, the data only contain the case ID created by \nthe program itself.  \nThe Clinical Data Miner  (CDM) has already been used for other multicenter studies at\nUZ Leuven: e.g. the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA)-study, including over\n6000 cases and lead by prof dr Dirk Timmerman and the International Endometrial Tumor \nAnalysis (IETA)-study, including 3000 cases and coordinated by prof dr Dirk Timmerman and \nprof dr Thierry Van den Bosch.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 7 of 9Which back-up procedures are in place?\nThe Clinical Data Miner  server follows best practices with regard to security. It runs on a \nhardened Linux server with a restrictive firewall. Security updates are installed \nautomatically. The data on the server are backed up to a remote server on a daily basis.  \nDescribe the data security procedures and who has access to the data.\nOur web server uses encrypted channels using SSL / HTTPS for all client-server \ncommunication.
