Previously, I showed that proteins with sequence segments\nhomologous to A\nβ\n aggregation-prone regions can affect A\nβ\n aggregation and modify fibril morphology, a mechanism that could help explain regional\nvulnerability to protein aggregation. Here, I will study this co-aggregation and co-deposition mechanism in a more disease-relevant cellular model that\nalso considers the contribution of microglia to plaque formation, with a focus on proteins that are disease-relevant because of their function, and tissue-\nand cell-specific expression patterns. This research will dive deeper into heterotypic aggregation and will unravel important aspects of A\nβ\n toxicity by\nmapping sequence-specific interactions between disease amyloids and the brain proteome.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n25-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

A protein relevant for Alzheimer disease and modifying\nproteins that promote amyloid formation and those that slow down amyloid formation would be of great interest as potential therapeutic\ntargets. We do hope that the proposed work will lead to tech transfer and valorisation of the research data. VIB and KU Leuven has a policy to\nactively monitor research data for such potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of\ncases the invention will be IP protected (mostly patent protection or copyright protection). As such the IP protection does not withhold the\nresearch data from being made public. In the case a decision is taken to file a patent application it will be planned so that publications need not\nbe delayed. Further research beyond the scope of this project may be necessary for developing a strong IP portfolio\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Previously, I showed that proteins with sequence segments homologous to A β aggregation-prone regions can affect A β aggregation and modify fibril morphology, a mechanism that could help explain regional vulnerability to protein aggregation. Here, I will study this co-aggregation and co-deposition mechanism in a more disease-relevant cellular model that also considers the contribution of microglia to plaque formation, with a focus on proteins that are disease-relevant because of their function, and tissue- and cell-specific expression patterns. This research will dive deeper into heterotypic aggregation and will unravel important aspects of A β toxicity by mapping sequence-specific interactions between disease amyloids and the brain proteome.

Yes The goal of the project is to find proteins that interfere with amyloid formation Ab42. A protein relevant for Alzheimer disease and modifying proteins that promote amyloid formation and those that slow down amyloid formation would be of great interest as potential therapeutic targets. We do hope that the proposed work will lead to tech transfer and valorisation of the research data. VIB and KU Leuven has a policy to actively monitor research data for such potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of cases the invention will be IP protected (mostly patent protection or copyright protection). As such the IP protection does not withhold the research data from being made public. In the case a decision is taken to file a patent application it will be planned so that publications need not be delayed.

Digital files will be stored either on KU Leuven servers or in shared laboratory folders of an off-site online backup service. The researchers working on the project will have copies of the data files as well as of the derived and compiled data stored on their personal computers. The Switch Lab has a professional subscription to an off-site online backup service with unlimited space, version control and roll-back capability, which will be used for storage during the project and after. There is a secondary on-campus physical backup of the online storage which synchronizes with the online content with a one-day delay. Algorithms, scripts and software: All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software code driving the project will be stored in a private online git repository from the GitHub account of the department (https://github.com/vibcbd). The screening core has a database system in place to handle the data stream from the high content imaging screen, including archiving facilities and will store the data during the project. Representative images and the quantitation of the images will be transferred to the Switch laboratory storage for long term storage. Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock (-80°C). All published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request. Cell lines: Newly created cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid nitrogen storage and will be deposited in the UZ Leuven- KU Leuven Biobank.
