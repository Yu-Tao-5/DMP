Because the SMEC asks to anonymize/pseudonize the participants, it is necessary to set up a standardized coding\nsystem. The Dublin Core metadata standard can serve as an inspiration, but I will mainly have to set up my own standardized\ncoding scheme to structure the parameters that I collect from the participants, such as age, gender, nationality, work experience,\n… and link these via a so-called key file to the requested personal data.\nConsidering Zotero as a database, I will use most of the metadate Zotero itself provides, and which are needed for both end- and\nfootnotes and the bibliography (i.e. via Zotero’s browser-plug in). As mentioned in the data table, I am planning to set up a tagging\nsystem in Zotero as well. \nAs I will deposit and share research data via KU Leuven RDR, I will have to use DataCite as a metadata standard there.\nData Storage & Back-up during the Research Project\nData Storage & Back-up during the Research Project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nWhere will the data be stored?\nShared network drive (J-drive)\nPersonal network drive (I-drive)\nSharepoint online\nDuring my research, I store my data on my personal KU Leuven OneDrive for Business-account.

I will add a README file with as much information as possible to keep my data understandable and usable - both for myself and others (i.e. regarding my personal annotation system, the metadata of the transcriptions and/or photographs, how I set up the database and my standardized coding schema, how I structured the fieldnotes and how to read them, how to read the scan of the emotion networks, ...).

Yes In order to create the databases that provide an overview of the participants in the fieldwork, it is necessary to work with spreadsheets. Because the SMEC asks to anonymize/pseudonize the participants, it is necessary to set up a standardized coding system. The Dublin Core metadata standard can serve as an inspiration, but I will mainly have to set up my own standardized coding scheme to structure the parameters that I collect from the participants, such as age, gender, nationality, work experience, … and link these via a so-called key file to the requested personal data. Considering Zotero as a database, I will use most of the metadate Zotero itself provides, and which are needed for both end- and footnotes and the bibliography (i.e. via Zotero’s browser-plug in). As mentioned in the data table, I am planning to set up a tagging system in Zotero as well. As I will deposit and share research data via KU Leuven RDR, I will have to use DataCite as a metadata standard there.

Moreover, the sharing of these materials will also depend on the privacy policy of both platforms and how the KU Leuven/SMEC (will) deal(s) with this issue. online fieldwork: reviews on Google Maps & TripAdvisor: Yes, as these reviews are already public.
