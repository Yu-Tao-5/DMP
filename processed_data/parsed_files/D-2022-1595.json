It is virtually resistant to any sort of therapy, including the most recent\nimmunotherapies. These tumors are characterised by a strong hypoxic, nutrient poor, and acidic\ntumor microenvironment (TME), in which CD8+ T cells are excluded or absent. In the context of\ntumor acidity, the role of bicarbonate transporters, key regulators of pH homeostasis, has mostly\nbeen neglected so far. We recently identified SLC4A4 as the most abundant acid extruder in\nPDAC, expressed exclusively by ductal epithelial cell. Therefore, in this research proposal we aim\nto investigate whether and how SLC4A4 regulates the acidic TME and anti-tumor immunity in the\ncontext of PDAC. The success of this study might pave the way towards groundbreaking\ntherapeutic strategies and combination regimens which are urgently required to tackle tumor\nresistance or refractoriness vis-Ã -vis immunotherapies.This Data Management Plan describes\nhow data will be generated, organized, stored, and backed up throughout the duration of the\nproject and after its completion\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. General Information\nName of the project lead (PI)\nMassimiliano Mazzone\nInternal Funds Project number & title\nResearch project C3/21/047\nExpression of the metabolite transporter SLC4A4 in pancreatic cancer cells promotes immune\nescape and resistance to immunotherapy\n2. Data description\n2.1. Will you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\n2.2. What data will you collect, generate or reuse? Describe the origin, type and\nformat of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a\nnumbered list or table and per objective of the project.\nWe will generate new data from mouse models and human clinical samples, more specifically\ndata of single-cell RNA-sequencing (4-6 TB), microscopy (1-2 T)B, flow cytometry (1-2 TB),\nnucleotide sequences and ELISA (100-200 GB), as well as phagocytosis, cytotoxicity, antigen\npresentation, and  T-cell suppression assays (1-2 GB). Lentiviral vectors, engineered cell lines\nand transgenic mouse strains will be constructed (1-2 GB). Research documentation (data\nanalysis, standard operating procedures, ethical approvals) is kept in a lab book and in electronic\nformats including Graphpad Prism, MS Excel, MS Word and Adobe Portable Document Format\n(10-20 GB). We also aim to compile manuscripts (research articles and reviews, 1-2 GB).\n3. Ethical and legal issues\n3.1. Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you\nwill use. Add the reference to the file in KU Leuven's Record of Processing Activities.\nBe aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNo\n3.2. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s).\nAll animal experiments to be performed have been approved by the Ethical committee for Animal\nExperimentation (ECD) at KU Leuven, and are outlined in ECD project P226/2017 + a new\nadditional ECD currently under approval.\nWork on human clinical samples are conducted according to institutional, national and European\nregulations. In this case, the work performed falls under the umbrella of the MIMIPAC clinical trial\n(MEDI4736, UZ reference S61508).\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 4\n \n \n3.3. Does your research possibly result in research data with potential for tech\ntransfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If\nso, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted?\nYes\nIntellectual property arising from this work will be managed based on the framework agreement\nbetween VIB (VIB Tech Transfer) and KU Leuven, the two participating institutes in this study.\n \n3.4. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the\ndata you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions regarding\nreuse and sharing are in place?\nYes\nYes, and as above, dissemination or exploitation of the data will be managed according to the\nframework agreement between VIB and KU Leuven.\n \n4. Documentation and metadata\n4.1. What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of the\ndata collected/generated in this project?\nProtocols and details related to data collection and processing will be recorded in physical lab\nbooks and transcribed to Word or Excel files by the applicants.  Data folders containing raw and\nprocessed data will be hierarchically organized and labeled based on the source of the data, the\ntype of experiment, the date of data generation, and the different experimental conditions\nanalyzed. Data analysis methods and particularities (including metadata) will be described in text\ndocuments and Excel files included in these folders.\n4.2. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be\nused. If not, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nText documents and Excel files stored within each experiment folder  will respectively contain\nguidelines describing data collection/analysis methods and all relevant metadata (including\nexperimental conditions, sample keys, computational analysis pipelines and their parameters) to\nensure the reusability of the data and the reproducibility of any further data generation.\n \n5. Data storage and backup during the project\n5.1. Where will the data be stored?\nThe institutes (KU Leuven and VIB) have sufficient and scalable storage capacity available, both\nduring the research and during at least 10 years after the end of the research. Data storage and\nbackup is based on a combination of internal servers and external storage with commercial\nproviders such as Microsoft, and with public databases and repositories. Non-public data are\nlogin-protected and accessible to designated staff members only.\n5.2. How will the data be backed up?\nData storage and backup is managed by KU Leuven IT services. Specifically, mirror copies of the\nstored data are made immediately upon upload, for safety backup purposes.\n  \nAll drives options\nare directly accessible from ANYWHERE AFTER starting a Pulse Secure VPN-A connection. Long-\nterm storage, is ensured by the L-drive (stored data can NOT be modified or deleted. This, will\nguarantee the preservation of data over the minimum term of 10 years. Regular computer\nbackups through the inSync platform (unlimited storage) secure the recovery of unsaved data.\n5.3. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes, the KU Leuven L-Drive (unlimited size) has sufficient storage capacity for the outlined\nproject.\n \n5.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nThe annual cost of storage is approximately 569.2 € per 5TB of storage space per year. This cost\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 4\nand capacity include the performance of mirror copies of the stored data, for safety backup\npurposes. We expect that 15 TB will be sufficient to store all data generated as part of the\nproject. These costs will be covered by the budget of the project leaders.\n5.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not\naccessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nDat stored are are login-protected and accessible to designated staff members only.\n6. Data preservation after the end of the project\n6.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the\nproject? If only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is\nthe case (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAs a general rule, data will be preserved for a minimum term of 10 years. Datasets collected in\nthe context of clinical research, which fall under the scope of the Belgian Law of 7 May 2004, will\nbe archived for 25 years, in agreement with the University Hospital policies and the European\nRegulation 536/2014 on clinical trials of medicinal products for human use.\n6.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)?\nLong term storage and backup is based on a combination of internal servers (i.e., L-Drive) and\nexternal storage with commercial providers such as Microsoft and with public databases and\nrepositories.\n6.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How\nwill the costs be covered?\nThe annual cost is approximately  569.2 € per 5TB of storage space per year.
