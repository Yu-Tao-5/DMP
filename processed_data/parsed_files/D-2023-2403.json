These designs are typically used to target three types of research question: Researchers are often interested in contextual influences on the\naffective processes, the dynamics in the affective processes, or how context influences the dynamics. There are some unique challenges associated\nwith addressing these research questions, with important implications for the reliability of modeling results. In this project, I syste    matically\ninvestigate these challenges and possible solutions in the form of modeling strategies. I hope to communicate to the applied literature which issues to\nlook out for, how the reliability of results can be impacted by failing to approach a challenge adequately, and how researchers can use empirical data to\nverify the reliability of their results.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n22-12-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
