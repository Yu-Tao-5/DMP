Current medical management is\ninadequate to alleviate FOG so there is great need for improved treatments. A major bottleneck for treatment development is our inability to measure\nFOG in an accurate, fast, and cheap way given its episodic and heterogeneous nature. Indeed, most FOG occurs in the homes of patients, while the\nclinical gold-standard requires experts to score FOG episodes from videos of patients performing standardized gait tasks in the laboratory. This method\nis expensive and there are privacy concerns when videotaping patients. The future lies in the technological assessment of FOG from wearable sensors\nin the homes of patients. Our group at KU Leuven has developed a new algorithm based on a multi-stage spatial-temporal graph convolutional network\n(MS-GCN) that can accurately detect FOG in the laboratory from inertial sensor data. With this project, I want to address inadequate FOG assessment\nby first validating the use of Stickman animations versus video to overcome the privacy and mobility issues when scoring FOG in the home. Second, I\nwill validate our MS-GCN algorithm for use in the home and investigate its responsiveness towards dopamine medication and types of FOG\nmanifestations. Third, I will determine new signatures of FOG using ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) that can be used to improve FOG\ndetection algorithms and therapy development.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n12-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Current medical management is inadequate to alleviate FOG so there is great need for improved treatments. A major bottleneck for treatment development is our inability to measure FOG in an accurate, fast, and cheap way given its episodic and heterogeneous nature. Indeed, most FOG occurs in the homes of patients, while the clinical gold-standard requires experts to score FOG episodes from videos of patients performing standardized gait tasks in the laboratory. This method is expensive and there are privacy concerns when videotaping patients. The future lies in the technological assessment of FOG from wearable sensors in the homes of patients. Our group at KU Leuven has developed a new algorithm based on a multi-stage spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (MS-GCN) that can accurately detect FOG in the laboratory from inertial sensor data. With this project, I want to address inadequate FOG assessment by first validating the use of Stickman animations versus video to overcome the privacy and mobility issues when scoring FOG in the home. Second, I will validate our MS-GCN algorithm for use in the home and investigate its responsiveness towards dopamine medication and types of FOG manifestations. Third, I will determine new signatures of FOG using ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) that can be used to improve FOG detection algorithms and therapy development.

Digital data will be stored on a secured Large Volume Storage (L-drive) of the KU Leuven with automated backup, for the duration of the project. After completion of the project, this data will be migrated and archived on a secured Large Volume Storage (K-drive) of the KU Leuven, with automated backup that is specifically developed to archive large amounts of electronic data for long periods of time. Additionally, copies can be made on the individual work pc of the researchers involved in the project during data analysis, after which the data will be transferred to the L-drive. The paper copies of the CRF’s will be stored in a secured locker at the Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Building The Nayer, of the KU Leuven. The paper copies that contain identifiable information (i.e. consent forms and subject identification logs) will be stored separately from the other data in a separate folder in a separate cabinet in a separate room. Only authorized personnel will have access to this locked storage room as they will need to be granted access by the PI (prof. Moran Gilat). How will the data be backed up?
