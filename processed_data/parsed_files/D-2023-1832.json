The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions.

Indeed, the sermons reflect a theology in action, seeking to shape \nthe Christian identity of their audiences. Initially focused on the texts of known authors, research is now turning to \nthe sermons of uncertain authorship. My project focuses on the Vienna collection: 60 late antique Latin sermons, \nfalsely attributed to John Chrysostom, which were discovered in the 1990s. They are of great interest because, until \nrecently, they were considered to be the work of a bishop of a ‘dissident’ African Christian group, the so-called \n‘Donatists’. To shed new light on this increasingly contested hypothesis and to unlock the exegesis and theology of \nthe Vienna sermons, I propose a comprehensive study with a set of methodologies that have not yet been applied \nto this collection: a critical edition, and a comprehensive analysis of the content, taking into account the literary \ngenre of these texts (with rhetoric and stylometric tools), and situating their exegetical and theological content \nwithin the patristic tradition (with a historical-critical and comparative method). Among other unexplored aspects, I \nwill investigate the cult of martyrs, the Trinitarian theology (with Subordinatist overtones), and the theology of \njustification and grace (surprisingly close to another ‘dissident’ Christian current, ‘Pelagianism’).\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.
