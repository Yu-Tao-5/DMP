Yet, little empirical research has been executed to predict and explain this\nrecent offence. This study attempts to fill this gap by examining which factors contribute to the\n(non-)occurrence of NCDS. In other words, this study aims to identify the factors that increase or\ndecrease the likelihood of perpetration and victimisation of NCDS, referred to as risk- and\nprotective factors. Through quantitative and qualitative research we aim to expand the\nexplanation and understanding of (the occurrence of) this phenomenon. First, Flemish\nadolescents and emerging adults are surveyed about their possible perpetration and/or\nvictimisation of NCDS and related factors (e.g., socio-demographic factors, contextual factors). In\na second phase, perpetrators and victims are interviewed about their ideas of NCDS in general\nand the relevant contributing factors, as revealed by the survey, in the occurrence of this\noffence. As a result of expanding our understanding of the phenomenon, the study will also\nprovide important insight and guidance for a societal response related to policy, support,\neducation and prevention concerning this behaviour, which in turn helps to prevent the NCDS\nand to protect youth against it.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nYes\nPrivacy Registry Reference: Ethical approval will be obtained before the start of the research.\nThis is currently in preparation: G-2022-4845\nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used: \nThe quantitative study will collect various data from the respondents. Specifically, the survey \nquestionnaire will look at: (1) socio-demographic factors (e.g. age, sex, race/ethnicity, SES,\neducational level), (2) contextual factors (e.g. family functioning, peers), (3) personality factors\n(e.g. dark personality traits, sensation seeking, hypergender orientations), (4) sexuality (e.g.\nsexual orientation, sexual activity, pornography use), (5) sexting activity (e.g. pressurized or\nvoluntary sexting, attitudes towards and experiences with sexting and NCDS, context of sexting\nand NCDS i.e. relationship type and quality of sender and receiver), and (6) awareness of the\nnegative consequences of NCDS (e.g. awareness of the criminality of NCDS and therefore the\npotential for legal consequences, awareness of the negative consequences on victims). The\nsurvey itself does not ask for identification information, but at the end of the online survey\ncertain respondents (i.e. victims and/or perpetrators of NCDS) are asked to cooperate in an\nadditional qualitative interview study on the subject. Interested respondents can leave their\ncontact details on a separate form to ensure that this information cannot be linked to the survey\ndata. The contact details are thus asked in a way that they cannot be linked to the respondentsâ€™\nanswers and are also only used for the practical organization of the interviews. Once the\ninterviews are completed, all the contact details will be deleted. The interviews will explore the\nideas of victims and perpetrators of NCDS about this behaviour in general. In addition, they will\nbe questioned about relevant (dynamic) risk and protective factors in the occurrence of this\nbehaviour, as revealed by the quantitative study. It is therefore not yet certain what data exactly\nwill be collected in the interviews. In addition, the collected data will defer from one interview to\nanother. These interviews will be recorded after permission of the participants. The audio-\nrecordings are solely for the purpose of better transcribing the research data. After each\ninterview the accessory audio file will be transferred to the secured KU Leuven network-drives as\nsoon as possible, and after this be deleted from the portable audio recorder. The interviews are\ntranscribed anonymously: no data that can identify a participant are included in the transcripts.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 6\nWhen the transcription process is completed, the audio files will also be deleted from the KU\nLeuven network-drives.    \nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nYes\nEthical approval will be obtained with SMEC (Social and Societal Ethics Committee) before the\nstart of the research. This is currently in preparation: G-2022-4845\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nWP3, the quantitative survey study: General information on the (quantitative and sampling)\nmethodology and the informed consent procedure is described in detail in the PRET application.\n For the survey data, a codebook with variable-level information will be created (questions in text\nwith associated variable number and label, and answers in text with associated values and value\nlabels (= codes)).   \nWP4, the qualitative interview study: General information on the (qualitative and sampling)\nmethodology and the informed consent procedure is described in detail in the PRET application.\nInformation about the interview (e.g. recording, removal of direct identifiers in the transcripts)\nand instructions for the interviewer and the participants (e.g. the participantâ€™s right to stop the\ninterview at any time) is included in the interview guide, together with the interview questions\nand topic list. Details about the setting and context of the interview will be documented in field\nnotes. A logbook will be drawn up with rules on transcribing the interview data. Then, during\ndata-analysis in NVivo, a hierarchal coding structure will be created with variable-level\ninformation (main and subcodes and their frequencies). Lastly, explanatory comments will be\nadded to these codes in NVivo.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nThe digital data (survey and interview, raw and final) will be stored on the personal One Drive\nstorage of the researcher and on protected network-drives operated by the KU Leuven, with\nservers on university premises. Back-ups for the network-drives are automated. The analog data,\ni.e. informed consent forms of the qualitative study and the interview field notes will be stored in\na locked safe in the researcher's office. The interview audio-recordings, which are solely for the\npurpose of better transcribing the research data, will be transferred to the secured KU Leuven\nnetwork-drives after each interview as soon as possible, and after this be deleted from the\nportable audio recorder. When the transcription process is completed, the audio files will be\ndeleted from the KU Leuven network-drives and the interview field notes will be destroyed. For\nlong-term storage of the digital data we will use the KU Leuven K-drive (dedicated storage for\narchival purposes). The analog data will be stored in the storage/archive unit (locked room) of the\nLeuven Institute of Criminology (LINC).\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 6\nThe digital data will be stored on protected network-drives operated by the KU Leuven. Back-ups\nfor these network-drives are automated.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nGiven the nature and quantity of our research data, we do not expect to exceed the researcherâ€™s\npersonal storage capacity and the storage capacity of the KU Leuven network-drives. In the case\nthat this does happen, it is possible to expand the capacity.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nWe do not expect any costs for data storage. In case we need to expand the storage capacity,\nthis costs will be covered by the FWO bench fee.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nAll research data will be processed confidentially and anonymously. All digital data will be stored\non protected network-drives operated by the KU Leuven. Paper data (i.e. informed consent forms\nof the interview study) will be stored in a locked safe in the researcherâ€™s office. For long time\nstorage of the digital data we will use the KU Leuven K-drive (dedicated storage for archival\npurposes). The paper data will be stored in the LINC storage/archive unit (locked room).\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll collected data will be preserved for at least 10 years after the end of the research (conform\nthe KU Leuven RDM policy), with the exception of the contact details (of certain respondents at\nthe separate form at end of the online survey) and the interview recordings on the portable audio\nrecorder. The contact details will be deleted after the practical organization and completion of\nthe interviews. The audio files will be transferred to the secured KU Leuven network-drives as\nsoon as possible, and after this be deleted from the portable audio recorder. When the\ntranscription process is completed, the audio files will also be deleted from the KU Leuven\nnetwork-drives. We choose to delete these data due to its identifiable and/or sensitive nature.\nMoreover, the paper field notes of the interviews will be destroyed after they are saved\nelectronically with the transcripts in Word.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nFor long-term storage of the digital data (at least 10 years) we will use the KU Leuven K-drive.\nThe analog data, i.e. informed consent forms of the qualitative study, will be stored in the LINC\nstorage/archive unit (locked room).\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nNo costs expected.\n \n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nYes. Specify:\nThe research data can only be used for scientific or societal purposes. The data can not be used\nor shared for any other purpose.\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nThe raw dataset of the quantitative study (no identification information) will be made available\nfor colleague researchers.
