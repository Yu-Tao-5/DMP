Het doel van dit\nproject is om de bron van deze vervuiling aan te pakken door een nieuw toiletblok te ontwikkelen\ndat zorgt voor een chemische oxidatie van farmaceutische micropolluenten uit toiletlozingen.\nToilethygiÃ«neproducten zijn veelgebruikte huishoudchemicaliÃ«n die ontworpen zijn om\ntoiletten te verfrissen en schoon te maken en om bacteriegroei en kalkaanslag te voorkomen.\nHet product dat in dit voorstel wordt ontwikkeld, zal in deze norm voor thuiszorg worden\nopgenomen, zodat farmaceutische micropolluenten op een compacte en flexibele manier aan de\nbron van de verontreiniging in huishoudens kunnen worden verwijderd voordat zij de AWZI's\nbereiken. Op deze manier zal de functionaliteit van de in de handel verkrijgbare toiletblokken\nverbeterd worden.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. General Information\nName of the project lead (PI)\nDeirdre Cabooter, Raf Dewil, Guy Van den Mooter\nInternal Funds Project number & title\nC3/21/041\nToiletblok voor het verwijderen van persistente micropolluenten in sanitair afvalwater (Sani-\nTRouBLe)\n2. Data description\n2.1. Will you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\n2.2. What data will you collect, generate or reuse? Describe the origin, type and\nformat of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a\nnumbered list or table and per objective of the project.\nType of data: chromatograms, these are UV absorbances and m/z values measured as a function\nof time. These data can easily be exported as CSV.files and then further be processed in Excel,\nhence creating xls.data.\nFormulation data will be obtained and presented in the form of Excel files (xls.data). Degradation\ndata will be obtained by integrating chromatograms and will also be respresented in the form of\nExcel files (xls.data).\nData will be created using a liquid chromatography instrument coupled to a UV detector (or diode\narray detector) or mass spectrometer. Throughout the project, it is expected that a total volume\nof 5 GB will be created (one chromatogram is roughly 500 KB).\n3. Ethical and legal issues\n3.1. Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you\nwill use. Add the reference to the file in KU Leuven's Record of Processing Activities.\nBe aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNo\n3.2. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s).\nNo\n3.3. Does your research possibly result in research data with potential for tech\ntransfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If\nso, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted?\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 3\nYes, the idea is to obtain a patentable product.\nThis regards data involving the release potential of certain chemicals that will be compressed in\na rim block and their potential to degrade pharmaceuticals. Obviously these data will be\nrestricted.\n3.4. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the\ndata you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions regarding\nreuse and sharing are in place?\nNo, no 3rd parties are involved\n4. Documentation and metadata\n4.1. What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of the\ndata collected/generated in this project?\nChromatograms will receive following identifier: Name Column_dimensions column_date. The\nmethodology and protocol will be described in detail in the lab book. A ReadMe file of the data\ncollection will be written.\nProtocol for formulation composition, protocol for compounding composition: documentation in\nlab note book and Word file (.doc file)\n4.2. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be\nused. If not, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\n5. Data storage and backup during the project\n5.1. Where will the data be stored?\nThe time-stamped master copy of the data will be kept on our research unit central storage\nfacility. Copies can be made and kept on personal devices. Since we will also collaborate with\nresearchers from other research groups, we will use Box for active use of the data during the\nproject.\n5.2. How will the data be backed up?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic daily back-up\nprocedures.\n5.3. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes.\nWe will request back-up capacities of 100 GB\n5.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nExpected cost for data storage during the project: 2,7 Euro/year. We will use part of the allocated\nproject budget to cover the cost incurred.\n5.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not\naccessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nThe data will be stored on the university's secure environment.\n6. Data preservation after the end of the project\n6.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the\nproject? If only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is\nthe case (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll data generated during the project will be stored for 10 years after the end of the project.\nThese data are the result of substantial financial and personal efforts and therefore of high value\nfor our research group.\n6.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures)\nfor at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 3\n6.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How\nwill the costs be covered?\nThe collected data will be hosted on the servers of KU Leuven. In view of the expected size of the\ndatabase (around 5 GB), estimated cost will be 27 euro over 10 years.\n7. Data sharing and re-use\n7.1. Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data\n(e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions or because of IP\npotential)?\nYes, as we intend to patent the developed product, data regarding the performance of\nthe product will have to remain restricted until the patent is granted.\n7.2. Which data will be made available after the end of the project?\nData regarding the performance of the product can only be made available after the patent is\ngranted (after the project)\n7.3. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn a restricted access repository\nWe will use the new RDR platform for data sharing, when possible\n7.4. When will the data be made available?\nAfter an embargo period. Specify the length of the embargo and why this is necessary\nAfter a patent has been granted (difficult to estimate when exactly)\n7.5. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nOnly the researchers directly involved in the project will have access to the data. Once a patent\nhas been granted, data can be made available publicly\n7.6. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nNeeds to be determined\n8.
