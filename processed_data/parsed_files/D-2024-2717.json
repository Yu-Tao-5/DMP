As somatosensory information is of utmost importance for coordinated upper limb \nmovements and motor learning, somatosensory deficits may hamper effective use of the impaired \nupper limb in bimanual daily life activities. However, an in-depth understanding of somatosensory \ndeficits, their relation to bimanual motor function and knowledge on brain dysfunctions underlying \nsomatosensory deficits, are still lacking. Yet, this information is crucial to improve current upper limb \ntherapies for children with uCP. Therefore, in this project, we will first perform an in-depth \ninvestigation of deficits in different modalities of somatosensation and their influence on bimanual \nmotor function, using clinical assessments and advanced robotics. Secondly, we will examine \nneurological correlates underlying somatosensory deficits, using neuroimaging and innovative brain \nanalysis techniques. Lastly, we will investigate the clinical and neuroplastic effects of a targeted \ntherapy approach focused on somatosensation, i.e. somatosensory discrimination therapy. Hence, \nthe findings of this project will result in an advanced understanding of somatosensory deficits in \nchildren with uCP: from fine-grained assessments to optimization of individualized upper limb \ntherapy.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n17-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Besides motor impairments, up to 90% of these children also have somatosensory deficits in the upper limb. As somatosensory information is of utmost importance for coordinated upper limb movements and motor learning, somatosensory deficits may hamper effective use of the impaired upper limb in bimanual daily life activities. However, an in-depth understanding of somatosensory deficits, their relation to bimanual motor function and knowledge on brain dysfunctions underlying somatosensory deficits, are still lacking. Yet, this information is crucial to improve current upper limb therapies for children with uCP. Therefore, in this project, we will first perform an in-depth investigation of deficits in different modalities of somatosensation and their influence on bimanual motor function, using clinical assessments and advanced robotics. Secondly, we will examine neurological correlates underlying somatosensory deficits, using neuroimaging and innovative brain analysis techniques. Lastly, we will investigate the clinical and neuroplastic effects of a targeted therapy approach focused on somatosensation, i.e. somatosensory discrimination therapy. Hence, the findings of this project will result in an advanced understanding of somatosensory deficits in children with uCP: from fine-grained assessments to optimization of individualized upper limb therapy.

Yes, Ethical aspects Existing data collected during an earlier FWO project (G0C4919N) will be reused within this FWO fellowship. For this existing data, not all parents of participants provided informed consent to share the data with other (academic) partners for other than described in the study goals. Therefore, legal restrictions prevent sharing the full dataset, containing data of 50 children with unilateral cerebral palsy and 59 typically developing children. From this existing dataset, data of 39 children with unilateral cerebral palsy and 50 typically developing children will be uploaded in the ‘KU Leuven Research Data Repository’. For data that will be newly collected within this FWO fellowship, no ethical aspects restrict sharing of research data with academic partners. Since all parents of participants will be asked to provide consent for data sharing with academic partners via the informed consent form. The full dataset of newly collected data, which is expected to consist of data from 50 children with unilateral cerebral palsy and 36 typically developing children, will be uploaded in the ‘KU Leuven Research Data Repository’.
