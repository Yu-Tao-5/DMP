How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? All data will be pseudonymized with unique identifiers. The latter will be stored separately in encrypted files, which can be accessed only by the main researcher (the KU Leuven research by the PI at KU Leuven; the ULB research by the PI at ULB). The pseudonymized data will be shared with the involved researchers. The (internal and external) hard drives of the researchers’ laptops will be encrypted using specialized software. Identifiers will be removed after 5 years. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?
