Most of the lethality is due to malaria complications, such as\ncerebral malaria and malaria-associated acute respiratory distress\nsyndrome. Metabolic disturbances are also highly associated with\nmortality. Current antimalarial treatment is based on highly efficient\nartemisinin combination therapies which have an extremely fast\naction. Despite the rapid killing of most of the malaria parasites in the\nbody, many patients do not recover from the complications and die.\nThis suggests that in those cases, the disease resolution process is\nfailing. In this project, we will first apply high-end technologies to\ninvestigate the mechanisms of disease resolution in relation to the\ndysmetabolism in a mouse model of malaria. Furthermore, we will\nalso use these high-end technologies in a clinical study with severe\nmalaria patients. By obtaining better mechanistic insights into the\ndisease resolution mechanisms, this project will reveal new\npossibilities for improved treatment of severe malaria.\nLast modified: \n27-06-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
