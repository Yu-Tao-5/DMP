Yes Renewable Generation Data, (4) Ørsted (private) data: Yes, there are restrictions specifically for the exploitation and dissemination of Ørsted's private site-level generation data. A unilateral confidentiality agreement has been signed between Ørsted and KU Leuven (acting on behalf of its research unit Electrical Energy Systems and Applications). Under this agreement: The data may only be used within the confines of the project. The data cannot be stored on any server that allows access to individuals outside the project. If I wish to publish work based on this data, Ørsted must be notified at least 30 days prior to the publication deadline and grant approval. Global Physic-based Weather Model Data, (5) Rebase.energy data platform: Historical weather forecasts are publicly available, but not all are archived.

All weather datasets—Global Data-driven Weather Model Data, Local Raw Weather Observations, and Global Physic-based Weather Model Data—will be stored in a centralized repository. Given the expected terabyte-scale volume, we will use specialized preservation tools (e.g., ICTS at KU Leuven) and an organized folder structure. Each dataset will be divided into three versions: Raw: Raw: Unmodified, generated, or fetched data. Intermediate: Intermediate: Processed (cleaned/transformed) data. Final: Final: Data directly used in the experimental forecasting models. Each dataset folder will include following documentation: Python Scripts: Python Scripts: All Python scripts used for preprocessing weather data or generating weather forecasts will be managed via a version control system in GitHub. README Files: README Files: Each Python script will be accompanied by a well-structured README.md file. This file will outline the preprocessing, fetching, or inference procedures, as well as software versions, parameters, file formats, and quality control measures. Data Dictionaries: Data Dictionaries: A dedicated .txt file will list all weather variables, descriptions, units, and data coverage, including detailed latitude and longitude points. It will also specify the required input data for newly generated weather data. Related metadata will be recorded using standardized formats (e.g., UTC for time-zone data, ISO 19115 for geospatial information). Data Collection or Generation Log Files: Data Collection or Generation Log Files: Comprehensive logs documenting the data collection, processing steps, and analysis procedures will be maintained. Energy datasets will follow the same documentation process as the weather datasets, with additional folder categorization into national-level and site-level data. Metadata for 'Distributed Solar/Wind Systems Physical Characteristics Data' will be maintained together in dedicated .xlsx and .txt files, accompanied by a README file detailing the data structure, variables, and usage guidelines. Finally, trained models and the associated Python scripts for model training and testing will be managed via GitHub. Each repository will include a README.md file outlining the training and testing procedures, and experimental logs documenting digital records of optimal hyperparameters, performance metrics, model weights, and computational times for each tested method.

Scripts and models will be managed using GitHub repositories for version control and stored locally in the project owner's OneDrive folder. Active research data will be stored on the portable HDD for quick access, while archived/inactive data will be compressed and stored on the ELECTA servers with automatic back-up procedures. Both storage solutions are provided and managed by KU Leuven's ICTS. Published data will be made available following the publisher's standards. How will the data be backed up?

Last modiﬁed 16 April 2025 8 of 11 Each commit and push to the GitHub repository automatically backs up the model and script via version control. In addition, OneDrive performs daily backups to the ELECTA network drive, where KU Leuven's ICTS then manages multiple backups each day for both active and archived data. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes For active data, we currently have a 5 TB HDD for storage, while ELECTA server ensures sufficient storage and backup capacity for archived data. As data collection continues, we can expand our capacity using additional resources from KU Leuven's ICTS or Energyville if needed. All solutions are scalable, allowing capacity to be expanded as needed. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The HDD is stored in a locked drawer at the ELECTA office. The network drive is secured by KU Leuven's ICTS service, and access to the owner's OneDrive folders on the ELECTA drive is limited to authorized users only. In addition, the GitHub repositories are managed solely by the author and secured with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
