It focuses on the reconstruction and\nanalysis of human-environment interactions in river valleys to determine the extent to which anthropogenic processes have shaped\npresent-day landscapes. It is framed within the concept of the Anthropocene, a period that underscores the significant influence of\nhuman activity on the landscape.\nThe Anthropocene is often considered to be a new geological period in which humans have altered the landscape significantly. Whilst\nglobal assessments on how important humans have been as geomorphic agents do exist, these are very crude and based on limited\ndata. Furthermore, little is known about the beginnings and evolution of humans as landscape architects at regional and local scales,\nmaking it impossible to understand how anthropogenic current landscapes are. This research project aims to unravel, analyze and\nimprove our understanding of the long-term landscape development of two contrasting regions and their floodplains in particular (Dijle\nand Grote Nete), representative for the European Loess and Coversand Belts. Both were shaped profoundly by human impact but at\ndifferent times, at different rates and with different outcomes.\nThis project combines geomorphological and landscape-historical analyses, quantifying soil mobilization over 10,000 years and\nexamining human-environment relations since the eighteenth century. The project's outcomes are expected to inform governmental and\nnon-governmental organizations involved in rural and floodplain management, while also exploring the potential contribution of cultural\nheritage to sustainable landscape management.\nTo analyse these dynamics, an interdisciplinary approach is adopted that combines geomorphological and historical methods. The data\nsources include LIDAR data, historical maps, archival material, interviews, and other visual records.\nID: \nID: \n214359\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-10-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n30-09-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n09-04-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

For the other types of datasets (statistical calculations, pollen, inventories) there are no international standards concerning metadata available to adhere to. Metadata will be created manually for these sets, resulting in .txt, .xml, .csv or .doc files. These will include settings and technical descriptions.

Shared network drive (J-drive) During the project individual researchers will store and share data, whilst still in the editing/ (re)constructing phase, temporarily on a communal and synchronized BOX folder (100 GB). Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 09 April 2025 5 of 9 Reused datasets along with final newly generated dataset will be stored on the shared drive on the KU Leuven server (300 GB). This shared drive is only accessible to the project members. A part of the data is collected and used by multiple teammembers. An example is the data collected through fieldwork. These data will be stored on the KU Leuven server on the shared drive on the KU Leuven server. This drive mostly contains communal folders concerning shared data, literature and administrative info. Apart from that, two personal subfolders are included in which the data for the two doctoral projects will be stored. These folders are given the name of the doctoral students and are available to all the team members to access. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up?

What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? During the project we will mainly make use of box and a shared KU Leuven projectfolder at no extra cost. It this appears to be insufficient, we will make use of long-term data storage facilitated by ICTS. The expected costs for data storage and back-up have been taken into account in the project budget. So projects funds will cover this. Long-term data storage costs (ICTS L-drive) costs approx 850 euro for 5 TB but the main promotor is sharing such a folder with colleagues. At present, 1 Tb is allocated to the main promotor at an annual cost of 174 euro. This is a small costs for the project budget and should be sufficient during the project.

A selection of soil samples might be stored as well. A number of these will be analysed during the project and will then be discarded. Soil samples that could not be analysed, but are considered relevant, will be stored for a maximum of 5 years. After this period resampling is a better option.

If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. KU Leuven RDR (Research Data Repository) The aim is to make data available for reuse through KU Leuven RDR. Because the project is an interdisciplinary one, data will not be limited to a specific discipline. During the project this question will be re-evaluated to find the best fit for the data that is being generated. An option is to deposit the entire dataset at a general repository like Zenodo or Figshare. Alternatively (parts of) the dataset can be deposited in a subject-specific repository: for example the descriptions of coring and spatial data concerning soils and morphology can be deposited at the DOV (Databank Ondergrond Vlaanderen); the database and spatial data concerning archaeological and historical sites can be made available through the CAI. When will the data be made available? When will the data be made available? Upon publication of research results Unpublished data will be made available 2 years after the end of the project.
