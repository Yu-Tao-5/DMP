Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). The methodology, protocols, and results of all experiments will be described in an electronic lab book (.doc file). Each month, a time-stamped copy of each lab book is generated and stored on KU Leuven servers. New protocols will be stored on a specific folder on a network drive (J:) at KU Leuven. Bacterial strains (WT and generated KOs) and DNA plasmids will be described in an excel file that will also be stored on the network drive.

Last modiﬁed 22 March 2024 6 of 9 All data (time-stamped copies of lab notebooks, images and other digital data) will be stored in a personal folder on a shared network drive (J:) backed up by the ICTS service of the KU Leuven university. Additional copies will be made and stored on personal devices. Once the researcher leaves the lab, their data will be transferred to a large-volume network archive drive. In addition, the LC-MS data will be stored in duplicate on dedicated external hard drives. Bacteria and DNA will be stored in duplicate in -80 and -20°C freezers, respectively.
