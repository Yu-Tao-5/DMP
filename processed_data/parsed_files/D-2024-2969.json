What sets us apart from other primates is that our forelimbs are no\nlonger used in daily locomotor activities. This change in forelimb function is likely related to the shift from an arboreal to terrestrial environment in our\nevolutionary history. But how does this translate to the shoulder? Have these changes in function led to anatomical changes in the human shoulder? Or\nhas the loss of its weight-bearing and locomotor function decreased the selective pressure, allowing a wider variation in anatomy, thereby tolerating\npotentially disadvantageous traits? In this project, we will use state-of-the-art modelling techniques to develop an anatomical and biomechanical\nframework of the human and non-human (NH) primate shoulder. This will allow us to investigate how specific anatomical traits affect forelimb\nfunction in NH primates and compare that to what is observed in modern humans. To achieve a strong integrative approach, we have formed a\nmultidisciplinary team allowing us to apply innovative techniques from engineering and medicine, i.e. musculoskeletal and statistical shape modelling,\nto the field of biological anthropology. Our strong expertise in these domains and our access to a unique digital database of primates puts us in the best\npossible position to embark on this exciting project.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n31-05-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes There is sufficient storage and backup available; whenever needed additional storage space on the university server can be acquired during the course of the project. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Archived imaging data on university server have restricted access. The PI manages who can access these drives. Access to human imaging data (including personal data) is restricted to only a few persons who need access to these data. These data are only available on secured university or hospital servers and cannot be stored in other places or on other devices. Physical data (primate specimens) are stored in freezers in a locked room. For the other data (imaging data of primates) there is a low confidentiality level and there is no need to restrict access. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? yearly cost for data storage at university server = 160 EUR /TB yearly cost for data storage using Dropbox = 576 EUR/4 team members These costs will be covered by the research budget of the PI (Evie Vereecke) 4.

In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). institutional policies...). All data obtained and processed during the project will be retained at least five years after completion of the project. Only primate cadavers will not be stored for a period of five years but will either be incinerated or returned to the institute of origin after completion of the experimental work. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? The data will be stored on secured university servers with automated daily backup. In addition, imaging data will be stored on morphosource.org and source code will be stored on github.
