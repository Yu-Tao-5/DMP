In addition to\ntheoretical contributions, we will demonstrate the practical usefulness of our novel methodology\nthrough various empirical applications to data describing household decisions regarding the\nintrahousehold allocation of time and money.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. General Information\nName of the project lead (PI)\nLaurens Cherchye\nBram De Rock\nFrederic Vermeulen\nInternal Funds Project number & title\nC14/21/010 \"Marriage markets, household consumption and individual welfare\".\n2. Data description\n2.1. Will you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nReuse existing data\n2.2. What data will you collect, generate or reuse? Describe the origin, type and\nformat of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a\nnumbered list or table and per objective of the project.\nMEqIn\nCross-sectional\nmicrodata with\ndetailed\nsocioeconomic and\ndemographic\ninformation on a\nrepresentative sample\nof Belgian households.\n.dta\nLess than\n1 GB\nComputer\nassisted\npersonal\ninterviewing +\ndrop off\nquestionaire.\nLISS\nPanel microdata with\ndetailed\nsocioeconomic and\ndemographic\ninformation on a\nrepresentative sample\nof Dutch households.\n.dta\nDepending\non the\nmodules\nused less\nthan 1 GB\nRepresentative\nonline panel.\nPSID\nPanel microdata with\ndetailed\nsocioeconomic and\ndemographic\ninformation on a\nrepresentative sample\nof American\nhouseholds.\n.dta\nDepending\non the\nmodules\nused less\nthan 1 GB\nVariety of\ninterview modi\nover the years:\ne.g. face to\nface, computer\nassisted\ntelephone\ninterview.\n \n3. Ethical and legal issues\n3.1. Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you\nwill use. Add the reference to the file in KU Leuven's Record of Processing Activities.\nBe aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 4\nData are anonymous social survey data.\n3.2. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s).\nNo.\n3.3. Does your research possibly result in research data with potential for tech\ntransfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If\nso, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo.\n3.4. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the\ndata you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions regarding\nreuse and sharing are in place?\nThe three data sources mentioned can be used for academic research without any restrictions\n(conditional upon registration).\n4. Documentation and metadata\n4.1. What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of the\ndata collected/generated in this project?\n1. MEqIn. General documentation on the original data can be found on\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/meqin/data. Our empirical applications will likely make use of data\ndrawn from the original dataset. All steps from the original data to the sample used for our\nstudies will be carefully documented in a Stata-do-file and/or a readme file.\n2. LISS. General documentation on the original data can be found on https://www.lissdata.nl/. Our\nempirical applications will likely make use of data drawn from the original dataset. All steps from\nthe original data to the sample used for our studies will be carefully documented in a Stata-do-\nfile and/or a readme file.\n3. PSID. General documentation on the original data can be found on\nhttps://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/. Our empirical applications will likely make use of data drawn\nfrom the original dataset. All steps from the original data to the sample used for our studies will\nbe carefully documented in a Stata-do-file and/or a readme file.\n \n4.2. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be\nused. If not, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo.\n5. Data storage and backup during the project\n5.1. Where will the data be stored?\nThe original MEqIn, LISS and PSID data are stored by the three institutions that organized the\ndata. The specific data sets that will used by our research team are stored on internal KU Leuven\nservers (Onedrive) and on Dropbox (given its widespread use among academics). In addition,\nlocal copies can be kept on personal devices.\n \n5.2. How will the data be backed up?\nThe data will be stored on Onedrive (via KU Leuven servers) and Dropbox. The latter has\npermanent back-up facilities. The university's central server also has automatic back-up\nprocedures.\n \n \n5.3. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes. Each dataset that we will use in our empirical applications is relatively small in size (less\nthan 0.1 GB). This does not imply any problem for storage on standard local devices, nor for the\nuniversity servers and Dropbox.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 4\n \n5.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\n The data storage on the university's servers is free. The three main investigators also have a\nsubscription to Dropbox. Per investigator, the total costs are about 500 euro over the course of\nthe project. The costs are covered through the project's funding. We will keep our subscription to\nDropbox after the project given that it is a widely used tool to share data and documents.\n \n5.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not\naccessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nThe original data from MEqIn, LISS and PSID are stored through a secure environment. We refer\nto the respective organizers for details.\n6. Data preservation after the end of the project\n6.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the\nproject? If only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is\nthe case (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll data we intend to use can be stored for at least 10 years.\n6.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures)\nfor at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.\n6.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How\nwill the costs be covered?\nGiven the small size data sets, we do not expect any substantial costs for the storage of the data\nin Dropbox and the university's servers. The expected costs can be easily covered through\nproject funding.\n7. Data sharing and re-use\n7.1. Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data\n(e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions or because of IP\npotential)?\nThe three data sources we intend to use can be freely used by academic researchers for\nnoncommercial use. The only condition is that they need to register. Once this is done, access to\nthe data is granted. From there on, our Stata do files and/or readme files can be consulted to go\nfrom the original data to the specific data used in the various applications.\nMore and more academic journals require that the data sets used for published papers are sent\nto these journals for replication purposes (examples in economics are American Economic\nReview, Economic Journal, Review of Economics & Statistics). In addition, these journals require\nresearchers to send their programs. Of course, we will carefully follow these steps in the\npublication process.\n7.2. Which data will be made available after the end of the project?\nThe final datasets of our respective empirical applications will be made available in Stata (.dta)\nformat. In addition do-files, readme-files and programs will be made available.\n7.3. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nUpon request by mail\n7.4. When will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\n7.5. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nAcademic and policy researchers without commercial motives.\n7.6. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nNegligible costs through Dropbox or mail sharing.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 4\n8. Responsibilities\n8.1. Who will be responsible for the data documentation & metadata?\nLaurens Cherchye, Bram De Rock and Frederic Vermeulen have the final responsibility.\n8.2. Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nLaurens Cherchye, Bram De Rock and Frederic Vermeulen have the final responsibility.\n8.3. Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and sharing?\nLaurens Cherchye, Bram De Rock and Frederic Vermeulen have the final responsibility.\n8.4. Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nLaurens Cherchye, Bram De Rock and Frederic Vermeulen have the final responsibility.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 4"
