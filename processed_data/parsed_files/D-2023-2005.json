Due to their versatile metabolism, non-model organisms (including various\nPseudomonas spp.) qualify as interesting targets for the development of MCFs. Their genomes\nencode a wide variety of secondary metabolites that are applied in different areas of biotechnology.\nHowever, engineering their genomes is complex due to the limited availability of tools and parts that\ncan be used for this purpose. In addition, the mechanisms that drive secondary metabolite\nproduction remain largely unknown, which further complicates pathway optimization and\nengineering.\nIn my PhD project, I implement a state-of-the-art nanopore-based RNA sequencing methodology\n(ONT-cappable-seq) as a basis to solve these limitations. By elucidating the mechanisms that drive\nsecondary metabolite production and by mining bacteriophages for SynBio parts in non-model\norganisms, I will create a proof-of-concept MCF that will serve as a platform for phage-inspired\nbacterial refactoring. In this manner, this project aims to bridge the gap between sustainable\nproduction methods and an increased efficacy of microbial fermentations with industrial potential.\nLast modified: \n19-04-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

(use up to 700 characters)\nExperimental approaches will result in newly generated data, consisting of small datasets like digital images (e.g., .jpg, .tiff, .png) and numerical data (e.g., .xls and .csv), as well as large datasets\nsuch as high-throughput RNA seq (e.g., .fastq) and mass spectrometry (e.g., .d). These experiments will also have associated data such as methods, protocols and lab books (e.g., .docx, .txt, .pdf).\nFurthermore, dissemination of the research will occur through manuscripts and presentations (e.g., .pptx). Data (e.g., DNA sequences and publications in scientific journals) from public databases\n(e.g., PubMed, NCBI) will be (re)used for analysis. Biological data will be reused (e.g., production strains) and new biological data will be generated (e.g., engineered production strains, expression\nvectors).\nSpecify in which way the following provisions are in place in order to preserve the data during and at least 5 years after the end of the research?

A back-up of the drive is made automatically and previous files can be retrieved when current files are damaged. Since the used network\ndrive is suitable to store large datasets at minimal cost, all relevant data will be archived here for a minimum of 10 years (following the RDM policy of KU Leuven). After this time,\nirrelevant versions of digital DNA sequences, digital lab notebooks and experimental datasets will be scrutinized for prolonged storage or disposal.\nWhat’s the reason why you wish to deviate from the principle of preservation of data and of the minimum preservation term of 5 years?

Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Computational data (e.g., sequencing data, MS data, lab books) and biological data stored for at least 10 years according to the KU Leuven RDM policy For both datatypes a selection will be made for data that is either hard/costly to replicate (such as engineered strains and MS data) or has potential future applications (RNA seq data) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Computational data large volume storage drive (K:-drive) of KU Leuven Biological samples In duplicate in 2 different -80°C freezers What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Most of the data will be made available through online repositories, reducing the storage costs to below 1TB/year (<104,42/TB/year) 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in an Open Access repository Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) Sequencing data will be made available through (GEO (NCBI)) Metabolomics data will be made available through (metabolomics workbench (NIH)) Upon request, other data can be shared with interested parties If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Not applicable Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes, Intellectual Property Rights The final engineered bacterial strain can be used for commercial valorization. It can be licensed out to industrial partners for the optimized production of the secondary metabolite. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. RNA sequencing data Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ Metabolomics data Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 19 April 2023 7 of 8 Metabolomics workbench (NIH): https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/ Other metadata for which no specific tools is available can be stored on the KU Leuven RDR platform When will the data be made available? Upon publication of an associated research article. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. Data from the project that can be shared will be made available under a creative commons attribution license (cc-by 4.0), so that users have to give credit to the original data creators. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. Yes Standard, a DOI will be created. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? The proposed repositories don't charge a fee for uploading data 6. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project? Jorien Poppeliers (PhD student), under supervision of Rob Lavigne (PI). Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project? Jorien Poppeliers (PhD student), under supervision of Rob Lavigne (PI). Who will manage data preservation and sharing? Rob Lavigne (PI). Who will update and implement this DMP? Jorien Poppeliers (PhD student), under supervision of Rob Lavigne (PI). Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 19 April 2023 8 of 8"
