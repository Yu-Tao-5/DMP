A typical use of these\nproducts was the pre-treatment of field crop seeds to protect the emerging seedling from aphid feeding, which transmits viruses to the plant, with\nsevere potential yield losses as a consequence. Climate change exacerbates this problem, because even small increases in temperature increase the\nnumber of aphids spreading the disease. As a consequence, substantial yield losses are predicted in the EU. Growing resistant varieties is the most\nsustainable way to avoid such yield losses. Here we propose to apply a novel biochemical approach to identify virus susceptibility factors.\nSusceptibility factors are those plant factors that are hijacked by the virus to infect, replicate and spread in the plant. By inactivating or modifying these\nfactors, the plant can be brought outside of the host range of the virus. Because most plant viruses consist of an RNA genome, plant susceptibility\nfactors often have the capacity to physically interact with RNA. Therefore, we propose to identify the RNA binding proteins that physically interact\nwith the viral genome in vivo. Identifying such proteins based on their capability to interact with RNA has become possible through recent\ndevelopments in the RNA-protein field and in the Geuten group these methods have been combined into new purification strategies and applied to\nplants. The identification of virus susceptibility genes is of general interest to sustainable agriculture.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n11-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Yes For the MS data, PDBx/mmCIF will be used. This is the standard archive format used by the Protein Data Bank (PDB). It provides both metadata and data according to properties defined in the PDB Exchange Dictionary and the Macromolecular Crystallographic Information Framework (mmCIF). 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? All data is stored on the cloud service of KULeuven, OneDrive for Business cloud system (2 TB of storage capacity). Key experiments/datasets/protocols are also stored/shared on the Lab's teams channel. Copies are kept on personal devices provided by KULeuven and running on LUNA software. The generated MS data will be deposited in a corresponding database, e.g. PRIDE. Physical samples for long- time storage are stored in the -80°C freezer, an online database shared on 'Teams' provides information about these samples. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? The data will be stored at OneDrive for Business cloud system (2 TB of storage capacity), a service provided by the university, which automatically synchronizes the data everyday. A back-up of key datasets is available at 'teams'. For large datasets such as mass Created using DMPonline.be.
