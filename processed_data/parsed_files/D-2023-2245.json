General Project Information  Name Grant Holder & ORCID Adelheid Soubry, PI ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2330-7171 Contributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Cathrine Hoyo, coPI MyBibliography: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/myncbi/cathrine.hoyo.1/collections/47799156/public/ Project number 1 & title Paternal Origins of Health and Disease Funder(s) GrantID 2 G0C8523N Affiliation(s) x KU Leuven  ☐ Universiteit Antwerpen ☐ Universiteit Gent  ☐ Universiteit Hasselt ☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  xOther: NC State University, USA ROR identifier KU Leuven: 05f950310 \n 1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number. This question is optional.

However, our recent findings suggest that a father’s environment before conception matters as well. This runs counter to standard thinking about heredity that parents pass down only genes to their children. An equally plausible way to leave a mark on offspring is through epigenetic inheritance. This refers to molecular modifications to genes that may persist through fertilization and further development. These modifications can be a response to environmental influences by silencing some genes and activating others. Striking evidence from animal experiments show that phenotypic changes may persist for multiple generations.  The aim of the current research proposal is to define the role of one particular subgroup of molecules of this epigenetic system: small ncRNA molecules. Little is known about their function in paternal heredity in human. Therefore, we will: 1/ identify ncRNAs involved in sperm-to-oocyte inheritance; 2/ define how specific paternal exposures may influence these processes and potentially affect offspring's health. Our first exposure of interest is paternal obesity, but applications are divers. Our research will open new opportunities in several areas, including the fertility clinic, public health, and evolutionary and social sciences.           \n FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven       3  2.
