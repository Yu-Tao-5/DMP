Among detainees, there are\nsignificant differences in the proficiency of the official languages in Belgium (Dutch, French and German). This project will study language legislation,\npolicy and practice in Belgian prisons, to map to what extent it impairs the detention process and successful reintegration of prisoners into society. By\ncombining an ethnographic study in situ, with a legal analysis of the European human rights law framework, the project will not only show how\nlanguage practices impact reintegration trajectories, but also identify priorities for policy change. Hence, the project will produce a normative\nframework and policy recommendations that are relevant to all 46 Council of Europe member states.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n11-03-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
