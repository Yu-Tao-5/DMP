Starting form five narratives written by contemporary Peruvian\nauthors (Bayly, Bryce Echenique, Cueto, Roncagliolo, and Vargas Llosa), we will analyse how the (trans)national images outlined in the originals\nevolve in the translations  into hypercentral, central and peripheral languages (respectively English, French, and Dutch) as well as, from an\n“intersemiotic” viewpoint, into cinematographic adaptations. By connecting these aspects to the reception of the corresponding works in the\naforementioned literary systems,  the project aims to demonstrate how the transnational projection all these writers share is perceived in a transnational\ncontext. This perspective will shed light on the position of Peruvian literature in the broader literary system as well as on the dynamics between the\ncultures involved in the intercultural transfer.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n18-03-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
