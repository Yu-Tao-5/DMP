The first work package studies the demand for\n(company) cars in Belgium. I focus on the differential effects of taxing fossil fuels, or imposing\nfuel efficiency standards. On top of that, I allow for a large extent of heterogeneity by allowing\ndifferent types of consumers (company car vs no company car) . The second project focuses on\nanticompetitive behavior in the world oil market. This part aims to understand how the global\nmarkup found in the oil industry would interact with a global carbon tax, and its effect on total\nemission and redistributional consequences. The findings of this analysis can be linked to the\nParis Agreement goals to reduce global fossil fuel emissions. Third, I study the Belgian electricity\nmarket. More precisely, I aim to understand how the lack of international integration of the EU\nelectricity market affects the overall efficiency of the sector, and how it has affected the impact\nof a carbon tax on electricity prices.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. General Information\nName applicant\nCharlotte De Cannière\nFWO Project Number & Title\nFWO Project Title: Fueling the Road to Zero: Environmental Policy Evaluation with Multiple Market\nFailures\nFWO Project Number: 1112122N\nAffiliation\nKU Leuven\n2. Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nReuse existing data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nThe different work packages of the project use different types of (confidential) data sets from\nmarketing organizations (JATO Dynamics, Rystad energy) and government agencies (Belgian\nCommission for the Regulation of Electricity and Gas (CREG)).  The table below gives an\noverview.\nType of data\nFormat\nSize\nHow created\nautomobiles\n.csv\n5-15 GB\nObtained from JATO\noil production\n.csv\n10-25 GB\nObtained from Rystad\nEnergy\nelectricity\nproduction\n.csv\n5-15 GB\nObtained from CREG\n \nThe first dataset consists of demand volumes and prices in different countries over multiple\nperiods (years or quarters).  The second dataset covers production and cost data from worldwide\noil assets at the yearly level. The third dataset contains production and cost data from the\nBelgian production fleet of electricity.\nThe datasets will not combined across the three parts, but within each part they will be merged\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 4\nwith publicly available variables (such as population, income, PPI, or energy forecast variables).\nStatistical software packages, such as Stata and Matlab, are used to manage the data and\nestimate econometric models. This generates tables with aggregate summary statistics and\nmodel parameter estimates, as well as figures and graphs to illustrate the findings.\n3. Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNo\nPrivacy Registry Reference: NA\nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used:\nNone of the three work packages use individual-level personal data. For the automobile project, I\nwill use data on car purchases on the town-level in Belgium. This dataset will be complemented\nby publicly available datasets with town-level characteristics (average household income,\nemployment rate, etc.).  Given this aggregation, the researcher will be unable to identify\nhousehold on an individual basis.\n \nAll other project involve production data, rather than personal data.\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nNo\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nYes\nThe confidentiality agreements with JATO Dynamics, Rystad Energy and CREG do not allow me to\npublicly share the data sets. They can only be accessed by collaborating researchers who\nobtained permission.\nAll collaborators are aware of the confidentiality agreements, and work on a secure server.\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\n1. The underlying data are not created by myself. Therefore, they are documented by the\norganizations that created them.\n2. I documents the statistical code with comments. Furthermore, I keep track of a readme file\nthat describes how the different programs are related in the various steps of the analysis (data\nmanagement including sample selection and variable creation; statistical and econometric\nanalysis; production of tables and figures).\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nThere is no need for this because each part of the project makes use of existing datasets from\nexternal sources and has a relatively simple structure.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 4\nI already carefully document the data management, and statistical and econometric analysis in\nthe code and readme files, as decribed earlier. \n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nThe data sets are stored on the KU Leuven servers, except for the part on electricity production,\nwhich is stored on the CREG servers. The FEB ICT department provides regular backups. \nFor collaboration with other researchers from other research untis, we will use DropBox for active\nuse of the data during the project.\n \n \nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers with automatric daily back-up\nprocedures. Servers and PC's are managed by ICT department of FEB according to latest security\nnorms, to rule out loss of data.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThe total storage is estimated around 60GB. There is sufficient storage capacity on servers and\nPCs both during and after the research.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nThe core storage is provided by the readily available powerful server computer of  FEB ICT.\nTo provide the active use of the datasets in Dropbox, I will use the FWO benchfee ( Dropbox Plus-\n3 TB storage - 120€/year).\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nServers and PCs are managed by the ICT department of FEB, according to latest security norms.\nData can be stored encrypted. Data sets van only accessed by researchers that obtained\npermission. \n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\n1. The raw datasets will be retained by JATO Dynamics, Rystad Energy and CREG indefinitely, and\nwill be kept on KU Leuven servers for at least 10 years, except for\nThe electricity data, as it is stored on the CREG servers, instead of the KU Leuven servers\nbecause of contractual restrictions.\n2. The statistical programs/code and the documentation will also be maintained for at least 10\nyears, and in principle indefinitely, as they are very small in storage size. The statistical\nprograms/code will also be made publicly accessible.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nIf contractually allowed (as mentioned in the previous question), the data and statistical\nprograms/code will be stored on the KU Leuven servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for\nat least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nThe costs are negligible because the infrastructure is already available. \n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 4\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nYes. Specify:\nThe agreements with JATO Dynamics, Rystad Energy and CREG do not allow me to publicly share\nthe data sets. They can only be accessed by researchers that obtained their permission.\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\n1. The code will be made publicly accessible.\n2. The agreements with Rystad Energy, JATO Dynamics, and CREG do not allow me to share the\ndata sets publicly. They can only be accessed by researchers who obtained permission.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nUpon request by mail\nOther (specify):\nData sets can be accessed by researchers who obtained permission, and the code is made\npublicly accessible through journals or author's website, or on request.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nImmediately after the end of the project\nUpon publication of the research results\nData sets can only be accessed by researchers who obtained permission, and will not be shared\nby the researcher.
