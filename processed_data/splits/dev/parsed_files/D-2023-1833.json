The interviews will be audio -recorded, and which will be \ntranscribed verbatim by the PI (Femke Geusens). After transcribing the audio files, she will re -listen to the interviews \nto ensure that the transcriptions are complete and accurate. These transcriptions will be used for data analysis. The \nfiles will be named the pseudonym of the participant + the data the interview was conducted (e.g., \nFemke_20230109). Each pa rticipant's transcript will be stored in a separate file. Audiofiles will be deleted after \ntranscription, so only the pseudonymized transcripts remain in existence.  \nstudy 2: panel data  \nThe longitudinal panel study will be embedded in the running Mom2B stud y. These data are survey data with \nmeasures at four time points.  \n \n \nWhat is the purpose of the data generation or re -use and its relation to the objectives of the project?  \n \nstudy 1: interview data  \nThe interview data will be used to answer three research que stions:  \n● How do women with pregnancy -related anxiety make sense of and experience the different types of content \nthey encounter on YouTube?  \n● How do they deal with potential unreliability of this content?  \n● Which specific content do they seek and avoid, dependi ng on which needs they are trying to fulfill?  \nThese research questions correspond to the first objective of the project: To understand how pregnancy - and \nchildbirth -related content on YouTube can fulfill different needs for women with pregnancy -related anx iety. \nstudy 2: panel data  \nThe longitudinal panel data will be used to answer three research questions:  \n● Which underlying mechanisms explain how exposure to pregnancy - and childbirth -related YouTube content \naffects pregnancy -related anxiety?  \n● Do different types of content result in different effects via different processes?  \n● To what extend is the association between pregnancy -related anxiety and seeking pregnancy - and \nchildbirth -related content on YouTube transactional  \nThese research questions correspond to the first objective of the project: To elucidate the underlying processes of the \nassociation between exposure to pregnancy - and childbirth -related content and pregnancy -related anxiety.  \n \n \nWhat is the expected size of the data that you intend to generate or  re-use?  \nFemke G eusens   Project PACMUM  \n \nstudy 1: interview data  \nWe expect to interview between 20 and 50 participants, depending on when theoretical saturation is reached. Each \ninterview is expected to last between 30 and 60 minutes. MP3 audio files are typically up to 150 MB per hour,  \nmeaning that the total size of our audio files should be no more than 10 GB. Transcripts of a one -hour interview are \ntypically around 100 -150 KB, meaning that the total size of the transcripts should be less than 10 MB.  \nstudy 2: panel data  \n \nWe will recrui t approximately 1000 participants, using measurements at 4 time points. A dataset of this size is \napproximately 15 MB as a .sav file (usable in SPSS).  \n \n \n \nWhat is the origin/provenance of the data, either generated or re -used?  \n \nAll data is generated for thi s study  \n \n \nTo whom might your data be useful ('data utility'), outside your project?  \n \nData might be useful to other researchers studying maternal mental health, as well as healthcare providers and \nintervention specialists working around maternal mental heal th. \n \n \n \nFAIR DATA  \n \n2.1.    Making data findable, including provisions for metadata: Will data be identified by a persistent \nidentifier?  \n \nPseudonymized or anonymized data linked to published articles will be made available on OSF, as well as a \ndescription of  the data analysis (e.g., syntax and output files for quantitative data analysis). The OSF project page will \nbe identified by a persistent identifier.  No identifiable data will be shared or stored on OSF . \n \n \n2.1.    Making data findable, including provisions for metadata: Will rich metadata be provided to allo w \ndiscovery? What metadata will be created? What disciplinary or general standards will be followed? In case \nmetadata standards do not exist in your discipline, please outline what type of metadata will be created and \nhow.  \n \nYes, we will follow the DDI (Dat a Documentation Initiative) standard, which is an international standard for describing \ndata from the social, behavioral, and economic sciences.  \n \n \n2.1.    Making data findable, including provisions for metadata:  Will search keywords be provided in the \nmeta data to optimize the possibility for discovery and then potential re -use?  \n \nyes \n \n \n2.1.    Making data findable, including provisions for metadata:  Will metadata be offered in such a way that it \ncan be harvested and indexed?  \n \nNo \n \n \n2.2. Making data accessible  - Repository: Will the data be deposited in a trusted repository?  \n \nYes, pseudonymized or anonymized data linked to published articles will be made available on OSF, as well as a \ndescription of the data analysis (e.g., syntax and output files for quantitat ive data analysis). The OSF project page will \nbe identified by a persistent identifier.  No identifiable data will be shared or stored on OSF .  \nFemke G eusens   Project PACMUM  \n \n \n2.2. Making data accessible - Repository: Have you explored appropriate arrangements with the identified \nrepository where your data will be deposited?  \n \nEveryone can c reate a project page on OSF where they can deposit their data. I already have an account on OSF \nand have used them in the past.  \n \n \n2.2. Making data accessible - Repository: Does the repository ensure that the data is assigned an identifier? \nWill the repository resolve the identifier to a digital object?  \n \nOn OSF, you can ch oose whether the data is assigned an identifier.  \n \n \n2.2.    Making data accessible - Data:  \nWill all data be made openly available? If certain datasets cannot be shared (or need to be shared under \nrestricted access conditions), explain why, clearly separating legal and contractual reasons from intentional \nrestrictions. Note that in multi -benefici ary projects it is also possible for specific beneficiaries to keep their \ndata closed if opening their data goes against their legitimate interests or other constraints as per the Grant \nAgreement.  \n \nOnly pseudonymized or anonymized data will be made openly available. While the project is running, data will only be \nmade available in smaller datasets containing only the variables used in specific papers, so as to give the research \nteam the benefit of being the first to use their own data as a whole to test the ir hypotheses and explore their research \nquestions. Once the project has finished and the hypotheses and research questions are answered, the full \n(pseudonymized or anonymized) dataset will be made available upon reasonable request.  \n \n \n2.2.    Making data a ccessible - Data:  \nIf an embargo is applied to give time to publish or seek protection of the intellectual property (e.g. patents), \nspecify why and how long this will apply, bearing in mind that research data should be made available as \nsoon as possible.  \n \nSmaller datasets containing only the variables used in specific papers will be made available as soon as the paper is \nsubmitted for review.  \n \n \n2.2.    Making data accessible - Data:  \nWill the data be accessible through a free and standardized access protoco l? \n \nYes, smaller datasets containing only the variables used in specific articles will be made available for free on OSF. \nThe full dataset will be made available upon reasonable request, after a research plan has been approved by the \nresearchers.  \n \n \n2.2.    Making data accessible - Data:  \nIf there are restrictions on use, how will access be provided to the data, both during and after the end of the \nproject?  \n \nA data sharing agreement will be drawn up and signed by both parties when providing access to the data set. The \nsmaller datasets made available during the project will include a statement that the data is only allowed to be used for \nscientific purposes.  \n \n \n2.2.    Making data accessible - Data:  \n \nHow will the identity of the person accessing the data be ascertained?  \n \nWhen the data are deposited in an open repository such as OSF, the identity of the person accessing the data cannot \nbe ascertained. This is why no identifying data will be made available in these files. When access to the full dataset is \nrequested, researchers will have to propose an research plan for which they want to use the data. This will allow us to \nFemke G eusens   Project PACMUM  \nascertain that the individual requesting access to the data is indeed a researcher. The anonymized dataset will then \nbe shared with them usi ng an individual link over a secure server.  \n \n \n2.2.    Making data accessible - Data:  \n \nIs there a need for a data access committee (e.g. to evaluate/approve access requests to personal/sensitive \ndata)?  \n \nNo, the PI can evaluate and approve access requests si nce the data will all be anonymized.  \n \n \n2.2.    Making data accessible - Metadata:  \n \nWill metadata be made openly available and licenced under a public domain dedication CC0, as per the Grant \nAgreement? If not, please clarify why. Will metadata contain infor mation to enable the user to access the \ndata?  \n \nYes \n \n \n2.2.    Making data accessible - Metadata:  \n \nHow long will the data remain available and findable? Will metadata be guaranteed to remain available after \ndata is no longer available?  \n \nData will remain avai lable and findable for 10 years. OSF guarantees availability of the metadata for 50 years.  \n \n \n2.2.    Making data accessible - Metadata:  \nWill documentation or reference about any software be needed to access or read the data be included? Will it \nbe possible to include the relevant software (e.g. in open source code)?  \n \nSPSS will be needed to read the datasets, syntaxes and outputs.  \n \n \n2.3.    Making data interoperable:  \nWhat data and metadata vocabularies, standards, formats or methodologies will you follow to make your \ndata interoperable to allow data exchange and re -use within and across disciplines? Will you follow \ncommunity -endorsed interoperability best practices? Which ones?  \n \nA measurement binder with the original citation of the validated scales , as well as the specific items and answer \noptions will be provided.  \n \n \n2.3.    Making data interoperable:  \nIn case it is unavoidable that you use uncommon or generate project specific ontologies or vocabularies, will \nyou provide mappings to more commonly u sed ontologies? Will you openly publish the generated \nontologies or vocabularies to allow reusing, refining or extending them?  \n \nnot applicable  \n \n \n2.3.    Making data interoperable:  \nWill your data include qualified references[1] to other data (e.g. other da ta from your project, or datasets \nfrom previous research)?  \n  \n[1]A qualified reference is a cross -reference that explains its intent. For example, X is regulator of Y is a \nmuch more qualified reference than X is associated with Y, or X see also Y. The goal therefore is to create as \nmany meaningful links as possible between (meta)data resources to enrich the contextual knowledge about \nthe data.

Increase data re -use: \n \nFurther to the FAIR principles, DMPs should also address research outputs other than data, and should \ncarefully consider aspects related to the allocation of resources, data security and ethical aspects.  \n \nThe only other research output that c an be reused is the interview guide which will be used for the semi -structured \ninterviews. This interview guide will be shared on OSF.  \n \n \n \nOTHER RESEARCH OUTPU TS \n \nIn addition to the management of data, beneficiaries should also consider and plan for the man agement of \nother research outputs that may be generated or re -used throughout their projects. Such outputs can be \neither digital (e.g. software, workflows, protocols, models, etc.) or physical (e.g. new materials, antibodies, \nreagents, samples, etc.).  \n \nThe only other research output that can be reused is the interview guide which will be used for the semi -structured \ninterviews. This interview guide will be shared on OSF.  \n \nFemke G eusens   Project PACMUM  \n \nBeneficiaries should consider which of the questions pertaining to FAIR data above, c an apply to the \nmanagement of other research outputs, and should strive to provide sufficient detail on how their research \noutputs will be managed and shared, or made available for re -use, in line with the FAIR principles.  \n \nThe only other research output t hat can be reused is the interview guide which will be used for the semi -structured \ninterviews.

Both are encrypted, you need authentication procedures to reach them, few have access and access is revised every year, data are always pseudo -anonymized and code keys are kept in totally different servers, data are backed -up re gularly. The smaller anonymous datasets made available on OSF. OSF is a trusted repositorywhich assigns every project, component, and file a short url that is globally unique and whose persistence is guaranteed by a data preservation fund currently suffici ent to provide 50+ years of public access. DATA SECURITY What provisions are or will be in place for data security (including data recovery as well as secure storage/archiving and transfer of sensitive data)? We use BIANCA , UPPMAX and VESTA to securely store our data. All three are encrypted, you need authentication procedures to reach them, few have access and access is revised every year, data are always pseudo -anonymized and code keys are kept in totally different servers, data are backed -up regularly. ETHIC S Are there, or could there be, any ethics or legal issues that can have an impact on data sharing? These can also be discussed in the context of the ethics review.
