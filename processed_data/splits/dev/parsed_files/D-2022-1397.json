Data description\n2.1. Will you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\n2.2. What data will you collect, generate or reuse? Describe the origin, type and\nformat of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a\nnumbered list or table and per objective of the project.\n1\n. \nImages for training data set for neural networks. This is part of the actual research work in\nan interative cycle. All images are generated by computer programs (global illumination\nrenderers), so images are generated as needed on-the-fly.

Ethical and legal issues\n3.1. Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you\nwill use. Add the reference to the file in KU Leuven's Record of Processing Activities.\nBe aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNA\n \n3.2.

If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s).\nNA\n \n3.3.

If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions regarding\nreuse and sharing are in place?\nNo.\n \n4. Documentation and metadata\n4.1. What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of the\ndata collected/generated in this project?\nAll data will consist of computer-geenrated images or computer program code.\nThe images are generated using implemented algorithms, and therefore, the desciription of how\nthe images are generated is contained in the computer code.
