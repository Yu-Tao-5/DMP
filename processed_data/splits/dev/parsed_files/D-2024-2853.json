Screening met een genpanel test kan een diagnose stellen bij 48%, 26%, en 63% van de patiënten\nmet een defect in bloedplaatjesvorming en -functie en in coagulatie, respectievelijk, terwijl bij slechts 3% van de patiënten met bloedingen van\nongekende etiologie een diagnose gesteld werd. Als er een genetisch defect gevonden wordt, duurt het vaak nog jaren alvorens de ziekte echt begrepen\nis omdat er geen cel-gebaseerde modellen voorhanden zijn. Onze studie zal zich richten op deze tekortkomingen door gebruik te maken van genomen\ndie al beschikbaar zijn voor patiënten zonder diagnose uit de 4 groepen vermeld. Deze data zullen aangevuld worden met genexpressie profielen uit\nbloedplaatjes, neutrofielen, monocyten, T cellen en Blood Outgrowth Endothelial Cells (BOEC) en het plasma proteoom van deze patiënten.\nGenexpressie en splicing zal bestudeerd worden met behulp van machine-learning technieken om de detectie van (niet)coderende varianten te\nbevorderen. Functionele studies in BOEC-culturen en het plasma proteoom zullen voor het eerst gebruikt worden voor de karakterisatie van patiënten\nmet bloedingen van ongekende etiologie. BOEC en stamcel afgeleide modellen zullen ook gebruikt worden om nieuwe genen te valideren. Dit project\ngaat bijdragen tot nieuwe inzichten voor bloedingen en de modellen kunnen gebruikt worden voor therapeutische ontdekkingen.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n10-10-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
