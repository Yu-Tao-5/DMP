Additionally, new technologies and trends are emerging, e.g., micro consolidation centers,\nsidewalk robots, autonomous vehicles, synchromodality, etc.\nThese trends generate a myriad of difficult intertwined strategic and operational decision problems. Currently, however, the optimization and\nsimulation tools required to support decision-making in such a complex environment are (1) disjointed and scattered across the scientific literature, or\n(2) not mature enough to adequately handle emerging urban logistic trends. To bridge this gap in the literature, and to aid cities and supply chain actors\nin modelling and optimizing the supply chains, we propose to develop a comprehensive and complementary suite of urban logistics optimization\nalgorithms for “the” city. These problems of optimizing urban supply chains are typically large-scale, multi-level and multi-objective. In order to\nappropriately model and solve these problems, significant advances in operations research techniques are required.\nThey will ultimately contribute to improving the understanding of the impact of new technologies, trends, and policies for all urban logistics\nstakeholders, and support their decisions towards a more sustainable city.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n23-05-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes The research codes, models and algorithms might have the potential for commercial valorization. We work with open source licenses with the restriction that everyone who uses our data or tools/code must also make their tools/code or data available open source as well. For commercial use or other use types that are excluded from the open-source license, the license needs to be negotiated with KUL/LRD.

If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. Yes The data provided by the companies or cities will probably be confidential and cannot be shared with other researchers without permission from the data owners. Still, specific (benchmark) instances might be made available for other researchers to verify our work and to build further on or improve our work.

Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). Re-used data will either refer to the original source or a relevant copy will be uploaded to the KU Leuven data management tool, which has required meta-data documentation fields. Relevant code (including README files) will be stored on one-drive and made available via websites (such as https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/cib/op) or in git-lab and will be documented according to documentation standards and the available time of the researcher to improve re-usability.

If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. make the data easier to find and reuse. Yes Whenever relevant and appropriate, RDR, the data management tool of KU Leuven will be used. It has such a standard. For code, standard practice concerning readability and documentation will be used. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? The data will be stored on the research computer of the researcher, with a back up at the internal storage drives of the research group. Cloud services, such as KU Leuven OneDrive will be used as well. Gitlab is used for code. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? The internal drive of the research group provided by the department is used as a backup, this drive has an auto backup. For code, gitlab works with version control. So if necesarry, a rollback to a previous version of the code can be made as well. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes KUL OneDrive and Gitlab quota are sufficient for the entire project. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Security checks are in line with KU Leuven regulations (e.g. dual factor authentication for accessing all platforms where data is shared, such as gitlab, teams, onedrive,...). Some platforms, such as gitlab, furthermore use leveled access. This makes it impossible for non-authorised to access these files. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? No additional cost are expected 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). institutional policies...). The benchmark instance data will be retained. KU Leuven research data management policy stipulates that all relevant data generated are retained for a period of minimally 10 years after the end of the project. This will be followed. The GitLab repository of the group including all the developed codes stays intact irrespective of people finishing their research and moving on to other projects. All data related to publications will necessarily be retained along with other important unpublished data. The possibility of publication of open-source tools as formal publications with permanent public identifier is currently being examined for other packages in the Created using DMPonline.be.

Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? After the research is concluded, the data will be kept at RDR as well as the internal storage drive of the research group and the gitlab. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The stored data volume is assumed to be small enough to not incur additional costs. 5. Data sharing and reuse 5.

Along with each publication, relevant code and data will be made public. Under the code of open science, all relevant data that can be shared will be shared, to increase verifiability and reproducibility of the methods and their conclusions.
