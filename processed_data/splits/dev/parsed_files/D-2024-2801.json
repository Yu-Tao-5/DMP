Crucial for reducing cancer mortality is\nthe field of cancer diagnostics, especially the early recognition and treatment of cases. However, state-of-the-art early detection\nstrategies still rely on identifying and detecting biomarkers (such as those carried by cancerous cells) using matching bioreceptors, which\nsignificantly hampers progress in cancer diagnostics and research. To circumvent this necessity, microwave dielectric sensing (MDS) has\nemerged as a biomarker-free method for cell detection. Nevertheless, the MDS technology is still at an early stage in the application field\nwith many MDS systems being designed in a non-optimal way. Therefore, this project aims to develop a next-generation microwave-\nmicrofluidic technology platform capable of high-throughput biomarker/label-free detection and retrieval of individual cancer cells.\nInnovative microfluidic solutions, such as microwell arrays and heat-responsive hydrogels will be implemented together with MDS\ntechnology to create a fully integrated platform for differentiating cancerous from healthy cells and retrieval of those cells of interest. The\nresults of this project will challenge existing concepts in the way individual cells are being analyzed and as such will have a significant\nimpact on cancer research next to many other fields.  \nLast modified: \n19-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Last modiﬁed 19 April 2024\n5 of 10\nIf you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL\netc.) per dataset or data type:\nNA\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals,\ndual use)? Describe these issues in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when\nappropriate.\nYes, human subject data\nThree types of human samples will be used: (i) Two human cell lines (MCF7 and MCF10A), and (ii) Patient cancer tissue\nsamples. The ethical approval for the human cell lines is granted (EC UZ Leuven, S66605). The ethical\naproval for the patient samples will be obtained the latest by the fourth year of the FWO-SB project.\nWill you process personal data? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use in the comment section.\nPlease refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate.\nNo\nDoes your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial\nexploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nYes\nIf research data have potential for patent filing, scientific staff working on this project will discuss this with the IOF manager in the\ngroup (Dr.\nFrancesco Dal Dosso) and LRD to make sure that data are protected prior publications.\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data\ntransfer agreements/ research collaboration agreements)?

If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and which restrictions will be\nasserted.\nYes\nDue to the generation of IP, restrictions in data sharing might potentially be implemented. This will be followed up through regular\nmeetings with KU Leuven LRD, who will evaluate and protect potential IP generated during the project that could lead to\nvalorization actions. In this case, IP will (i) not be shared, (ii) put under embargo, or (iii) a suitable license will be applied to the\ndata when published (e.g. Creative Commons License).\n2. Documentation and Metadata\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 19 April 2024\n6 of 10\nClearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data\nunderstandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and\ntypes required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information\nis recorded).\nThe Biosensors group uses the electronic lab notebook in which a number of predetermined topics have to be described for each\nexperiment (objective, protocol, results, and conclusion). The electronic lab notebook facilitates searching for particular metadata\nthrough a search engine. By mimicking the folder structure of the electronic lab notebook in the server-based folder with the\nexperimental data, linking of the metadata to the actual data will be facilitated.\nAs a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that support FAIR data\nsharing (www.fairsharing.org). When depositing data in a local or public repository, the final dataset will be accompanied by this\ninformation in a README.txt document, following the Dublin Core Metadata standard if no other meta- tandard is available yet.\nThis file will be located in the top-level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-\nnaming convention used. This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value\nto the dataset for future reuse.\nFor each peer-reviewed article, a separate folder will be made on the server, containing the latest Word version and all raw and\nprocessed data used in the article. In addition, a separate file will be made in the electronic lab notebook for each article,\ncontaining clickable links to all metadata files of data that were used in that particular article, to facilitate tracing back of protocols,\nresults and conclusions.\nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate\nper dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or\ndata type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.\nYes\nTo guarantee reusable aspect of data, sufficient documentation and methods information will be provided, whereas CC-BY\nlicense will be attached to data through data repositories.\n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nThe time-stamped digital data will be stored on OneDrive and is backed up to both the shared network drive (J-drive) of the KU\nLeuven and Sharepoint. Large data is stored in the large volume storage K-drive of the KU Leuven. The time-stamped digital\nmetadata will be stored on the server of the electronic labbook (eLABJournal, Bio-ITech). Physical samples will be stored in\nfridges and freezers located in the respective laboratories or liquid nitrogen tanks managed at the departmental level. All samples\nwill be tracked using electronic lab notebook (Biosensors group).\nHow will the data be backed up?\nStandard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nDuring, as well as after the project, KU Leuven can provide sufficient storage and backup capacity. A dedicated folder is made for\nthe project to store data files.\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 19 April 2024\n7 of 10\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nThe network drive for the project shared folder and the large volume storage folder are secured by the ICTS service of KU Leuven\nwith a mirror copy. Confidential data can and will be protected with a password (available only for PI Jeroen Lammertyn). Visitors,\nMSc thesis students and internship students in the groups as well as other unauthorized persons will not have access to the data\non the shared folder. Data storage in the cloud will be avoided, unless for temporary use only, e.g., to transfer large files between\nthe researchers involved in the project.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nType 1 server back-end storage with mirror backup for the project shared folder will be used. Using the shared network drive (J-\ndrive) and large volume storage (K-drive) cost respectively 503.66 Euro per TB per year and 104.42 Euro per TB per year. Costs\nwill first be covered by the project consumables budget.\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are\napplicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g.\nlegal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\nThe following data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy:\nDissemination data (source files of publications and presentations) and the most relevant measurement data.\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nOn the shared networks drive (J-drive), Large volume storage (K-drive) and KU Leuven RDR.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be\ncovered?\nThe volume corresponding to dissemination data is expected to be relatively low (<100 GB), and therefore can be seamlessly\nembedded on the (K:) drive of KU Leuven. The costs (1000 EUR/year) will be covered by other on-going projects at that\npoint in time.\nFor research data, at current archiving costs of 10 Euro/(TB*year), we estimate a cost of 2000 Euro/year. These costs will be\ncovered by funding acquired by the project PIs in the context of other research projects.\n \n5. Data sharing and reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  In the comment section please\nexplain per dataset or data type which data will be made available.\nYes, in an Open Access repository\nOnly researchers participating in the project will be able to access the data for the duration of the project. As soon as the article\nassociated with the data is ready for publication, the data will be made open through the institutional repositories mentioned in\n2.1. The data will be deposited in the institutional repositories: (KU Leuven: Research Data Repository (RDR) \nResearch Data\nRepository (RDR) - RDR - Research Data Repository (kuleuven.be)\n. Data will be assigned with DOIs to create trustworthy and\npersistent links for online content.\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 19 April 2024\n8 of 10\nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.\nNA\nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd\nparty, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nYes, Intellectual Property Rights\nBefore making data and other research output from the project (e.g. journal articles, book chapters and conference proceedings)\nopenly available, they will be aligned with the project IP strategy to avoid premature disclosure, which can compromise the patent\nfiling application(s).\nWhere will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.\nKU Leuven RDR (Research Data Repository)\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nWhich data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why.\nData from the project that can be shared will be made available under a creative commons attribution license (cc-by 4.0), so that\nusers have to give credit to the original data creators.\nDo you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide\nit in the comment section.\nYes\nData will be assigned with DOIs to create trustworthy and persistent links for online content.\nORCID will be included in all publications and other dissemination material for all the researchers involved in the project.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nA restricted access repository can be implemented on a free tool, such as OneDrive, up to a certain volume. If this volume does\nnot suffice, time-limited storage will be considered, thus limited to the time needed to download the data. The costs associated\nwith data storage will be covered by the budget foreseen in the project agreement.\n6.

The time-stamped digital data will be stored on OneDrive and is backed up to both the shared network drive (J-drive) of the KU Leuven and Sharepoint. Large data is stored in the large volume storage K-drive of the KU Leuven. The time-stamped digital metadata will be stored on the server of the electronic labbook (eLABJournal, Bio-ITech). Physical samples will be stored in fridges and freezers located in the respective laboratories or liquid nitrogen tanks managed at the departmental level. All samples will be tracked using electronic lab notebook (Biosensors group). How will the data be backed up? Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes During, as well as after the project, KU Leuven can provide sufficient storage and backup capacity. A dedicated folder is made for the project to store data files. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 19 April 2024 7 of 10 How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The network drive for the project shared folder and the large volume storage folder are secured by the ICTS service of KU Leuven with a mirror copy. Confidential data can and will be protected with a password (available only for PI Jeroen Lammertyn). Visitors, MSc thesis students and internship students in the groups as well as other unauthorized persons will not have access to the data on the shared folder. Data storage in the cloud will be avoided, unless for temporary use only, e.g., to transfer large files between the researchers involved in the project. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Type 1 server back-end storage with mirror backup for the project shared folder will be used. Using the shared network drive (J- drive) and large volume storage (K-drive) cost respectively 503.66 Euro per TB per year and 104.42 Euro per TB per year. Costs will first be covered by the project consumables budget. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). The following data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy: Dissemination data (source files of publications and presentations) and the most relevant measurement data. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? On the shared networks drive (J-drive), Large volume storage (K-drive) and KU Leuven RDR. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The volume corresponding to dissemination data is expected to be relatively low (<100 GB), and therefore can be seamlessly embedded on the (K:) drive of KU Leuven. The costs (1000 EUR/year) will be covered by other on-going projects at that point in time. For research data, at current archiving costs of 10 Euro/(TB*year), we estimate a cost of 2000 Euro/year. These costs will be covered by funding acquired by the project PIs in the context of other research projects. 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in an Open Access repository Only researchers participating in the project will be able to access the data for the duration of the project. As soon as the article associated with the data is ready for publication, the data will be made open through the institutional repositories mentioned in 2.1. The data will be deposited in the institutional repositories: (KU Leuven: Research Data Repository (RDR) Research Data Repository (RDR) - RDR - Research Data Repository (kuleuven.be) . Data will be assigned with DOIs to create trustworthy and persistent links for online content. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 19 April 2024 8 of 10 If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. NA Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes, Intellectual Property Rights Before making data and other research output from the project (e.g. journal articles, book chapters and conference proceedings) openly available, they will be aligned with the project IP strategy to avoid premature disclosure, which can compromise the patent filing application(s). Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. KU Leuven RDR (Research Data Repository) When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. Data from the project that can be shared will be made available under a creative commons attribution license (cc-by 4.0), so that users have to give credit to the original data creators. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. Yes Data will be assigned with DOIs to create trustworthy and persistent links for online content. ORCID will be included in all publications and other dissemination material for all the researchers involved in the project. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? A restricted access repository can be implemented on a free tool, such as OneDrive, up to a certain volume. If this volume does not suffice, time-limited storage will be considered, thus limited to the time needed to download the data. The costs associated with data storage will be covered by the budget foreseen in the project agreement. 6.
