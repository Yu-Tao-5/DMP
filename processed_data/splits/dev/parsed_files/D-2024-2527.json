If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number). ☐ Yes (provide PRET G -number or EC S -number below) ☒ No Additional information: Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer , for example spin - offs, commercial exploita tion, … )? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate . ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes , please comment : The microfluidic platform that will be developed during the project might be patentable. In this case, all the designs and the results of the platform will be kept confidential until a patent application is completed. Patent submission will be evaluated in collaboration with KU Leuven research and development (LRD) department. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements , research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please explain: I am using some bacteria and algae that I bought from companies like SAG or DSMZ . They have material transfer agreements (MTAs) . These MTAs are not binding for publication of results as long as the company name is given as the source of the microorganisms. However, MTAs are forbidding the distribution of the microorganisms to other institutions and persons. The microfluidic platform does not need to be patented based on the microorganisms that are utilized in it. However, in case of doubt, we will check this both with the KU Leuven research and development (LRD) department and the companies that are prov iding the microorganisms. Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be assert ed. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 8 3. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures u sed, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata . Protocols, description of research results, literature studies, manuscripts will be kept a t as word and/or .pdf files on the KU drives. Protocols are kept on the website “eLab Journal ”. At first, t he data will be stored in based on the data type and work -packages. Later this data will be organized based on papers or patents arising fro m the project. All the codes and scripts will be kept in a similar manner. An example of subfolders foreseen is as follows: 1. Data –> Experimental data –> Microscopy images –> WP1 -> files 2. Data –> Codes –> MATLAB codes –> WP1 -> files 3. Data –> Codes –> COMSOL codes –> WP3 -> files 4. Data –> CAD designs –> Photomask designs –> WP1 -> files See the sec tion below for the naming conventions of the files. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COUL D ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: To aid interoperability community best practices and common terminology used in the field will be used where possible. No community -agreed metadata standards exist for this discipline. Therefore, data will be appropriately documented to allow for data validation and reuse (via README files that provides information on date that the data generated, methodology used, analysis methods, variable definitions, units of measurements). To manage the data, appropriate folder structures and file naming conventions as below will be used: - Date or date range of experiment: YYYYMMDD - Version number of file (v1 or V001) if generated on the same day - Descriptive file name (that is still reasonably short) - Initials of the person who last modified the file if data is generated and/or modified by several people. Otherwise this information wi ll be made available in the README.txt. - Avoid special characters (~!@#$%^&*). - Avoid spaces in file names. Use underscores (Input_File), dashes (Input -file) or camel case (InputFile). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data. ☒ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I -drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on -premis ☒ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☐ Other: How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? ☒ Standard back -up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back -ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No The total stored data is being checked by our lab manager and we di scuss if we need more data during the group meetings a few times a year. In case more data storage is needed, we request it from KU Leuven. If no, please specify : FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11 How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . Guidance on security for research data The network drive for the FWO -SB project folder and the large volume storage folder are secured by the ICTS service of KU Leuven with a mirror copy. Only other lab members, will have access to the shared folder. Unauthorized persons do not have access to this system. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be co vered? During the project, the data will be stored on OneDriv e. KU Leuven provides 2TB storage space for free on OneDrive. In case more data storage is needed, shared network drive and large volume data storage will be considered as options. In this situat ion, the costs will be covered by the project. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). Guidance on data preservation ☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be ke pt for 10 years (explain) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12 Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data . Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide . ☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Data will be stored at Large Volume Storage of KU Leuven. The total volume of expected data is around 1 TB. Data storage costs 104,42 Euro /TB/year. For storing data for 10 years, 1044,2 Euro will be needed. The costs will be charged to the project. KU Leuven allows buying blocks of 5 TB for this storage. However , Biomimetics group has already been using Large Volume Storage. The refore, the rest of the block 5 TB data storage space will be paid by other projects. 6.
