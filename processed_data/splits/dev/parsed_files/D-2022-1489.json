It will use\nthe autobiographies written by the sisters and analyze and classify the content of the visions that\nare described. It will subsequently relate them to the circumstances in which they manifested\nthemselves, and trace models in contemporary written and iconographic sources. It will further\nhistoricize by studying the visionsâ€™ roles in the lives of these women, in particular the\ngendered role in the confrontation between the nuns and their male superiors, as religious\nauthorities increasingly sought to control their spirituality by imposing on the seers the official,\nmale-authored discourse of the Church.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

The use and dissemination of archival and printed sources is\nfree whenever it serves scientific, non-commercial purposes. \n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\n1. Scanned images of paper-based archival data\nImages will receive a filename that refers to the archive, archive group, and the original\ndocument itself, using official abbreviations (e.g. ARA_ms_345_f302v = Brussels, Archives\ngénérales du Royaume, \nManuscrits divers\n, mss. 345, folio 302 verso). Images from the same\ndocument will also be assembled in one pdf that will thus become a digital version of the original\ndocument. As documents from public archives are usually described in public inventories, there\nwill be no need for further; the document number itself, as contained in the filename, will allow\nanyone to find these descriptions in these inventories.\nImages from private archives of which no inventories exist will be treated and assembled in the\nsame way, but a description of the document in a Word-file will be provided, containing all\nnecessary metadata.    \n2. Prosopography of the members of the religious communities under study\nInformation on the persons under study will be stored in an Excel-file with clear column and row\nheadings. In addition, an explanation of the headings in the document itself will be provided.\n3. Database containing the visions and their content and context \nInformation on the visions will be stored in an Filemaker-database with clear fieldnames. In\naddition, an explanation of the fieldnames will be provided in a separate Word-file. Once the\ndatabase is published on the internet, metadata will be included on ther webpage itself.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nYes\nAs the research data files will be created in MS Office, they automatically possess metadata\nincluding file name, author/creator, date, etc. (found under ‘Properties’ > ‘Details’). To allow for\neasier access and reuse, all data files will be inventorized in Zotero. Zotero provides a set of\nstandardized metadata for each document type.\nAfter the data will be published, the Dublin Core standard will be used to ensure optimal\ninteroperability of datasets (https://www.dublincore.org/).\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nData will be stored on the principal researcher's OneDrive account, provided by KU Leuven.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nOneDrive includes automatic back-up procedures. Docmuients are continually synchronized;\nolder versions of documents are continously available. \n \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nEvery researcher at KUL Leuven disposes of 2 TB of storage. \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nNone.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 5\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nThe data in this project are classified as 'low risk'. Sufficient security is included in the\nOneDrive licence. Access to the research data during the project will only be granted to the\nproject's collaborators (PI, copromotor, and junior researcher).\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll data will be retained by the principal investigator.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\n1. The data will be stored on the principal investigator's OneDrive account\n2. The data will also be stored on the faculty's server, where the principal investigator is already\nrenting storage capacity and is storing data from earlier projects. \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nStorage on OneDSrive up to 2 TB is free.\nStorage on the faculty's server up to 1 TB is 76 euro annually. \nThe database of visions will be hosted on the servers of KU Leuven. In view of the expected size\nof the database (> 2 TB), estimated cost will be 6000 euro to set up the database (drupal-design\nand drupal-infrastructure, MySQL setup costs, registration domain name, webhosting) and an\nannual fee of 500 euro for support. The design and publication of the database will be financed\nwith the remainder of the FWO-funds, support of the early modern history research group, and\nown funding. The annual fee is guarenteed by the 5000 euro budget the faculty yearly grants to\nevery member of the ZAP-staff that has no other financial means.

The dissertation and papers will be published by recognized scientific\npublishers and will be accessible via LIRIAS. The database will be available via the KU Leuven\nwebsite (e.g. the databases of the Early Modern History Research Group on\nhttps://www.arts.kuleuven.be/nieuwetijd/english/book-history#databases\n).

This will ensure the preservation and\navailability of these resources to those interested.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nSee Question 7.2.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nImmediately after the end of the project\nAfter an embargo period. Specify the length of the embargo and why this is necessary\nUpon publication of the research results\n1.
