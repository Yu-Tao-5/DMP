Data-driven machine learning (ML)\ntechniques have become ubiquitous in almost all fields of research as well as in everyday life, yet\nits potential remains underexploited in many fields of the Earth sciences. This project aims (i) to\nharness ML to better understand the connections between various land surface variables (in\nparticular soil moisture, vegetation, and snow) and their meteorological drivers (such as\nprecipitation, temperature, solar radiation, and wind), and (ii) to confront ML with modern LSMs\nand satellite-based land data assimilation to further our knowledge about biogeophysical\nprocesses, thus fostering the development of advanced physical theories and a ''digital twin\nearth''.\n1.

If only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is\nthe case (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nFinal generated data used in publications will be preserved.\nRe-used data will not necessarily be preserved, unless they remain used or are no longer\nsupplied by the original data providers.\n6.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)?\nVSC HPC (/archive).\n6.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How\nwill the costs be covered?\nThe final output of this project will be limited compared to all storage needed for the project,\nand is estimated at ±1000 euro for 5 years. The cost will be covered by future projects, and the\npromotor's basic working fund.\n7. Data sharing and re-use\n7.1.
