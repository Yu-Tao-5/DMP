Data-driven machine learning (ML)\ntechniques have become ubiquitous in almost all fields of research as well as in everyday life, yet\nits potential remains underexploited in many fields of the Earth sciences. This project aims (i) to\nharness ML to better understand the connections between various land surface variables (in\nparticular soil moisture, vegetation, and snow) and their meteorological drivers (such as\nprecipitation, temperature, solar radiation, and wind), and (ii) to confront ML with modern LSMs\nand satellite-based land data assimilation to further our knowledge about biogeophysical\nprocesses, thus fostering the development of advanced physical theories and a ''digital twin\nearth''.\n1.

Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)?\nVSC HPC (/archive).\n6.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How\nwill the costs be covered?\nThe final output of this project will be limited compared to all storage needed for the project,\nand is estimated at Â±1000 euro for 5 years. The cost will be covered by future projects, and the\npromotor's basic working fund.\n7. Data sharing and re-use\n7.1.
