Last modiﬁed 24 April 2023 6 of 9 NA Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? Describe these issues in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. No Will you process personal data? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. No Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes In the expectation we identify a viable biological control agent to manage Phytophthora cactorum in strawberry cultivation (and potentially other pathosystems), we will consider patenting the discoveries. Biological control technology is generating increasing interest from agrochemical producing companies in order to comply with the European policy aiming at reducing chemical usage for food production. Considering this, the project could be commercially valorized on later stages of the research. All the data set generated will be encompassed, as they are legally required for the commercialization of BCO formulation. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements/ research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. No Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. No 2. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). All protocols used in this project will be explicitly described according to the format we use at our lab. This format comprises the following information: purpose and application principle equipment and reagents quality control safety precaution procedure results recording data method limitation reporting results reference procedure references appendices Daily work will be monitored in an electronic lab notebook on OneNote, with the location of the data resulting from the experiment on the computer. Data will be sorted according to the work package of the project, and each folder will comprise: raw data (example: pictures) compiled data (example: excel file) trace of data analysis (using excel, R or GraphPad Prism) progress report with the \"story line\" around the data on powerpoint when needed for the comprehension, a .txt file with explanation of the data/protocol Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. No Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 24 April 2023 7 of 9 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? The data will be stored in three environment: locally on the computer (:C environment) for daily work on the KU Leuven network drive associated with the staff number (:I environment) on the cloud storage used at KU (One drive) Long-term storage is provided on the KULeuven network (K-)drive managed by the supervisor (Prof. H. Rediers) The KU Leuven network drives are automatically backed up every day For material data (DNA extracts, plants samples...) each box will be labelled and will contain an information sheet summarizing the experiment and the dates, in order to be able to link it with the lab notebook on OneNote. How will the data be backed up? Every month, the data stored on the local environment of the computer (:C environment) will be backed-up on the network environment of KUL (:I environment) and on OneDrive. Every 6 months, the data will be manually exported to a hard drive for the supervisor of the project to upload on KUL servers (:K environment) Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The local environment as well as the network and one drive environment are only accessible with personal credential. The physical storage of experiments results are only accessible for colleagues and other staff members. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The cost for storage are the following: external hard drive: covered by PME&BIM lab OneDrive subscription: covered by KU Leuven K-drive: covered by KU Leuven physical storage: covered by PME&BIM lab (-80°C freezer and -20°C freezer) 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). All the digital data will be saved for at least 10 years according to KU Leuven policy. Plant material will be stored the time needed for the samples to be processed, during the project timeframe (and will be discarded afterward). DNA extracts will be saved for the time of the project. All the strains being used are already stored in the PME&BIM microbial culture collection and will be stored here indefinitely. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Data will be stored on the KUL RDR (Research Data Repositories). What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Preservation of data will be free of charge, on the KUL servers. 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Other, please specify: The data will be shared on Open Access Repository if possible. For example, genome sequences will be shared on NCBI. In case some project results are patented, the data regarding the biological control agent will not be disclosed for the public until the patent is submitted. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 24 April 2023 8 of 9 In the case the project or part of the project results are submitted to patenting, the R&D team, supervisor and the PhD student working on the project will have access to the data. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes, Intellectual Property Rights If the project is patented, the genomic and chemical information of the strain will not be disclosed to the public. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. If there is no patenting: The genomic information will be available for public usage on NCBI Publication will be done in Open Access journal as much as possible, following KUL policy When will the data be made available? upon publication of research results Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. If no patent: Creative Commons Attribution Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. Yes Not available yet. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? None, the RDR is free of charge. Data sharing will also happen through publication in scientific and professional oriented journals, and the costs associated will be covered by the PME&BIM lab. 6.
