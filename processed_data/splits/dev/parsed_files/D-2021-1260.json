However, the \nhydrogenation of CO2 to CO (Reverse Water Gas\nShift Reaction, \nRWGSR) requires high temperatures due to the unfavourable \nequilibrium. Here we\naim at shifting this equilibrium by immediately \nconsuming the CO formed in a consecutive,\nhomogeneously \ncatalyzed reaction with an olefin, to form e.g. esters. This should \nallow to\nperform the reaction at moderate temperatures (150-200 C). \nThus the RWGSR and the olefin\nfunctionalization must be made \noperational and compatible in one pot. To realize this, the\nRWGSR \nfunction is installed in a narrow-pore zeolite host, to which the \nhomogeneous catalyst\nand the olefin have no access, but CO2 and \nH2 have. This shields the olefin from unwanted\nhydrogenation. Much \nattention is focused on the careful design of the zeolite RWGSR \ncatalyst,\nand to its characterization. The key proof-of-concept is to \nunite both reactions in one pot,\nopening up a range of CO2-to​chemicals reactions. The systemâ€™s kinetics are thoroughly\nanalyzed \nto understand the interplay of both reactions. Eventually, we will \nextrapolate the\nconcept to formation of polyketones and \nhydroformylation products, relevant to base or fine\nchemistry.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. General Information\nName applicant\nHendrik Van Dessel\nFWO Project Number & Title\n1S31822N - Olefin functionalisation with CO2 via in situ reduction through concerted action of\nhomogeneous and zeolite catalysts\nAffiliation\nKU Leuven\n2. Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nProcedures for performing reactions, for synthesizing catalysts and initial observations of these\nexperiments will be gathered. Such procedures will also result in raw data files containing\nchromatographic data (GC-FID, GC-MS, FTIR) and material characterization data (XRD,\nphysisorption and chemisorption data or spectroscopic analysis via UV-Vis, NMR etc.). These will\nbe processed in excel files, summaries and presentations, finally culminating in manuscripts\nand/or patents. The combined virtual volume of these datasets will be limited (< 10 GB), and will\nconsist mostly of data files containing GC chromatograms (up to 5 GB).\nExamples:\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 4\nType of data\nFormat\nVolume\nHow\ncreated\nX-ray\ndiffractaction\npatterns   \n.xrdml\n20 kB\nXRD\nspectroscopy\nof\nsynthesized\ncatalysts\nGC\nchromatograms\n.gcd\n< 2 MB\nGC analysis\nof worked-up\nreaction\nsamples\nNMR spectra\n/\n256 kB\nNMR\nspectroscopy\nof\nsynthesized\nproducts\nFTIR-data\ncalcmet.spectrum\n< 1 MB\nFTIR analysis\nof\nheadspace\n3.

Alternatively, some datasets contain metadata\nheaders on recording parameters (e.g. XRD diffractograms). The data will be stored and named\nin a consistent manner with unambiguous identifiers. Descriptions of experiments and materials\nare kept in physical lab notes for each identifier. The data will be processed and summarized in a\ncomprehensive excel worksheet with references to the identifiers. The resulting summaries will\nculminate in presentations, and finally in manuscripts and/or patents.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nPhysical hand-notes of procedures and initial observations are kept in lab books. Digital data,\nwith unambiguous identifiers for reactions and materials, are kept in cloud storage from ‘Box’.\nKU Leuven offers an Enterprise Box account 3, which offers an easy and secure storage space of\nup to 100 GB for each user.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nBy using the cloud storage of ‘Box’, digital data will be stored in parallel on the cloud and on the\npersonal computer of the applicant, guaranteeing back-up for this data. Most raw data is also\nstored and frequently backed up off-line on external hard drives.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThe cloud storage provides a storage space up to 100 Gb for each user, while the project is\nexpected to generate less than 10 GB.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nData storage costs on Box are included in an internal service contract with the KU Leuven IT\nsupport service (SET-IT). No additional costs are expected for the storage of data. In case\nadditional costs do arise, they will be covered by the project budget or reserve funds.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nThe data will be stored in the university's secure environment for private data. An Enterprise Box\naccount 3 for cloud storage ensures a secure environment.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nUpon termination of the contract, the data will be transferred and stored on an external hard\ndrive (Samsung Portable SSD T5 1 TB), managed by Annelies Van Vlasselaer.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nThe high capacity of the available external hard drive (1 TB) enables the preservation of data\nfrom multiple terminated or finished projects. Currently, an average of 15 GB is used for the\nfinished projects of each user, which allows to divide its cost over approximately 60 users. Given\nthe cost of the available hard drive of 120 EUR, the expected costs are negligible. The involved\nIT-expenses are included in the project’s consumable expenses or covered by reserve funds.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 4\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nNo\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nUpon publication of the research results, the full datasets will be made available upon reasonable\nrequest\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nUpon request by mail\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nOnly uses for research purposes will be allowed and commercial reuse will be excluded.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing?
