Sensitive data transfer will be performed according to the best\npractices for “Copying data to the secure environment” defined by KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault is maintained on\na monthly basis, including the application of upgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only\nICTS personnel (bound by the ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root rights.

If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Data storage is arranged at a departmental level and can be increased if needed. There is sufficient storage and back-up capacity on all KU Leuven servers: - The “L-drive” is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster with NetApp eseries storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front-end. - The “J-drive” is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controlers with an Ontap 9.1P9 operating system. - Onedrive provides 2TB of storage data which should be sufficient for (most of) the data generated in the project. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The “L-drive” and “J-drive” servers are accessible only by laboratory members, and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. Access to the digital vault is possible only through using a KU Leuven user-id and password, and user rights only grant access to the data in their own vault. Sensitive data transfer will be performed according to the best practices for “Copying data to the secure environment” defined by KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of upgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound by the ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. A security service monitors the technical installations continuously, even outside working hours. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? (The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 173,78€/TB/Year for the “L-drive” and 519EUR/TB/Year for the “J-drive”.) Created using DMPonline.be.

Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Digital data will be stored at the Archive (K:) server from KU Leuven ICTS. Physical samples will be stored in the freezers from the Research Group of Neurobiology. Proteomics data: will be deposited in public repositories. If appropriate, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of publication.

What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? We expect the costs to gradually increase up to 3000 euro/year. After the project, data preservation costs will be covered by the lab and other grants. 5. Data sharing and reuse 5.

In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in an Open Access repository The data will be made available after publication via the required link in the publications or upon request after an embargo period after publication (f.i. phenotype files, genetic data). The same holds true for unpublished data, they can be made available upon request but only after an embargo period (3 years; exceptionally 5 years after the project). If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. All team members have access as long as they are affiliated to KU Leuven. Once all files are released, anyone can use these data to generate new results, referring to the original publication and not for commercial use. Other data will be only released upon request and after an embargo period after publication. Data will be released under a CC-BY 4.0 reuse license.

What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs depend on the data repository selected and will be covered by the laboratory budget and project funding. 6. Responsibilities 6.
