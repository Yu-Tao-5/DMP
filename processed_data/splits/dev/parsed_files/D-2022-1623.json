It will be conducted by a team\nconsisting of a three doctoral researchers, who will work in close consultancy with the \nproject supervisors.\nProject Abstract:\nWhereas political, economic, military and demographic aspects of the decolonization of \nBelgian Congo have been studied thoroughly, our knowledge of the postcolonial fate of \nmissionaries remains limited to specific topics (e.g. the massacres of the 1960s) or \ngeneral narratives (e.g. inculturation and dialogue). This research project wants to \nexamine how the Church decolonized in the first decades of Congolese independence. \nThrough an interdisciplinary approach that triangulates historical, systematic-theological \nand qualitative social-empirical methods, it seeks to (1) examine the institutional, textual \nand oral histories of the RCC in post-independence Zaire/DRC, and (2) to use the results \nin order to describe, analyze and assess the concepts that orient local and global \ndiscourses of decolonization.\n2.

If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you\nwill use. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data\nProcessing for Research and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). Be\naware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal\nobligation.\nYes\nPrivacy Registry Reference: the PRET-application for the work package of the historical \ndoctoral research  has been submitted and approved by the ethics committee ( G-2022-5924-\nR2). In 2023, amendments to this application will be submitted for the other work \npackages of the project.  \nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used: sex / age/ ethnic\nbackground / religious affiliation\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the\nformal approval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nNo\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer\nand valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so,\nfor what data and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the\ndata you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in\nplace?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data\ncollected/generated in this project?\nFor the oral history conversations , details on the setting of the conversations, the \ninformed consent process, the subjects discussed and the instructions given to  \ninterviewers will be documented in a Word document. Also steps taken to remove\ndirect identifiers in the data will be described.\nFor the literature review studies, details on the literature search (choice of search\nterms, used library databanks) will be documented in a Word document.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be\nused. If no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nSince the disciplines of theology  and history do not have appropriate metadata standards,  \nwe will seek the advice of colleagues and research support staff at the University to \ndecide which metadata standard (if any) is appropriate for this project.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nFor the storage and preservation of data during and 10 years after the end of the\nresearch, a person responsible will be designated.\nDuring and for at least 5 years after the project, the researchers will store and share\ndata through:\n- A personal OneDrive account provided by KU Leuven (2 TB online storage)\n- The faculty's shared network drives\n- External hard disks that can be procured by the researchers\nBooks that will be bought with the project's funding will be stored and made available\nto other researchers through the Maurits Sabbe library. This will ensure the  preservation \nand availability of these resources to those interested.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe data will be stored on the personal OneDrive accounts provided by KU Leuven,\nwith automatic daily back-up procedures.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available\nthen explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nEach researcher of the project has a personal OneDrive account with 2 TB online\nstorage space.\nhttps://icts.kuleuven.be/sc/english/storage/onedrive\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project?\nHow will these costs be covered?\nData will be stored and backed-up with the personal One-Drive accounts of the project\nresearchers, provided by KU Leuven. There will be no additional costs for data storage\nand back up during the project.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not\naccessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nStorage of personal data from oral history conversations  will be password-secured. \nBitLocker will be turned on automatically on the PCs of the researchers. Researchers will \nactivate the multifactor authentication with the KU Leuven Authenticator app.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state\nthe reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation\nissues, ...).\nAll data sets described in section 2 will be retained for 10 years after the end of the\nproject on the researchers' OneDrive account provided by KU leuven.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up\nprocedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.\nAfter this period, recordings and transcripts of oral history conversations specifically can \nbe deposited in specialized archives, such as KADOC (KU Leuven) or the congregational  \narchives of the respective interviewee (for example Erfgoed Annuntiaten Heverlee or \nArchives des Soeurs de Sainte Marie de Namur). In this way, the data remains accessible, \nbut in the secured context of a mission/congregational archive: these institutions grant \naccess to archival material based on the individual researcherâs objectives and research \ntopics, often in dialogue with the creator of the data. Concretely, this means that every \ninterviewee will be asked if they agree with the preservation of their testimonies in such \nan institution, and if yes, whether or not they want to be involved in giving individual \npermission. \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of\n5 years? How will the costs be covered?\nData will be preserved on the researchers' OneBox for Business accounts that are\ncentrally financed up to 5 TB per user by KU Leuven. There will be no additional costs\nfor data storage.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data\n(e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nNo\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nMost data will be uploaded in a cvs format in Zenodo under a CC-BY license , except for \nall the data related to the oral history conversations and the digitized archival documents \nbecause of respectively ethical and legal constraints. The former category results from \nvery personal relationships of trust between researcher and participants. The current \nintensity of the decolonization debate and eventual tensions within catholic congregations  \nmake many of the topics discussed quite sensitive. The latter category is obtained by \nindividual permission from archival institutions, so making this data available Open \nAccess would be illegal. However, metadata documents on these data sets will be created \nan published Open Access, so that other researchers get a clear view on the totality of the \ndata created, and where and how to ask for access.  \nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn an Open Access repository .\nThe full dataset with documentation will be uploaded in a cvs format in Zenodo.\nhttps://zenodo.org/\nAs indicated above, in dialogue with participants, oral history data can be deposited in \narchival institutions, both in their digital depots (recordings as well as transcripts) and \nphysically (transcripts).\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nAll data not bound by ethical and legal considerations (see above)  will be uploaded in a \ncvs format in Zenodo as an open access dataset  under a CC-BY license. Therefore, it will \nbe available to anyone for any purpose,  provided that they give appropriate credit to the \ncreators. The oral history data will be accessible for individuals after a request procedure: \nthe archival institution storing the data will have to contact the member of the project that \ncreated the data, who will then either contact the participant or assess the request \nhim/herself when the participant has deceased. In this way, the participantâs rights, as \nestablished before the oral history conversations through the written consent form,  are \nprotected. \nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nno costs expected\n8.
