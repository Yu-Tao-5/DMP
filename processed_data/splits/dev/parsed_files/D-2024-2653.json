It is the most common\nneurological disorder affecting young adults. Despite many genome wide association and epidemiological studies the etiology of MS is still unknown.\n Recent insights have put Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and its host (the B cell) at the forefront of MS pathophysiology. However, the mechanisms linking\nthe virus to CNS inflammation remain elusive. Understanding this is essential to determine the next steps in management and novel therapeutic\ndevelopments in MS. Until now the state-of-the art has lacked a comprehensive view on the EBV-B cell-T cell axis and especially its link with clinical\ndisease progression. In this project, I will investigate the molecular mimicry hypothesis in the location of interest, the cerebrospinal fluid, and correlate\nthis reactivity with disease progression. I will combine state of the art single cell RNA-seq technologies with our in-house targeted sequencing\napproach to achieve maximal sensitivity for low abundant EBV transcripts, without losing information on general gene expression profile. Lastly I will\nexamine chromatin remodeling on a single cell level in CSF. At the end of the project, I am to obtain a fully characterized pre-clinical package on\nEBV- B cell - T cell interaction that can form the basis for future therapeutic strategies.\n​\n \nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n26-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
