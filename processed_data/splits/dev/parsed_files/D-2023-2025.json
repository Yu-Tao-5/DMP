The most\nexplored option is thermocatalytic cracking, but this solution requires high temperatures to\nachieve near complete conversion, especially when using noble metal-free catalysts. Plasma\ncracking of ammonia is not limited by the same thermodynamic equilibrium as the applied\nelectrical energy selectively heats electrons, due to their small mass, creating a thermal non-\nequilibrium. The highly energetic electrons can break up ammonia molecules and achieve\nhigher conversions at lower bulk temperatures. The main downside of plasma cracking is the\nrelatively high energy cost. During this PhD, a process, which combines the benefits of\nthermocatalytic and plasma cracking, will be explored. A packed bed reactor partly converts\nammonia to H2 and N2 (>50 %). The outlet of the catalytic reactor is sent to the plasma reactor,\nwhere the remaining ammonia is converted as much as possible (aiming at > 99%). The first\nobjective of this PhD is to develop a noble metal-free catalysts with high activity for ammonia\ncracking, without aiming at complete conversion (WP1). The second objective is to join the\ncatalytic and plasma reactor and find the optimal combination of process parameters\n(temperatures, flow rates, conversion efficiencies, energy requirements) to minimize total energy\ncost and maximize synergy production rate (WP2).\nLast modified: \n28-01-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
