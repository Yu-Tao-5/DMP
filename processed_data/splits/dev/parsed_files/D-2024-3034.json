Currently, no \neffective drug is available. Therefore, increased insight in how alcohol leads to liver injury is needed.\nAn important role has been proposed for intestinal bacteria in developing alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). \nDue to increased alcohol-induced gut damage, gut bacteria and their products leak into circulation and travel to \nthe liver where they induce inflammation and injury. In order to protect against invading pathogens, our body \nproduces antibodies (also called immunoglobulins) that exist in various types and forms that can recognize, bind \nand clear foreign material. Interestingly, ALD patients have increased antibody titers in their blood compared to \nhealthy individuals, indicating altered immune response towards specific substances. Yet, their contribution to \nALD remains unclear.\nWe hypothesize that increased antibody levels in circulation during ALD reflect altered immunity against gut-\nderived molecules that propagate liver injury. Hence, we aim to characterize antibodies, their targets and the \ncells that produce them (B cells) in blood and liver of ALD patients. Moreover, we will test their functional role \nduring ALD in appropriate mouse models. Taken together, these studies will result in novel insights in the disease \nmechanisms by which alcohol use results in liver disease and in the identification of novel targets for therapy.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data.☒ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☐ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☒ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☒ Other: K-drive (large raw data files) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? ☒ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back-ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data Researchers involved in the project can control who they give access to the files on their personal OneDrive. To access the KU Leuven servers, access is provided and controlled by the research manager, Hannelie Korf. The KU Leuven ICTS data center hosts the network storage, with a mirror available in the second ICTS center. This ensures additional back-up capacity, recovery of lost data and long term data availability. The access is controlled by KU Leuven security groups and it is password protected. Data related to Patients and controls are pseudonymized, which is managed by the research manager, Hannelie Korf. The list linking the anonymized code with patient records (name, EMDNR number, clinical data) is stored on the hepatology common J-drive, and is locked under password protection. Password access if provided for read-only access to the students and technicians who are working directly with the samples. Hannelie Korf retains the sole ability to modify this file under alternative password protection. All samples are processed and stored as per their anonymized code only. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Personal and Shared network drive (I, J) 503,66 euro/TB per year. All large primary data will be moved to LVS. LVS storage costs per 5 Tb (KU Leuven ICTS): 104,42euro/year. Expected amount of data (50TB). The costs have been budgeted on the grant. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 105. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): Digital data will be stored at the Archive (K:) server from KU Leuven ICTS. HCR probes and physical samples will be stored in the freezers from the laboratory of Hepatology. Code scripts will be stored on Github. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?We expect the costs to gradually increase up to 3000 euro/year. After the project, data preservation costs will be covered by other grants. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☐ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☒ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Since the data consists of genetic and health data, the data will only be shared under restrictions. The Informed consent form allows the sharing of pseudonymised data, however, the pseudonymisation key will not be shared. Sharing of data will only be possible after agreement of the DAC. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☒ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify: Since the data consists of genetic and health data, the data will only be shared under restrictions. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Other data repository (specify) ☒ Other (specify): Experimental data will be made available through a data repository such as EGA, ncbi, github, Genbank, FigShare (https://figshare.com/), Dryad ( https://datadryad.org/) or https://zenodo.org/depending on the type of data. We will explore the possibilities via online repositories and will use the website www.re3data.org When will the data be made available? ☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. Check the RDR guidance on licences for data and software sources code or consult the License selector tool to help you choose. ☐ CC-BY 4.0 (data) ☒ Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) ☐ MIT licence (code) ☐ GNU GPL-3.0 (code) ☐ Other (specify) Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☒ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☐ No FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? The transfer costs depend on the data repository selected. Costs will be covered by the project funding. 7.
