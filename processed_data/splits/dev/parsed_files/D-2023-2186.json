More specifically, it updates the generative notion of the\n\"Black Atlantic\" by foregrounding the underexposed role of legal realities and conceptions in transnational mobility\nthrough an innovative archival and text-analytical study of a corpus of twentieth-century African-American expatriate\nfiction. By examining how encounters with the law and interactions between legal and literary imaginaries shaped the\nliterary tradition that seeks to capture the concept of the Black Atlantic, the project has a threefold purpose: an analysis\nof an underexplored literary corpus from a methodological state-of-the-art perspective on \"righting\" and \"writing\";\nupdating the critical notion of the \"Black Atlantic\" based on these new analytical insights and a literary-critical\nperspective on literature and (human) rights; and mobilizing these analytical and conceptual innovations in a broad\ndialogue that updates the critical vocabulary for transnational experience for an era of mass forced displacement.\n \nLast modified: \n27-06-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

The external hard drive for backup will never leave my office. \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nNeeds to do not exceed the facilities provided by my university.

In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues,\ninstitutional policies...).\nAfter the end of the project, I will store my data on OneDrive for the ten \nyears according to the KU Leuven regulations.
