Specifically, we aim to\ndevelop algorithmical solutions that allow users of Virtual Environments (VEs) to explore the\nvirtual space by natural locomotion without resorting to 'supernatural' locomotion methods. We\npropose to enable natural locomotion through an architectural approach, to spatially transform a\nvirtual environment in response to the movement of the user to create spaces that are not only\nfunctional but pleasant to inhabit. We thus propose a novel class of redirection methods - 'overt'\narchitectural manipulations, by which we refer to dynamically changing architectural features in\nthe VE depending on user behaviour. Through iterative development, we will implement these\narchitectural transformations by developing a technological framework which will procedurally\ngenerate the appearance of a VE in real-time, depending on the behaviour of the VR user. We will\nevaluate our technological framework across a series of use-cases of increasing spatial\ncomplexity, from two contrasting modes of scientific inquiry: the experimental studies in\nComputer Science with the more phenomenological experience of space from Architectural\nDesign Science.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\nThere are no 3rd party agreements restricting dissemination or exploitation and all software\nlicenses of existing software are permissive.\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 6\nin this project?\n1\n. \nAll metadata, unless otherwise mentioned, will be stored in a secure One-Drive linked with a\nKU Leuven account (associated with the researchers involved in this project). \n2\n. \nVirtual Reality applications developed in this project will be documented and uploaded in\nthe lab GitLab account, which is KU Leuven-hosted (see https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/aria). The\nproject will be accompanied with a README .txt file for installation instructions (e.g., engine\nversion required, dependencies, how to run the executable file). \n3\n. \nMeasurement data will be stored in .csv files accompanied by metadata headers. Since\ncurrently there is not a formalised metadata standard of acknowledging metadata in the\ncontext of virtual reality locomotion, we will ensure all metadata are described consistently\nduring the project and are well documented.\n4\n. \nFor the interviews, details on the setting of the interviews, the informed consent process,\nand the subjects discussed will be documented in a .docx/.pdf.\n5\n. \nFor the sketchmaps, details on the setting of both the virtual and physical environment, the\ninformed consent process, and any subjects discussed will be documented in a Microsoft\nWord document. \nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nThere is no current standard for acknowledging metadata in the context of virtual reality\nlocomotion. See the previous question to read in detail how metadata will be created to make the\ndata easier to find and reuse. \n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\n1\n. \nElectronic raw data and final electronic data will be stored on the password-protected JDrive\nand/or on KU Leuvenâ€™s OneDrive. Any personal data will be pseudonymised at the earliest\npossible convenience (such as the deletion of interview audio files, which is considered a\ntype of identifiable personal data, after transcription into a word/.txt document).\n2\n. \nCollection of questionnaire data will be done as an online survey through the KU-Leuven\nhosted Limesurvey account, and exported into a KU Leuven OneDrive as a .csv file at the\nend of the experiment. \n3\n. \nPaper data (sketchmaps) will be archived in a locked closet in the office of the researcher at\nthe Department of Computer Science in KU Leuven. \n4\n. \nIf we collaborate with researchers from other research units within the EU, we will use a KU\nLeuven-associated OneDrive for active use of the data during the project. \n5\n. \nIf we collaborate with researchers outside of the EU: Data collected from user studies\nconducted within the EU will be stored within our KU Leuven-associated OneDrive. Other\ntypes of shared data will stored through one of the two methods: (1) Stored in our KU\nLeuven-associated OneDrive and shared via password-protected guest access to our\ncollaborators; (2) Stored in our collaborator's data-base, and saved into our KU Leuven-\nassociated OneDrive at the end of the experiment. Should any collaborations occur during\nthe project, this DMP will be updated accordingly to reflect more specific details. \nHow is backup of the data provided?\nAutomatic back-up is ensured by using KU Leuven's OneDrive.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nEvery KU Leuven employee/student has 2000GB (2TB) of storage space\n(https://admin.kuleuven.be/icts/english/services/onedrive). Given the nature of our data we do\nnot expect to exceed this storage capacity. In case we still do so, we will extend our capacity by\nrequesting network storage from the systems group at the Department of Computer Science. \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 6\nwill these costs be covered?\nAs stated above, we do not expect extra costs for data storage. In case we need to extend the\nstorage capacity, costs will be covered by the supervisorâ€™s credit and/or the project's resources.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nData will be pseudonymised and stored on encrypted KU Leuven drives. The identification files\nare being stored externally, which ensures that identification of participants by others than the\nsupervisor and the doctoral student is not possible. \nFor more details regarding the pseudonymisation process: Participants will be assigned an ID\nnumeric value which will be associated with the data types (questionnaire data, interview\nrecordings, sketches of maps). All identifying information will be deleted. No identifying\ninformation will be divulged or used in publications. The numeric ID will be entered when the\nparticipant fills in our questionnaires on limesurvey, and will be stored together with the\nquestionnaire answers on our server. Video and audio recording files will be renamed with a file\nname that includes this ID but no other identifying information. Sketchmaps will be scanned and\nshredded immediately afterwards. Voice recordings will be transcribed immediately after being\nrecorded then deleted. For participants who wish to stay informed on the outcome of the\nresearch, their e-mail address will be gathered in a separate questionnaire, not linked to their ID,\nat the end of the research. Email addresses will be deleted after the results have been sent out. \n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll collected data will be stored for at least 10 years, in order to enable reproducibility,\nverification, or reuse (https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/nl/rdm-beleid/basisprincipes-\nrdm/#principe4). Regarding  interviews, due to the sensitive nature of the data, raw audiofiles\nwill be deleted after publication of the article. Moreover, sketchmaps on paper will be scanned\nand then saved electronically. Once the sketches have been saved electronically, paper data will\nbe destroyed. \nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nCollected data will be stored for on KU Leuven's OneDrive for 10 years (with automatic back-up\nprocedures, conforming to the KU Leuven RDM policy), after which they will be deleted.\nOtherwise, the collected data will be re-evaluated whether it is still necessary to store them.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nStoring 1TB on the K-Drive costs approximately 200 Euro per year (https://ppw.kuleuven.be/ppw-\ndict/dictservicecatalog/access-to-shared-network-drives-and-printers-file-and-print). This storage\ncapacity will be shared with other lab members, leading to (estimated) 30 Euro for data\npreservation annually (i.e., 150 Euro for the 5- year retention period; 300 Euro for 10 years).\nCosts will be covered by the supervisorâ€™s credit and/or the project's resources.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nYes. Specify:\nAny data that has yet to be fully pseudonymised cannot be shared (e.g., raw audio files).\nRegarding the VR application (which is software removed from any personal data), we do not see\nany 3rd party agreements or legal restrictions that would prevent the sharing of our developed\napplication. If we, however, see potential exploitation of our developed software, we will consider\nthe use of a commerical license.\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nPseudonymised data will be shared upon motivated request. The VR application may be released\nunder permissive license, unless exploitation potential prohibits this. \nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n5 of 6\nIn an Open Access repository\n1\n. \nFor participants who wish to stay informed on the outcome of the research, their e-mail\naddress will be gathered in a separate questionnaire, not linked to their ID, at the end of the\nresearch. Email addresses will be deleted after the results have been sent out.  \n2\n. \nVR applications may be released via GitLab as open-source. \nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nData and software will be published and released as soon as we see fit and definitely upon\npublication of the research results. If particular software might have potential for valorisation, we\nmight consider a closed (commercial) license.\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nAccess will be considered after a request is submitted explaining the planned reuse. Only uses\nfor research purposes will be allowed and commercial reuse will be excluded. Researchers have\nto comply with the confidentiality rules for the given data. Pseudonymised data will only be made\navailable upon publication of all results on this part of the data. \nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nNone\n8. Responsibilities\nWho will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?\nThe PhD Student (Jihae Han) and the main supervisor (Adalberto L. Simeone) will be responsible. \nWho will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nThe PhD Student (Jihae Han) and the main supervisor (Adalberto L. Simeone) will be responsible. \nWho will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ?\nThe PhD Student (Jihae Han) and the main supervisor (Adalberto L.
