General Information\nName applicant\nKaren Bisschop\nFWO Project Number & Title\n12T5622N The role of the microbiome relative to the genome for niche width and host\nadaptation.\nAffiliation\nKU Leuven\nUniversiteit Gent\n2. Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 5\nOur overall aim is to elucidate the importance of the\nmicrobiome for the hostâ€™s niche width and host adaptation.\nThe questions are whether (i) we can find correlations\nbetween the microbiota and the host niche width using field\npopulations, (ii) we can detect an influence of the microbial\ncommunity on the adaptation of the host to novel host plants\nwith experimental evolution, and (iii) we can discover a\ndirect influence of the microbiota on the niche width of the\nhost using axenic strains and transplant experiments. This\nwill be achieved with the two-spotted spider mite,\nTetranychus urticae\n Koch (Arachnida: Acari), as a model\nspecies.\nThe research is divided in three complementary objectives: \nObjective 1:\n Gaining insight into the influence of the\nmicrobiome for host niche width. Using collected spider mite\npopulations across Flanders, we want to discover the main\ndriver for niche width of the different populations in \nWP1\n(16S, ITS and rbcL amplicon sequencing, completing\nperformance tests, whole-genome sequencing, scoring\nenvironmental variables).\nObjective 2:\n Investigating the importance of the\nmicrobiome for host adaptation (\nWP2\n). We will create iso-\nfemale lines with the same genetic background that are\neither having a poor microbiome (due to an antibiotic\ntreatment) or an enriched microbiome (via bacterial\ninoculation). The spider mite lines are selected based on\ntheir overall performance on the different host plant species.\nWe will select spider mite lines from WP1 that are either\nhaving a broad niche width (i.e. generalist) or a narrow niche\nwidth (i.e. specialist). These spider mite lines will be exposed\nto challenging host plant species and their performance\n(fecundity, longevity, leaf depletion, and growth rate) will be\nmeasured through time together with their microbiome (16S\nrRNA sequencing).\nObjective 3:\n Searching for the direct influence of the\nmicrobial community on host niche width. In \nWP3\n, we will\nperform transplant experiments of the microbial community\nbetween different spider mite iso-female lines. We plan to\ncreate axenic spider mite lines and inoculate them with their\nown microbiome or the microbiome of another spider mite\nstrain.\nType of data\nFormat\nVolume\nHow created\nScoring field\nobservations\nxlsx\n1 file,\nmax. 2 GB\nField survey of 32\nspider mite\npopulations (scoring\nof e.g. spatial traits)\nin WP1\nPhotographs\njpeg\n300-500\nGB\nDaily photographs of\nperformance tests of\nspider mites in WPs\n1, 2, and 3\nAmplicon\nsequencing\nfastq\n50 GB\n16S rRNA, RbcL, and\nITS amplicon\nsequencing in WP1\nand WP2\nWhole\nGenome\nSequencing\nfastq\n500 GB\nwhole genome\nsequencing Miseq\ndata from 32\npopulations in WP1\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 5\n3.
