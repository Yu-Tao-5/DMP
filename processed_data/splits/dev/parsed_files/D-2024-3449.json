Yes, human subject data WP 2.4 & WP 3.3 Both WPs involve the use of human cells (HEK293T, HUVEC), the aim is to evaluate the cytotoxicity and drug delivery efficacy of our synthesized nanoparticles. The raw data will be stored in .xls and visualised using GraphPad Prism. WP 2.4 will be performed through collaboration with Prof. Anna Sablina, the head of the Laboratory for Mechanisms of Cell Transformation (VIB-KU Leuven). WP 3.3 will be performed through collaboration with Prof. Rosario María Sánchez Martín, the group leader of NanoChemBio Lab at the University of Granada in Spain.

Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 15 December 2024 4 of 8 Liquid samples: Vials containing liquid solution are stored in the lab according to safety standards. Every sample will be labeled unambiguously (“name_time_conditions”) and will be recorded in a lab notebook. Subsequently, the sample name (combined with the corresponding conditions and observations) is added and saved into an electronic list (.docx, .xlsx), which also contains a more detailed description of the followed experimental procedure. Scanning electron microscopy: Pictures are captured according to SOPs and saved as .tiff files with the name “name_time_conditions”. The device settings are also automatically displayed in the saved pictures. Afterwards, samples cannot be stored. Photos: Relevant photos of the setup, samples, observations, etc. taken in the lab are saved in .jpeg, .png, or .tiff format. Plots and graphs: Data from experiments are provided as .txt files that can be plotted using GraphPad Prism software. Both the data for plotting and the output will be saved digitally. The output can be .tif or .png, depending on the final application of the plot/graph. Images: Images will be created using Paint.net and stored as .pdn files. The exported images will have the .eps, .png, .pdf, .tikz format depending on the final application. Notes: The physical lab notebook is used for setup design (sketches) and writing down observations. When not used in the lab, the notebook will be stored in a locked drawer in the office. Important notes (sample names, conditions, etc.: see above) are compiled into an electronic list (.docx or .xlsx). Manuscripts: Communication of scientific results is done via manuscripts and saved in .docx, .pdf, or .tex. Presentations: Presentations containing scientific results are produced using PowerPoint and stored accordingly (.ppt or .pdf).
