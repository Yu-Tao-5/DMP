Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nWP1: \nmass spec phophoproteomics data; excel; 100 MB; phosphoproteomics data obtained by mass\nspec analysis at the VIB proteomics service facility. \nGel images for validating strains; .tif; 30 MB; agarose gel electrophoresis images\nWP2:\nScanned Western blots: .tif; 30 MB; western blot images of phosphoproteins\nAll WPS: \ndata on novel strains that were generated. \n \n3. Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNo\nPrivacy Registry Reference:\nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used:\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 3\nYes\nIn work package 3 we will use primary macrophages that we isolate from the bonemarrow of\nmice. \nWe have already an approved ECD to prepare these primary macrophages from mice. \nWe will also use Galleria as a model system, but for this waxmoth there is no ethical document\nrequired.\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\n1. Microscopy images the following information will be noted: dimensions, image type, bit-depth,\npixel sizes and microscope settings. The methodology and protocol will be described in detail in\nthe lab book. A ReadMe file of the image collection will be written.\n2. phosphoproteomics data will be obtained and the information on the status of the cells at the\nmoment of harvesting will be documented in the lab book. Growth phase, temperature, strain,\ntreatment.\n3. All assays are available in the lab guide, which contains all protocols used in the lab. \nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nfor all experiments, detailed experimental conditions are noted down in the lab book. The most\nimportant parts of the methodology will also be mentioned in the manuscript.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nAll data are stored on the computer of the researcher. In addition, most data is stored on the I-\ndrive (personal) and all important data is stored on the K-drive  (shared) of the KU Leuven LUNA\nserver.\nAll data will end up on the KU Leuven storage. ICT biology can provide access to these project\nfolders\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic daily back-up\nprocedures.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nWe have included the costs in our project application. Expected costs are less than 10 euro (cost\nis 500 euro/TB/year). \nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 3\nThe data will be stored in the university's secure environment \n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll data that support the data presented in papers will be stored on the J drive (archive). In\naddition, all the large scale datasets (protein-wide phosphoproteomics data, sequencing data, ..)\nwill also be stored on this server.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures)\nfor at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nThe database of microscopy images, that will be compiled to realise this project, as well as the\nlarge set of phosphoproteomics data, will be hosted on the servers of KU Leuven. In view of the\nexpected size of the database (hundred GB), estimated cost will be below 50 euro to set up the\ndatabase and an annual fee of 50 euro for support.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nNo\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nThe full dataset will be deposited in a cvs format in KU Leuven RDR under a CC-BY license.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nOther (specify):\nData will be available on request after signing a data sharing agreement. The procedure for\nrequesting access to data will be provided by ICT Biology\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nThe full dataset will be uploaded on the archive server of KU Leuven\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nThe full dataset will be uploaded on the archive folder of KU Leuven.  Therefore, it will be\navailable to anyone for any purpose, provided that they give appropriate credit to the creators.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nThere are no costs for data sharing. \n8. Responsibilities\nWho will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?\nThe PI Patrick Van Dijck will be responsible. The contact person will be ICT Biology\nWho will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nICT Biology\nWho will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ?\nICT Biology\nWho bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nThe PI bears the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 3"
