One of the key actors in this change were the Jesuits. Their expansion resulted in the \ndissemination of new music across the globe, reaching China, the Philippines and Mexico. But despite \nsubstantive research on Jesuit music elsewhere, we know little about their musical legacy in the Low \nCountries. Understanding this facet of Jesuit music is nevertheless crucial, since their position in the \nUnited Provinces and Spanish Netherlands was unique. Unlike in the Spanish Empire, multiple factors in \nthe Low Countries tempered the Jesuits’ influence, particularly during the Eighty Years’ War. During this \nperiod of instability, the Jesuits endured persecution from both Dutch Calvinists and fellow Catholics such \nas the Jansenists: their institutions were closed, their activities limited, and many of their documents lost. \nDespite a lack of key sources, however, many Jesuit documents survive in private archives. My goal is to \nexamine these undiscovered sources, and to grasp how the Jesuits reformed Low Countries music in this \nunique era. I will create the first survey of Jesuit-printed music books in the Low Countries. Having \nexamined these neglected documents, I will offer the first full appraisal of the Jesuits’ role in the music \nindustry in the region. Such a project will offer a better and fairer picture of the Jesuits’ musical activities \nat large, both in Europe and globally.\n2.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

The primary storage location for the data will be the researcher’s personal laptop, which is backed up via iCloud, Dropbox, and Google Drive. The researcher also has two external hard drives, which as password protected. One is kept at home (Antwerp), and one in the researcher’s office (Leuven). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.Project data will be backed up to the KU Leuven OneDrive account. Data will also be backed up on the researcher’s personal external hard drives monthly. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: Data for this project takes up very little storage. If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7Only I (the researcher) have physical access to my personal laptop, which is also password protected. The external hard drives are password protected, and are kept in secure locations at home (Antwerp) and in the office (Leuven). The Dropbox and OneDrive accounts are also password-protected, the latter via KU Leuven Authenticator. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?No additional costs are required for data storage for this project. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).The ”Spreadsheet data” will be retained for at least five years after the research period. The “descriptive notes” will not, in their original form, be retained for five years after the research period. The “source images” will be retained for at least five years after the research period. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Relevant information from the ”Spreadsheet data” will, by the end of the research period, be made freely accessible long-term online the researcher’s own website. Although the “descriptive notes” and “source images” will not necessarily be retained for five years after the research period, the findings that they contain will be preserved long-term through publication as research articles, an edited book, and a monograph. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Costs for the storage and preservation of all data during the retention period will be covered by the researcher’s FWO bench fee. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 126. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☐ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.At “The 1520s Project” (online at https://1520s-project.org/about/ ) and at “IDEM” (online at https://www.idemdatabase.org/ ) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.Upon publication of research results, or by the end of the research period (whichever happens sooner). Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 “Spreadsheet data” will be made available under a Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY 4.0), where the data creator is myself (the researcher) “Source images” will be made available under a Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY 4.0), where the data creation is jointly credited to the Alamire Foundation and the University of Edinburgh. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes: 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Costs for sharing the “spreadsheet data” during the retention period will be covered by the researcher’s FWO bench fee. Costs sharing the “source images” data will be covered by the Alamire Foundation, as part of their Library of Music in Facsimile series and via their existing IDEM database. 7.
