All experimental data will be stored in an electronic lab book with the chronological reporting of all related experiments.

All data, experimental lab books and reports are stored\nelectronically on the personal KU Leuven One Drive for daily back-up and they are moved to the Large Volume Storage of the KU Leuven\nICTS on a monthly basis. Larger and RAW data files (SEM/TEM images) are directly stored on the Large Volume Storage of the KU Leuven\nICTS, designated for the OMFS-IMPATH research group.\n2.

The reserach groups provides sufficient data storage for all larger data files in the Large Volume\nStorage of the KU Leuven ICTS. Since the data are stored on KU Leuven servers, and these drives are expandable in blocks, the backup\ncapacity is technically not an issue.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nData stored in the KU Leuven One Drive is not accessible by any other person except the researcher. All data will be stored in the university's\nsecure environment for private data in a certified and GDPR compliant cloud platform.. Data files in the Large Volume Storage of the KU\nLeuven ICTS are only accessible by lab members via a two-step authentication system.

After 10 years the researchers will decide whether it is necessary to store the data for\na longer time. If it is necessary to keep the data, a reminder date will be set at which the researchers will again decide whether the data still\nneed to be kept.

Thus, for 5 years, it would be €2845.\nHowever, since the expected data for this project is 1TB, we anticipate being able to share these costs with other lab projects that also need to\nbe stored for the long term.

No There are no standards for metadata for most of the experiments carried out in this project. For this reason, all relevant experimental information for reproducibility will be collected and stored with the data: cell lines, culture conditions, instrument settings, experimental conditions (time points, control groups) and analysis software information will be included. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? 1. All experimental data will be stored in an electronic lab book with the chronological reporting of all related experiments. Results will be reported in electronic books that include a cross reference to the electronic lab book. All data, experimental lab books and reports are stored electronically on the personal KU Leuven One Drive for daily back-up and they are moved to the Large Volume Storage of the KU Leuven ICTS on a monthly basis. Larger and RAW data files (SEM/TEM images) are directly stored on the Large Volume Storage of the KU Leuven ICTS, designated for the OMFS-IMPATH research group. 2. The physical data will be stored in a closed storage cabinet in a locked office at the University Hospital Leuven, St. Raphael, 3000 Leuven. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Daily back-up of newly generated data is guaranteed with the KU Leuven One Drive service, while for the Large Volume Storage the general ICT backup Policy is applied. For non-digital data, digital copies of the files will be made on a monthly basis and stored in the L-Drive. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes The OneDrive has a limitation in storage capacity (2TB) which will be sufficient for the electronic lab notebooks, small datasets and experiment reports generated in this project. The reserach groups provides sufficient data storage for all larger data files in the Large Volume Storage of the KU Leuven ICTS. Since the data are stored on KU Leuven servers, and these drives are expandable in blocks, the backup capacity is technically not an issue. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Data stored in the KU Leuven One Drive is not accessible by any other person except the researcher. All data will be stored in the university's secure environment for private data in a certified and GDPR compliant cloud platform.. Data files in the Large Volume Storage of the KU Leuven ICTS are only accessible by lab members via a two-step authentication system. When making the decision to dispose of the research data and materials, the data manager will consider professional standards, legal requirements, and contractual arrangements. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The KU Leuven OneDrive comes without charge, and will be enough for storing data/lab notebooks and reports for the entire duration of the project. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 08 February 2024 5 of 9 The cost of the storage of 5TB of data for 1 year on KU Leuven L-Drive server is €569.2, which corresponds to the minimum possible to pay. The total amount will then be €2277 during the 4 years of the project. The cost will be covered by existing lab grants. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project?

In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). institutional policies...). All protocols created during the project will be kept for 20 years. This is due to the fact that they are SOPs, that will be used for future research as well. The data generated will be kept for at least 20 years as well, seen the potential for patenting the outcomes. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Data relevant to the research will be securely stored for 10 years at the dedicated and protected OMFS-IMPATH server location of the Biomedical Sciences group of the KU Leuven (L-Drive). After 10 years the researchers will decide whether it is necessary to store the data for a longer time. If it is necessary to keep the data, a reminder date will be set at which the researchers will again decide whether the data still need to be kept. When further storage is no longer necessary the data will be deleted. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The cost of the storage of 5TB of data for 1 year on KU Leuven L-Drive server is €569.2, which corresponds to the minimum possible to pay. Thus, for 5 years, it would be €2845. However, since the expected data for this project is 1TB, we anticipate being able to share these costs with other lab projects that also need to be stored for the long term. These costs will be met by existing lab grants. 5. Data sharing and reuse 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?
