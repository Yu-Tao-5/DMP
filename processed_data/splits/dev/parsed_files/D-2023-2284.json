Dehydrogenation is endothermic and at\nhigh temperature (> 500°C) faces selectivity challenges. Here we will dehydrogenate alkanes at moderate temperature\n(100-200 °C), by driving the reaction with (renewable) electricity in a two-compartment electrochemical reactor. At the\nanode, we use either a noble metal catalyst that is promoted to enhance its selectivity for monodehydrogenation;\nor a homogeneous pincer Ir catalyst is used, which\nafter alkane dehydrogenation and metal dihydride formation is\nregenerated at the anode. Ir pincers allow unique, e.g. terminal\nselectivity. At the cathode, the protons and electrons from the alkane are used to reduce CO2 to formic acid on modified\nSn electrodes, which need to operate at the same temperatures as the anodic compartment. Critical is the membrane\nbetween anodic and cathodic compartments which must conduct protons even at 100-200°C; mixed matrix membranes\nwith stable polymers (e.g. polybenzimidazole) and metal-organic framework fillers will be designed and applied. All\ncompounds are assembled in a masstransport optimized electroreactor. Advanced operando techniques (in situ TEM,\nXRD, DEMS) are applied to characterize the catalyst in the actual reaction conditions, and to measure rates of\ndehydrogenation, proton transport and CO2 reduction.\nLast modified: \n29-06-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
