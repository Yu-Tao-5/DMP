        "full_text": "PhD Fellowship\nA Data Management Plan created using DMPonline.be\nCreators: \nCatarina Fernandes, Irene Taurino\nAffiliation: \nKU Leuven (KUL)\nFunder: \nFonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)\nTemplate: \nFWO DMP (Flemish Standard DMP)\nPrincipal Investigator:\n \nCatarina Fernandes\nProject Administrator:\n \nIrene Taurino\nGrant number / URL: \n1S58823N\nID: \n191091\nStart date: \n01-11-2022\nEnd date: \n31-10-2024\nProject abstract:\nMonitoring tissue oxygenation provides vital clues on the status of numerous injuries and\ndiseases. For instance, a state of insufficient oxygen supply (hypoxia), often suggests the\nimmunological rejection of a freshly transplanted organ, the occurrence of ischemic events, or\nmalignant tumor progression. Research shows that hypoxic tumors offer a stronger resistance to\ntherapy, as well as increased metastatic spread. Thus, continuous monitoring of tumor\noxygenation levels, prior to and during the course of treatment, is key in cancer therapy\nmanagement. Unfortunately, the current golden standard for tumor hypoxia monitoring, the\nneedle electrode method, is an invasive, repetitive, and non-continuous procedure. Thus, there\nis an urgent need for alternative oxygen sensing tools. We propose SenOx: a miniaturized,\nimplantable, electrochemical oxygen sensor. Uniquely, SenOx will be built entirely from\nbioresorbable materials. A transient design will eliminate the need for secondary surgeries and\nelectronic waste, whilst largely reducing inflammatory risks. Improving over the needle electrode\nmethod, SenOx will allow continuous in-situ oxygen monitoring with an envisioned operational\nlifetime of three weeks before undergoing full dissolution in the body. By bringing SenOx to a\ncompletion, we will be achieving a one-of-a-kind diagnostic tool, aligned with current technology\nand with a much-needed modern twist.\nLast modified: \n19-01-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nYes\nThe work certainly has a potential for commercial valorization. RAW data, as well as detailed protocols and methods, will not be shared\nor disseminated beyond the research team. Treated data (shown in academic .ppt presentations or conference abstracts) will be prior\nran through the LRD office for their assessment and input.\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer\nagreements/ research collaboration agreements)?

If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.\nNo\n2. Documentation and Metadata\nClearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data\nunderstandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types\nrequired, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is\nrecorded).\nAll protocols and methodology are kept in readme.txt and .pdf files, shared with the research supervisory team. Data collected directly\nfrom certain equipment (e.g. four-point-probe meter) with no possible digital data format(s), are kept in a physical and electronic\nlaboratory notebook (Evernote).\nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per\ndataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type)\nwhich metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.\nNo\n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 19 January 2023\n4 of 7\nDuring the entire duration of the research, data files will be kept in the PhD student's (Catarina Fernandes) work laptop, automatically\nsynced to her KU Leuven OneDrive account for continuous cloud storage, and shared with the supervisory team. \nHow will the data be backed up?\nAdditional backups will be archived in the protected ESAT cloud. Long-term data preservation (after research) will occur in Zenodo.\nEvery 6 months, all data is backed-up into a physical pen-drive.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nGiven the rather small size of each individual file, we believe that we currently possess sufficient storage space. However, if this reveals\nto be untrue, standard data storage in the central KU Leuven data-centers offers a storage capacity of volumes between 100 GB and\nseveral TB.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nRaw and treated data are stored in the PhD student's personal work computer and One Drive account, both which are password\nprotected. Backups will be archived in the protected ESAT cloud. A physical pen-drive containing all current back-ups, is permanently\nstored in the personal residence of the PhD student. \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nStandard data storage in the central KU Leuven data-centers, for small volumes up to 500 GB, per 100 GB disk, can cost up to 251\neuros (Price per TB per year). The cost can be supported by the yearly bench fee provided via the FWO grant. \n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after\nthe end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual\nrestrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\nData (raw and treated) can and may be preserved for 10 years, according to the KU Leuven RDM policy. The data will be archived long-\nterm in Zenodo. Items will be retained for the lifetime of the repository. This is currently the lifetime of the host laboratory CERN, which\ncurrently has an experimental programme defined for the next 20 years at least.\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nThe data will be archived long-term in Zenodo. \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nIn Zenodo, content may be uploaded free of charge by those without ready access to an organised data centre.\n5. Data sharing and reuse\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 19 January 2023\n5 of 7\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  In the comment section please explain\nper dataset or data type which data will be made available.\nYes, in an Open Access repository\nYes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …)\nAs the project reaches a conclusion, the PhD student, supervisory team and KU LRD, must in face of the potential and intent of\ncommercialization of the research results, assess what is the best strategy for long-term data storage (possibly partly with open access\nand restricted access). \nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.\nThe research team, and/or partners and collaborators under request. \nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd\nparty, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nNo\nNot momentarily. \nWhere will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.\nCurrently, all data is stored in a shared One Drive folder (with the supervisory team). In the future, we will consider larger storage\nplatforms, such as Zenodo. \nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon acceptance of a scientific publication or at the end of the PhD project.\nWhich data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why.\nTo be discussed with the KU LRD. \nDo you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in\nthe comment section.\nYes\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing?
