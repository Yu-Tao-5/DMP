The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Jef Brebels - http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0920-8305\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Arn Mignon - http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4339-8827  - Supervisor\nVeerle Bloemen - http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0332-2833  - Co-supervisor\nProject number 1 & title Development of a double-layered polymer-based tubular construct loaded with enzyme-responsive \npolymersomes for flexor tendon repair\nFunder(s) GrantID 21SH1D24N\nAffiliation(s) KU Leuven \nROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\nPlease provide a short project description Flexor tendon injuries are a significant problem for patients, healthcare, and society as a whole, due to  \nextended healing times and various postoperative complications such as infections, adhesions, and scar  \ntissue formation. The expression of collagen type III is largely responsible for the latter, diminishing the  \nultimate strength of the hand. These complications often necessitate re-operation or, in some cases,  \namputation. Flexor tendons lack the capacity for spontaneous healing, requiring traditional techniques such  \nas suturing or grafting, which fail to provide an adequate long-term solution. In the last decade, researchers  \nhave attempted to produce constructs to address these recurrent issues, incorporating active compounds.  \nHowever, this often results in a burst release and inadequate mechanical strength and thus not providing a  \ncombined solution for both the mechanical and biological problems. The proposal is designed to develop a  \nsmart polymer-based  double-layer fibrous construct that provides an enhanced healing environment for  \ninjured  flexor  tendons.  Additionally,  by  aligning  the  fibres  parallel  to  the  collagen  fibrils  by  melt  \nelectrowriting, the aim is to reduce tendon scar tissue. The outer layer will be processed by electrospinning.  \nSpraying of enzyme-responsive polymersomes in between the layers will ensure a controlled release of  \nantimicrobial compounds. The proposal surpasses the current state-of-the-art in the biomedical field of  \nflexor tendon repair.\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number. This question is optional. Applicants can only provide one project number.  2 Funder(s) GrantID refers to the number of the DMP at the funder(s), here one can specify multiple GrantIDs if multiple funding sources were used.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 32.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project. For each dataset or data type \n(observational, experimental etc.), provide a short name & description (sufficient for yourself to know what data it is about), indicate whether the data are \nnewly generated/collected or reused, digital or physical, also indicate the type of the data (the kind of content), its technical format (file extension), and an \nestimate of the upper limit of the volume of the data 3. \nThe project will generate qualitative and quantitative experimental data from material syntheses and their corresponding physico-chemical, mechanical and  \nbiological analyses. The spectra and other produced files will be stored on a computer with regular back-ups to an online cloud. A second type of data that will be  \ngenerated during the project will be numerical (quantitative read-outs and derived parameters) and multimedia files (images from live cell imaging, confocal  \nmicroscopy). These data will be collected or exported in data objects such as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx) and image files such as .png, .tiff, .jpg and their  \nrespective raw image data which can be opened and analyzed with ImageJ, an open-source software. Due to the usage of different experimental set ups, the  \nexpected total volume will be up to one TB. A third relevant dataset will include all the research protocols, SOPs, PowerPoint presentations and publications  \nwhich will be stored primarily as excel, word, PowerPoint and PDF files. The total volume is estimated to amount up to 50 GB. No personal data will be collected,  \nnor will this data be used. All the data will be stored on the personal network drive of the involved researchers with automated regular backups on the OneDrive  \ncloud and physical hard-drives.

Big data such as extensive multimedia files will be stored on the personal network drive from KU Leuven. If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data OneDrive encrypts the files with a unique AES256 key encrypted with a set of master keys stored in Azure Key Vault of Microsoft. OneDrive gives at-rest and in-transit encryption as standard for all users and file types. For the physical hard drive backups, these will be kept at the research location and will only be accessible by the researchers involved in the project. The institutional accounts and equipment are also protected from logging in by username and password complemented by an internal authentication developed by the university. KU Leuven drives are restricted to personnel of KU Leuven. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 8What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Two TB of storage on the institutional OneDrive is provided to every researcher for free by the university. The hard drives for data transfer can be bought on the project budget in case of need. The back-ups will be kept at the corresponding drive of KU Leuven network. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 95. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) The research project involves the synthesis and improvement of procedures and protocols which are needed for the continuation of the research and will be stored indefinitely. These implementations result in Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). This project may also re-use or continue from SOPs that have been logged in from former projects into dedicated platforms for data management (i.e., Microsoft Teams). Raw data of the project will also be stored on the personal network drive from KU Leuven. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): Data of long-term value will be published in the form of research articles in journals with Open Access possibility; for which intermediate data and workflows used for the manuscript will be published alongside with the original data if suitable for the scientific community. The rest of the data will be kept stored on the personal drive of KU Leuven linked to the project and relevant data for future experiments will be kept on the OneDrive platform. Physical and automatic online back-ups performed regularly and will also be kept on the archive network drive from KU Leuven. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?For storage on external hard drives, the cost is limited to the purchase of these. The storage on the university OneDrive platform and the university drives have no direct additional costs allocated to the research group. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☐ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☒ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Institutional access only Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☒ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify: Yes, before sharing, the potential of IP will be assessed. If there is, its relevance will be communicated to the technology transfer department, after which all relevant data will be restricted until the filing of a patent. In the meantime, the data will be kept at KU Leuven’s Research Data Repository. Once the patent is granted, the data will be published in articles with open access. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Other data repository (specify) ☒ Other (specify) Data assessed as relevant for future research will be made available to researchers at the corresponding institute. In a restricted access repository Upon request by mail Other (specify): at KU Leuven’s shared drive with possible restrictions due to IP possibilities When will the data be made available? ☐ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☒ Other (specify) After an embargo period. Upon publication of the research results Should there be IP-related issues, an embargo will be established up to the publication of the IP Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED.
