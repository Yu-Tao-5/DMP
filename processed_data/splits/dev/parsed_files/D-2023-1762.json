Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nPatient data will be entered by way of an eCRF in CASTOR EDC (a central GCP proof internet-based database) to facilitate on-site data-entry. The stored data will be directly encrypted with an\nidentification code (CASTOR will generate a coded ID per case) on a secured network disk, thus information identifying the patient or child will be omitted. After completion of the study the coded\ndata together with the trials management file will be stored in the secured DataSafe at the LUMC, Leiden. \nHow will the data be backed up?\nCASTOR EDC backups are made four times a day and stored at another geographical location by Castor. The backup files are kept for fifteen days. Reserve copies can be restored but this might\nadd additional costs.\nEvery day a copy is made of any changed files in DataSafe. A full back-up of data is made once per week.  Also, monthly and quarterly backups are made so that earlier data can also be restored\nif necessary. \n \n \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nBoth Castor EDC and DataSafe have sufficient storage and backup capacity for the estimated 10-100 GB of digital data that our project will generate.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nPatient data will be entered directly by way of an eCRF in a central GCP proof internet-based database to facilitate on-site data-entry. The collected data will be directly coded when stored.\nCASTOR will generate a coded ID per case. In that way, the data cannot directly be traced back to the patients and personally identifiable data will not be handed over to investigators that do not\nhave a therapeutic alliance with the patient. Personal data are only processed by the researchers or by those who fall directly under their authority. Security is guaranteed with login names, login\ncodes and encrypted data transfer. \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nUse of CASTOR with large file uploading is 1800 Euro/year (excl VAT) – for duration of study. The costs will be divided by the participating sites. Datasafe is provided at no extra cost by the\nLUMC, Leiden.\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 31 March 2023\n6 of 8\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be\npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\nAt the end of the study, we will extract the raw data from CASTOR EDC and save these and the processed data for long-term archiving in DataSafe. In line with the Netherlands Code of Conduct\nfor Research Integrity, raw and processed data will be stored for a period of at least 20 years. For this, the LUMC has long-term storage with back-up available.\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nThe data will saved in DataSafe provided by the LUMC, Leiden.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period?

Patient data will be entered directly by way of an eCRF in a central GCP proof internet-based database to facilitate on-site data-entry. The collected data will be directly coded when stored. CASTOR will generate a coded ID per case. In that way, the data cannot directly be traced back to the patients and personally identifiable data will not be handed over to investigators that do not have a therapeutic alliance with the patient. Personal data are only processed by the researchers or by those who fall directly under their authority. Security is guaranteed with login names, login codes and encrypted data transfer. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Use of CASTOR with large file uploading is 1800 Euro/year (excl VAT) – for duration of study. The costs will be divided by the participating sites. Datasafe is provided at no extra cost by the LUMC, Leiden. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 31 March 2023 6 of 8 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). At the end of the study, we will extract the raw data from CASTOR EDC and save these and the processed data for long-term archiving in DataSafe. In line with the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, raw and processed data will be stored for a period of at least 20 years. For this, the LUMC has long-term storage with back-up available. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? The data will saved in DataSafe provided by the LUMC, Leiden. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Storage in DataSafe is provided by the LUMC for the purpose of the study. 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. We have privacy-sensitive data, and therefore, we will not share this data in Open Access. Data will be shared in agreement with GDPR, legislation and agreements in place. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes, Privacy aspects The collected data are personal and privacy-sensitive. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. After completion of the study, the data will be archived at LUMC in the DataSafe database. When will the data be made available? The data can be made available after publication of the research results. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. The data can be used for future research in agreement with GDPR, legislation and institutional agreements in place. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. No We will, if possible, publish the metadata online with a persistent identifier. If the image data are released in tissue-IDR, then a data DOI will be minted following public release. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? We will not use on Open Access repository. The data will be stored in DataSafe, which is provided by the LUMC. 6. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project? The principal investigators and their assigned collaborators of the participating sites Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 31 March 2023 7 of 8 Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project? The principal investigators and their assigned collaborators of the participating sites through CASTOR EDC Who will manage data preservation and sharing? currently part of the contract negotiations if all sites will be joint-data controllers or LUMC will act as data processor and the other sites will be controllers. Who will update and implement this DMP? Liesbeth Lewi principal investigator at UZ Leuven Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 31 March 2023 8 of 8"
