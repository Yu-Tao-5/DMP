The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal.

Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan.

Through advances in genome sequencing we now know what the \nvariants are that differ among individuals. However, with current methods it is difficult to pinpoint which of \nthese variants contribute to a trait. Variants can also interact to mask or enhance  each other’s effect, further \ncomplicating their functional interpretation. Little is known about how such genetic interactions contribute to \ntraits as on top of not knowing which variants cause a trait no methods exist to systematically study their \ninteractions. We believe knowledge of principles how  variants interact is key as it may explain why people with \nthe same disease variant show varying disease severity or why beneficial variants are less beneficial in a new \ncontext in bioengineering. We have recently developed a CRISPR-based tool that can engineer and measure the \nimpact of 1000s of variants in parallel in the model S.cerevisiae. We will first use it here to systematically find \nsequence variants that contribute to diverse traits. We will then extend our tool to allow efficient engineering of \npairs of these variants and study for the first time how their genetic interactions shape traits.
