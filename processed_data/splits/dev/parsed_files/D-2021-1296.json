Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNo\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 5\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)?

If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nIn general, in-house collected data will be noted in the lab book unless otherwise described in\nthat lab book. Data collected not in-house or digital data will be assigned to a specific folder in\nthe FWO fellow's (Thibault Vantieghem) KU Leuven Onedrive. For example: PhD\nBiocrystallography > WP2 > MST > Date of data > Specific data.  One exemption here is all data\ncollected at synchrotrons. These data sets will be stored at the NAS of the Laboratory for\nBiocrystallography and will be easily to find since there is a standard known by everyone working\nin the Laboratory for Biocrystallography.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nA metadata standard will not be used. However, all data will be easy to find since an excel sheet\nwill be present in which all dates of experiments are mentioned with a short description. In this\nway it should be easy to find all data since they are nicely divided into different WPs and\nsubfolders. For example: for each session at a synchrotron, soaked crystals and corresponding\ncollected data sets will be mentioned in an excel file (i.e. 2022.03.20_SLS_PXI.xlsx) with a\ndescription of the most important notes (protein, compounds, soaking time, diffraction resolution\netc.). In this way it will be easy to find that specific dataset on the NAS of the Laboratory for\nBiocrystallography (XXX > XXX > 20220320_SLS PXI > PIN 3 > dataset 1).\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nData will be stored at the FWO fellow's (Thibault Vantieghem) lab PC, personal external hard\ndrive and lthe NAS of the Laboratory for Biocrystallography. The data on the fellow's lab PC is\nautomatically synchronized onto the fellow's KU Leuven Onedrive. A shared OneDrive folder is\nused to share data with collaborators.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe data on the fellow's lab PC is also automatically synchronized with the fellow's KU Leuven\nOnedrive. Data from the FWO fellows (Thibault Vantieghem) KU Leuven Onedrive will also be\nbacked up every 3 months onto a personal external hard drive. Data on the NAS of the\nLaboratory for Biocrystallography is backup up on itself since it is a Synology hybrid RAID system.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 5\nThe KU Leuven Onedrive provides 2 TB of storage. The network-attached storage (NAS) of the\nLaboratory for Biocrystallography has currently 50 TB\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nThe expected costs for data storage during the project will be around 1000 euro. Costs will be\npartially covered both by the research budget provided alongside with the FWO fellowship of\nThibault Vantieghem and the Laboratory for Biocrystallography.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nAccording to the FWO fellow's (Thibault Vantieghem) lab PC: an antiviral system is installed, no\nconnection will be made with unknown networks and no illegal programs/software will be\ndownloaded.\nAccording to the personal external hard drive: this will be kept safely at the fellow's home.\nAccording to the NAS of the Laboratory for Biocrystallography: access is only provided for strictly\nassigned persons and protected by a password.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll obtained data will be archived for at least 5 years.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nAll obtained data will be archived at the Laboratory for Biocrystallography at KU Leuven.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nThe expected costs for data preservation during those 5 years will be around 500 euro. Costs will\nbe covered by the Laboratory for Biocrystallography.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nYes. Specify:\nBefore patenting, the structures of the compounds will only be shared between close\ncollaborators when necessary.\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nOnly data which were already published/mentioned in papers will be made available after the end\nof the project for public use. However, for a possible continuation of this research project, all\nunpublished data will be available in the Laboratory for Biocrystallography. In this way, data can\nstill be accessed on demand.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nUpon request by mail\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nEveryone will be able to request access to published data by mail. Nevertheless, the PI (Sergei\nStrelkov) and FWO fellow (Thibault Vantieghem) will, under consultation, evaluate if the request\nwill be accepted. For example, on going collaborations/collaborators will, by great change, be\naccepted while competitive labs will be denied.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing?
