Even the well -established Belgian healthcare system \nwas challenged, where 17% of the hospitals faced a ventilator surge capacity problem  during the first \nCOVID -19 wave. The shortage of ventilators forced physicians to decide which patients would get a \nventilator and thus a survival chance. Since the number of available ventilators was a serious bottleneck, \na worldwide race started to solve  the ventilator surge capacity problem. (REF) The known concept of \nsplitted ventilation or shared ventilation, where two patients share the same ventilator via a splitted \nventilation circuit, was proposed as one of the possible solutions. The set -up is sim ple: by splitting a \nventilator circuit with a y -piece, two patients can be ventilated using only one ventilator. The term shared \nventilation is preferred over splitted ventilation, since unlike the simplicity of the set -up, the procedure of \nshared ventilat ion is challenging. (REF) Simply connecting patients in parallel to a ventilator without \nconsidering their individual ventilation requirements has potentially disastrous consequences, as it can \ncause ventilator induced lung injury (VILI).(REF) Therefore, p atients need to be paired according to their \nventilation requirements when ventilator sharing is initiated. However, it is difficult to find within one \nhospital two suited patients with an equal body constitution and lung pathology severity. Moreover, it i s \nhighly unlikely that the initially well -matched patients will remain so throughout the course of their disease. \nTo tackle the problem of pairing and to facilitate lung protective ventilation, Stiers et al. founded the \nconcept of Individualized Shared Ven tilation (ISV). The modified ventilator circuit, ISV -circuit, allows for \nindividualization of tidal volumes by using a flow restrictor, adding PEEP, and adjusting oxygen fraction. \n(REF) These crucial ventilation parameters are the cornerstone of lung prote ctive ventilation and the \nproper management of different patients with an evolving disease severity. (REF) Nevertheless, the \nindividualization of the ventilation volumes was still difficult, due to a very short regulation interval of the \ntidal volumes with  the existing diaphragm valve. (REF) To overcome this problem, we aim to develop a \n3D-printed flow restrictor that allows precise and predictable titration of tidal volumes. Shared Ventilation \nwas already an existing domain and regained interest due to the  COVID -19 pandemic, however, the \nconcept of ISV is novel, and our research group was at the roots with a pioneering proof of concept. \nCOVID -19 clarified that ventilator surge capacity is a very actual problem. In addition, many other \nsituations with an inc reasing incidence, such as terrorist attacks, casualties in military operations and \ndisaster situations of any kind, can result in a ventilator surge capacity problem. Although this is often \n \n2 temporary in high -income countries, in low -income countries resou rces are scarce on a daily basis. At this \nmoment, there is no certified ventilator circuit available that allows for ISV, neither there is a profound \nscientific evaluation of ISV carried out. This results in an ongoing discussion on this topic concerning: the \nindividualization per patient, safety and monitoring, indications, and the ethical aspects. The RESCIUS -\nproject has the aim to develop a validated ISV -circuit, with a 3D -printed flow restrictor, conform a medical \nIIb device and a clinical protocol enab ling the physician to safely use the ISV -technology clinically. ISV \nwill be a daily game changer in developing countries and a fire -extinguisher on the wall for the Western \nWorld. ? General hypothesis and specific aims of the project The overall hypothesis  of this research \nproject is that it is feasible and safe to individualize tidal volumes, PEEP and oxygen fraction with the ISV -\ncircuit and newly developed 3D -printed flow restrictor in vitro and that ISV can be used safely in \ncombination with our ISV -protocol in a large animal model. The RESCIUS -project scientifically aims to: 1)\n Design and develop a 3D -printed flow restrictor 2)  Verification and validation of the 3D -\nprinted flow restrictor in vitro and in vivo 3)  Investigate the feasibility, safety, and p erformance of \nISV in vitro and in vivo 4)  develop a clinical protocol.  We will use the following outcome \nparameters: 1) accurate delivery of individualized tidal volumes, PEEP, and FiO2% according to ventilator \nsettings, 2) precise in bench interaction be tween ventilator settings and ISV -circuit, 3) in vivo interaction \nbetween ISV -circuit and animal model (ventilation and oxygenation, VILI and hemodynamics).  Research \nmethodology Two distinct consecutive studies are planned to achieve the proposed research  objectives \ndivided into 4 work packages: an in vitro bench study and an in vivo study with a large animal model. We \nwill use a Dräger Savina 300 ICU -ventilator dedicated to the project. Data collection in vitro is provided by \nthe Citrix H5 and in vivo by the FluxMed GrE. These devices are high -end ISO -certified monitors and will \nnot be part of the validated ISV -circuit. Bench study with artificial lungs The Citrix H5 registers all the \nrelevant ventilation parameters every 20ms, for at least 30 breath cycle s to be statistically significant. \nData will be synchronized by LabView and analyzed using MATLAB software. The artificial lungs (IMT, \nSmart2000) can simulate different lung pathologies by adjusting the airway resistance and lung \ncompliance.  In vivo study  with a large animal model Domestic pigs will be used, ethical approval will be \nfiled after completion of WP 1. ARDS will be induced by a 2 -hit model following our in -house ARDS -\nprotocol and will give a stable mechanical animal model with different levels of lung injury. Data collection \nwill be done using the FluxMed GrE, monitoring vital parameters, arterial blood gas analyses, lung \nimaging and biomarkers after bronchial lavage. We estimate, based on previous experiment within the \nlab, that we will need a maximum of 36 domestic pigs with a worst -case ARDS induced mortality of 50%. \nPower calculation for the protocol development can be done after WP2. •  Work package 1 (WP 1): \nOptimization of the ISV -circuit Goal: to develop a 3D -printed flow restrictor confor m the intended use as a \nmedical IIb device and design inputs. This R&D and bench testing will be performed in collaboration with \nthe research laboratory of prof. ir. Benoît Marinus (RMA). Deliverables:  1)  Prototype of the 3D -\nprinted flow -restrictor 2)  Bench testing with design freeze of the 3D -printed flow restrictor    •  Work \npackage 2 (WP 2): Flow restrictor verification and validation. Goal: to verify and validate the flow restrictor \nagainst the intended use, conform regulatory requirements of a medical  IIb device.  Deliverable:  1)\n Verification and validation process in vitro and in vivo, conform medical IIb device. 2)  Final \n3D-printed flow restrictor, printed by external partner, Materialise. •  Work package 3 (WP 3): ISV \nvalidation and pre -clinical pro tocol development Goals: 1)  Individualize tidal volumes, PEEP, and \noxygen with our optimized ISV -circuit in bench. 2)  Define a pre -clinical ISV -protocol that can be \n \n3 used to manage healthy lungs in bench. 3)  Define a clinical protocol for different types of  lung injury \nin bench. Deliverables: 1)  ISV-matrix describing the interrelationship between ventilator in \npressure -controlled mode, the ISV -circuit, and the test lungs. 2)  Pre-clinical protocol enabling the testing \nof different clinical situations in bench  for the management of various types of lung injury.  3)  Clinical \nprotocol V1.0 based on the pre -clinical protocol tests, ready for in vivo transition. •  Work package \n4 (WP 4): In vivo transition and clinical protocol validation. Goals: 1)  Individualize ti dal volumes, \nPEEP, and oxygen with our optimized ISV -circuit in a large animal model and obtain stable ventilation \nparameters for twelve hours of ventilation. 2)  Indicate the severity of ARDS (mild, moderate, and \nsevere) our ISV -protocol can manage. Delive rable: a clinical protocol V2.0 ready for first in human \ntransition, stating the indications, the limitations and how to set the ventilator and the ISV -circuit to \nmanage different patients. Challenges and fallback options: As our research group already com pleted an \nin vitro and in vivo experiment and developed a proof of concept, we have an enormous expertise \nadvantage. The transition from in vitro bench to an in vivo large animal model is a critical step within the \nproject. To minimize the risk of animal m ortality we will work with an increasing level of ARDS severity \nand quantify the level of ARDS the ISV technology can manage.  \nInstitution: KU Leuven  \n \n1. GENERAL INFORMATION  \nName of the project lead (PI)  \nProf. dr. Marc Sabbe  \n \nInternal Funds Project number & title  \nIOF C3:  C3/21/074  \nRESCIUS -project:   \nResponding to the ventilator surge capacity problem   \nraised during the COVID -19 crisis by designing   \nIndividualized Shared Ventilation   \n \n \n2. DATA DESCRIPTION  \n2.1. Will you generate/collect new data and/or  make use of existing data?  \n● Generate new data  \n \n2.2. What data will you collect, generate or reuse? Describe the origin, type and format of the data \n(per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a numbered list or table and per \nobjective  of the project.  \nIn vitro  \nType of data  Format  Volume  How \n \n4 created  \nVentilation parameters  .csv 500 GB  Citrix H5  \nMetadata  .csv 150 GB  Google \nforms  \nIn vivo   \nType of data  Format  Volume  How \ncreated  \nVentilation parameters  .csv 100 GB  FluxMed  \nMetadata  .csv 100 GB  Google \nforms  \nAnimal in vivo parameters  .csv 75 GB  FluxMed, \narterial \nblood gas \nanalysis.  \n \n \n \n3. ETHICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES  \n3.1. Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add \nthe reference to the file in KU Leuven's Record of Processing Activities. Be aware that registering \nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.  \nNot applicable.  \n \n3.2. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the dat a (e.g. experiments \non humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant \nethical review committee(s).  \nThe project is in cooperation with the Royal Military Academy and there is a dual -use aspect being for \nhumanit arian purposes in disaster situations. This has already been reported through the LRD colleagues \nand is being looked into further by them.  \nThe in vitro trials do not require any applications to the ethics committee. As soon as these in vitro tests \nare com pleted, we can switch to in vivo and these applications will be added to the DMP.  \n \n \n5 3.3. Does your research possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and \nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so,  for what data and \nwhich restrictions will be asserted?  \nThe RESCIUS -project benefits from C3 funding and is by definition focused on valorisation. On the one \nhand, there is an optimisation of the ISV circuit with the development of the flow modulator in co operation \nwith the RMA. On the other hand, there is the development of the clinical protocol, which will increase \nclinical uptake and utilisation of the ISV technology.  \nThe valorisation component is monitored in close cooperation with LRD and our consulta nts Qserve and \nInnovHealth. The research team is also following an MBA bootcamp at the Flanders Business School to \nwrite a business proposition.  \nNo results are published without the express consent of LRD after a review process. If it is decided, as \ndescr ibed above, to make the data publicly available, we will make use of the Research Data Repository \n(RDR) from KU Leuven.  \nThe flow modulator is currently under patent evaluation.  \nAs soon as there is clarity in the business strategy and the valorisation trac k, we strive to make the \ndatabase as publicly accessible as possible, without prejudice to the valorisation track.  \n \n3.4. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you \n(re)use? If so, to what data do they relate an d what restrictions regarding reuse and sharing are in \nplace?  \nThe RESCIUS -project is an interdisciplinary and interuniversity collaboration in which KU Leuven, the \nresearch unit of emergency medicine, has the lead.    \nIn the event that an additional party j oins the RESCIUS group as part of the valorisation process, this will \nalways be covered by the above -mentioned approach. All other parties will be appointed as \nsubcontractors and will not be able to prevent the RESCIUS group from data sharing or publicatio n, once \nit has decided to do so.  \n \n \n4.

To minimize the risk of animal m ortality we will work with an increasing level of ARDS severity and quantify the level of ARDS the ISV technology can manage. Institution: KU Leuven 1. GENERAL INFORMATION Name of the project lead (PI) Prof. dr. Marc Sabbe Internal Funds Project number & title IOF C3: C3/21/074 RESCIUS -project: Responding to the ventilator surge capacity problem raised during the COVID -19 crisis by designing Individualized Shared Ventilation 2. DATA DESCRIPTION 2.1. Will you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data? ● Generate new data 2.2. What data will you collect, generate or reuse? Describe the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a numbered list or table and per objective of the project. In vitro Type of data Format Volume How 4 created Ventilation parameters .csv 500 GB Citrix H5 Metadata .csv 150 GB Google forms In vivo Type of data Format Volume How created Ventilation parameters .csv 100 GB FluxMed Metadata .csv 100 GB Google forms Animal in vivo parameters .csv 75 GB FluxMed, arterial blood gas analysis. 3. ETHICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES 3.1. Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add the reference to the file in KU Leuven's Record of Processing Activities. Be aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation. Not applicable. 3.2. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the dat a (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant ethical review committee(s). The project is in cooperation with the Royal Military Academy and there is a dual -use aspect being for humanit arian purposes in disaster situations. This has already been reported through the LRD colleagues and is being looked into further by them. The in vitro trials do not require any applications to the ethics committee. As soon as these in vitro tests are com pleted, we can switch to in vivo and these applications will be added to the DMP. 5 3.3. Does your research possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted? The RESCIUS -project benefits from C3 funding and is by definition focused on valorisation. On the one hand, there is an optimisation of the ISV circuit with the development of the flow modulator in co operation with the RMA. On the other hand, there is the development of the clinical protocol, which will increase clinical uptake and utilisation of the ISV technology. The valorisation component is monitored in close cooperation with LRD and our consulta nts Qserve and InnovHealth. The research team is also following an MBA bootcamp at the Flanders Business School to write a business proposition. No results are published without the express consent of LRD after a review process. If it is decided, as descr ibed above, to make the data publicly available, we will make use of the Research Data Repository (RDR) from KU Leuven. The flow modulator is currently under patent evaluation. As soon as there is clarity in the business strategy and the valorisation trac k, we strive to make the database as publicly accessible as possible, without prejudice to the valorisation track. 3.4. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate an d what restrictions regarding reuse and sharing are in place? The RESCIUS -project is an interdisciplinary and interuniversity collaboration in which KU Leuven, the research unit of emergency medicine, has the lead. In the event that an additional party j oins the RESCIUS group as part of the valorisation process, this will always be covered by the above -mentioned approach. All other parties will be appointed as subcontractors and will not be able to prevent the RESCIUS group from data sharing or publicatio n, once it has decided to do so. 4.

DATA STORAGE AND BACKUP DURING THE PROJECT 5.1. Where will the data be stored? The time -stamped master copy of the data will be kept on the One Drive acco unt in the safe KU Leuven environment. Copies can be made and kept on personal devices. The planned 2 TB of One Drive space will be enough to store the data. 5.2. How will the data be backed up? The data will be stored on the university's central serv ers with automatic daily back -up procedures. 8 5.3. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. The planned 2 TB of One Drive space will be enough to store the data. 5.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How will these costs be covered? The planned 2 TB of One Drive space will be enough to stor e the data. 5.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?

DATA PRESERVATION AFTER THE END OF THE PROJECT 6.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the project? If only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state w hy this is the case (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...). The dataset and the ISV -matrix will be retained for at least 10 years. The constructed ISV matrix can also be useful for experimental research by the colleagues of Leuven.AI. 6.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)? The data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back -up procedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. 6.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How will the costs be covered? The data of the RESCIUS project will not exceed the planned space of 2 TB. 7. DATA SHARING AND RE -USE 7.1. Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions or because of IP potential)?
