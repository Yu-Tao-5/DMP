For hospitalized patients who are subsequently admitted to a rehabilitation program,\nthis level is not the level of functioning that they had before the pathology. Therefore, restrictions are still present when patients are discharged from\nthe rehabilitation centre to the home situation. And although further improvement is possible in this chronic phase, rehabilitation options are limited.\nThis results in little to no further progress and negatively impacts life after stroke and spinal cord injury .\nAdvanced rehabilitation technology enables intensive rehabilitation and positively affects upper and lower limb function. However, several economic\nfactors, including the lack of adequate evaluations of cost-effectiveness and current reimbursement models, are hampering the widespread use of this\ninnovative technology in rehabilitation. This makes rehabilitation in the chronic phase inaccessible and ineffective.  \nThis project will consist of 1 large clinical trial with 2 core concepts: (1) Clinical benefits of an intensive rehabilitation programme using advanced\ntechnology, compared to the control group; (2) A full health economic evaluation combined with model-based estimation of costs and benefits; (3) A \nprocess evaluation. \nKnowledge about these core concepts of intensive rehabilitation using advanced technology will allow us to develop a better rehabilitation package for\npatients after stroke and spinal cord injury and will have an impact on the implementation of advanced technology within rehabilitation.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n15-02-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Advanced rehabilitation technology enables intensive rehabilitation and positively affects upper and lower limb function. However, several economic factors, including the lack of adequate evaluations of cost-effectiveness and current reimbursement models, are hampering the widespread use of this innovative technology in rehabilitation. This makes rehabilitation in the chronic phase inaccessible and ineffective. This project will consist of 1 large clinical trial with 2 core concepts: (1) Clinical benefits of an intensive rehabilitation programme using advanced technology, compared to the control group; (2) A full health economic evaluation combined with model-based estimation of costs and benefits; (3) A process evaluation. Knowledge about these core concepts of intensive rehabilitation using advanced technology will allow us to develop a better rehabilitation package for patients after stroke and spinal cord injury and will have an impact on the implementation of advanced technology within rehabilitation.
