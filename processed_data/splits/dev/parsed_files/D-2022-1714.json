The data are in the form of mathematical statements (theorems, examples,...) and\nare obtained by the members of the project.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. General Information\nName applicant\nMarco Zambon\nFWO Project Number & Title\nEOS project G0I2222N (EOS ID: 40007524)\nAffiliation\nKU Leuven\nThis project has 3 PI's:\n- Joel Fine (ULB)\n- Sonja Hohloch (Universiteit Antwerpen)\n- Marco Zambon (KU Leuven)\nIt also has 3 co-PI's:\n- Melanie Bertelson (ULB)\n- Bruno Premoselli (ULB)\n- Joeri van der Veken (KU Leuven)\n2. Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nThis research involves no data collection.\nThe output data is in the format of paper notes and Latex/PDF files.\nLatex files are very small, typically around 200 KB, and the corresponding PDF files are about\n1MB.\n3. Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNo\nPrivacy Registry Reference:\nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used:\nNone\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)?

If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nThe data generated are in the forms of mathematical theorems. The explanation of the steps\ntaken to obtain and prove the theorems, as well as their general context, will form part of the\nintroduction of the corresponding publication.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nYes\nThe research papers will be typeset in Latex, a softwared designed for mathematical text and\nformulas. Typically, before a paper reaches its final form (the one in which it is accepted for\npublication), it is preceeded by several versions, which can be considered metadata for the\nproject. These versions are upoaded to the preprint server ArXiv.org, both in Latex and PDF\nformat, and remain available there.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nThe output data will be stored on the computers of the PI Marco Zambon, and one to the servers\nto which they will be backed up.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe output data will be stored either on servers, using applications provided by the university\nsuch as OneDrive, or using similar applications.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project?
