They encompass inborn errors of immunity (IEI), such as STAT1 gain-of-function (GOF), hereditary angioedema (HAE), as well\nas anaphylaxis, all potentially life-threatening conditions. Detailed knowledge on disease mechanism in most adults with IEI is lacking and\ndiagnostic tools for rare causes of anaphylaxis often insufficient.\nThis FWO mandate has 4 objectives: (I) to elucidate the molecular determinants of IEI in adults; (II) improve insights in the\npathophysiology of STAT1 GOF and its responsiveness to JAKinhibitors as well as developing a gene therapeutic approach for STAT1\nGOF; (III) explore endothelial (dys)function in different forms of HAE and provide a comparison with histamine-induced angioedema; (IV)\ngenerate improved diagnostic tools for rare causes of anaphylaxis and evaluate the impact of environmental nitrogen deposition on the\nallergenicity of plant pollen and vegetable food. By focusing on extreme clinical manifestations, this FWO mandate not only aims to\nimprove the individual care of patients confronted with a rare disease, but also to contribute significantly to our overall knowledge in\nallergy and immunology. Finally, we will provide crucial insights in a hitherto unrecognized environmental parameter, nitrogen\ndeposition.\nLast modified: \n13-04-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

A Data Management Plan created using DMPonline.be Creator: Rik Schrijvers Affiliation: KU Leuven (KUL) Funder: Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) Template: FWO DMP (Flemish Standard DMP) Data Manager: Rik Schrijvers, n.n. n.n. Grant number / URL: 1805523N ID: 198614 Start date: 01-10-2022 End date: 30-09-2027 Project abstract: Exploring rare manifestations in allergy and clinical immunology is an unmet need for most patients and can provide seminal insights for the field. They encompass inborn errors of immunity (IEI), such as STAT1 gain-of-function (GOF), hereditary angioedema (HAE), as well as anaphylaxis, all potentially life-threatening conditions. Detailed knowledge on disease mechanism in most adults with IEI is lacking and diagnostic tools for rare causes of anaphylaxis often insufficient. This FWO mandate has 4 objectives: (I) to elucidate the molecular determinants of IEI in adults; (II) improve insights in the pathophysiology of STAT1 GOF and its responsiveness to JAKinhibitors as well as developing a gene therapeutic approach for STAT1 GOF; (III) explore endothelial (dys)function in different forms of HAE and provide a comparison with histamine-induced angioedema; (IV) generate improved diagnostic tools for rare causes of anaphylaxis and evaluate the impact of environmental nitrogen deposition on the allergenicity of plant pollen and vegetable food. By focusing on extreme clinical manifestations, this FWO mandate not only aims to improve the individual care of patients confronted with a rare disease, but also to contribute significantly to our overall knowledge in allergy and immunology. Finally, we will provide crucial insights in a hitherto unrecognized environmental parameter, nitrogen deposition. Last modified: 13-04-2023 Created using DMPonline.be.
