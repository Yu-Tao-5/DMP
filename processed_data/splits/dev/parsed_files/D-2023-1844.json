CDG can be caused by the disruption of\nmany aspects of cell biology, from those caused by defects in enzymes catalyzing glycan transfer to those that affect the function of\nentire organelles, leading to indirect disruption of glycosylation pathways.\nThis project details the study of two CDG newly identified in our lab. The first of these, DHRSX deficiency, is thought to disrupt the\nmetabolism of dolichol. This is a lipid used as a sugar/glycan carrier for the attachment and formation of N-glycans, as well as having\nother functions that are poorly understood, such as in the membranes of various organelles. We expect to identify a completely novel\nstep in dolichol metabolism. DHRSX deficiency will also become the first identified truly pseudo-autosomal recessive disorder in human\ngenetics.\nThe second disorder, caused by mutations in CAMLG, is a defect of the transmembrane domain recognition complex (TRC) pathway,\nrequired for the insertion of tail-anchored (TA) proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Researching the mechanism by which\nmutations in CAMLG lead to a CDG will reveal important information about both the TRC pathway and protein trafficking.\nIn summary, this project will take two diverse novel disorders and use their study to not only describe new aspects of human disease, but\nalso to reveal fundamental and exciting aspects of cell biology.\nLast modified: \n28-04-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Digital data is either stored on the KU Leuven\nOneDrive or ManGO and can be freely accessed by researchers there.\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? Describe these issues in the comment section.\nPlease refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate.\nYes, human subject data\nThe project involves human subjects who are affected by several Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG). Cells derived from primary biopsies will be studied (dermal fibroblasts and EBV-\nimmortalized lymphoblasts). These samples were collected under previous projects (EUROGLYCAN-omics and CELSA/21/027 that allowed the reuse of these samples for future projects within\nthe same lab.\nConsent for data retention and sharing with other researchers has been (or will be) obtained from each of the study participants. This consent is through the EUROGLYCAN-omics or\nCELSA/21/027 projects informed consent forms which have been approved by the KU Leuven Ethics Commission.\nFor the publication of manuscripts detailing clinical features, it is also clearly necessary to collect personal (clinical) data from participants, as well as images. This is also detailed in the informed\nconsents mentioned above.\nWill you process personal data? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate.\nYes\nBecause patient-derived cells and next-generation sequencing data will be studied, it is impossible to fully anonymise this data as genetic information can theoretically always be linked back to the\noriginal patient. Personal data will therefore be pseudonymized. \nA PRET application will be submitted at KU Leuven and full ethics approval thorugh the UZ/KU Leuven ethics commission is pending.\nDoes your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type\nwhere appropriate.\nNo\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements/ research collaboration agreements)? If so,\nplease explain in the comment section to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.\nYes\nSpecifically for the study of DHRSX a material transfer agreement is in place between KU Leuven and The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto for the study of patient samples (S58358 - R7363). \nAre there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use?

Documentation and Metadata\nClearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in\nthe future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is\nrecorded).\nExperimental data will be stored in a clearly labelled filesystem on ManGO. Metadata will be stored in an Excel file, noting the pseudonymised codes (see below) assigned to each individual\nstudied, the datasets as they have been integrated and the structure of the filesystem used, as well as the formats of each individual piece of experimental data.\nPatients and their individual data will be pseudonymised using 'GC codes' assigned by the UZ Leuven Genomics Core service, who will perform NGS; these are stored in another secure separate\nmetadata document in the Microsoft Excel format. In addition, for datasets uploaded to RD-Connect, persistent IDs are also generated.\nIdentifiers will be in the pseudonymised format GCxxxxxx, with the 6 digit xxxxxx code corresponding to a fixed number assigned by Genomics Core. Data for each of these patients will be stored\nin a folder under this name, with each experiment run using their data clearly stored underneath this master file (e.g. WGS, RNAseq, CHIPSeq). Bioinficatics pipelines used for data analysis will\nalso save experiments according to the date the analysis was performed (e.g. 280423_1613_RNASeq). Combined datasets will be stored according to the date that the experiment was created\nand a description of the analysis performed (e.g. April2023_RNAseq). Inside this folder, a metadata document in Excel format will contain each of the experiments integrated into this combined\nanalysis dataset. This data will all be stored on the Google Cloud storage system.\nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be\nused. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.\nYes\nData deposited in the KU Leuven RDR will use DataCite as the metadata standard.\nOther experimental metadata will be stored in an Excel file, noting the pseudonymised codes (see below) assigned to each individual studied, the datasets as they have been integrated and the\nstructure of the filesystem used, as well as the formats of each individual piece of experimental data.\nFor data uploaded to RD-Connect, data will also be findable there.\n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nShort-term non-personal data will be stored on the KU Leuven OneDrive assigned to researchers on the project.\nLarger data sets (e.g. Next generation sequencing data) will be stored on the KU Leuven ManGO data storage service. \nManGO will also be used as a backup for smaller datasets regarded to be important to share securely (e.g. .tif files created by confocal microscopy or chemiluminescence imaging)\nHow will the data be backed up?\nBoth the KU Leuven OneDrive and ManGO storage systems have redundancy that means backups are automatically created or data is stored in multiple secure locations. Some smaller data (NB\nnot larger datasets which are unsuitable for OneDrive storage) will also be kept in both of these storage systems.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nYes, ManGO has sufficient storage for the datasets produced and these are extended (and paid for) on a pro-rata basis.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nBoth OneDrive for business and ManGO are secured using the KU Leuven data security systems and authentication.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nOneDrive for business is free for researchers based at KU Leuven.\nManGO costs are estimated at 35 EUR/TB/Year. The research group currently uses approximately 4TB and during this project no more than a total of 5TB additional data for ManGO storage is\nexpected to be produced. This would mean a maximum cost by the end of the project of 315 EUR per year. These costs are relatively minor and can be paid by the fellow's bench fees during the\nproject. After the project has been completed, the costs can be paid by existing grants within the laboratory of Gert Matthijs.\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be\npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\nExperimental NGS data will be stored for 30 years as per UZ Leuven guidelines. Derived experimental data will be stored on the ManGo servers for at least 5 years, conforming to the Leuven\nRDP policy.\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 28 April 2023\n6 of 8\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nManGO KU Leuven storage volumes and price (35 EUR/TB/year) mean that this is a feasible location for long-term storage of the data. ManGO allows the inclusion of metadata and the\npreservation of file systems for easy access and curation.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nManGO has costs of 35 EUR/TB/year. Since we expect to produce a total of approximately 5TB data during the project, long-term storage costs are not large and can be covered by future\nresearch grants within the laboratory.\n5. Data sharing and reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made\navailable.\nYes, in an Open Access repository\nYes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …)\nWhole genome and RNA-Seq data will be made available by uploading it to the RD-Connect (https://rd-connect.eu/) platform. This will allow researchers (i.e. other verified users of the RD-\nConnect platform) that agree to certain terms and conditions free and open access to the data collected. Specifically, Fastq files will be provided to RD-Connect.  This restricted access repository\nis necessary due to the personal nature of the data shared.\nOther data directly relevant to publications, and the publications themselves, will be made open access in their respective journals. In addition, data necessary for replication of experiments but not\nshared directly in a publication will be shared in the KU Leuven Research Data Repository (RDR).\nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.\nData shared in RD-Connect can only be accessed by academics who have registered and been verified by the platform.\nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment\nsection per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nYes, Privacy aspects\nYes, Ethical aspects\nPersonal data derived from next generation sequencing technologies cannot be shared openly and will only be openly usable within the framework of RD-Connect. This fully anonymises the data\nand allows access only to registered and trusted scientific professionals.\nWhere will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.\nWhole genome and RNA-Seq data will be made available by uploading it to the RD-Connect (https://rd-connect.eu/) platform.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nAfter the end of the project an embargo of 6 months will be applied to the data as laid down in the 3rd party agreement; this is also valid for data shared on RD-Connect. After this it will be made\navailable.\nWhich data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why.\nData shared in the KU Leuven RDR will be available under at CC-BY-4.0 license.\nDo you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section.\nYes\nKU Leuven RDR uses DOIs and one will be assigned to any datasets uploaded there.\nManuscripts produced during the project will receive DOIs upon publication.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nThe small amount of data in RDR will be free. RD-Connect is also free.\n6.

Both OneDrive for business and ManGO are secured using the KU Leuven data security systems and authentication. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? OneDrive for business is free for researchers based at KU Leuven. ManGO costs are estimated at 35 EUR/TB/Year. The research group currently uses approximately 4TB and during this project no more than a total of 5TB additional data for ManGO storage is expected to be produced. This would mean a maximum cost by the end of the project of 315 EUR per year. These costs are relatively minor and can be paid by the fellow's bench fees during the project. After the project has been completed, the costs can be paid by existing grants within the laboratory of Gert Matthijs. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Experimental NGS data will be stored for 30 years as per UZ Leuven guidelines. Derived experimental data will be stored on the ManGo servers for at least 5 years, conforming to the Leuven RDP policy. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 28 April 2023 6 of 8 Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? ManGO KU Leuven storage volumes and price (35 EUR/TB/year) mean that this is a feasible location for long-term storage of the data. ManGO allows the inclusion of metadata and the preservation of file systems for easy access and curation. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? ManGO has costs of 35 EUR/TB/year. Since we expect to produce a total of approximately 5TB data during the project, long-term storage costs are not large and can be covered by future research grants within the laboratory. 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in an Open Access repository Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) Whole genome and RNA-Seq data will be made available by uploading it to the RD-Connect (https://rd-connect.eu/) platform. This will allow researchers (i.e. other verified users of the RD- Connect platform) that agree to certain terms and conditions free and open access to the data collected. Specifically, Fastq files will be provided to RD-Connect. This restricted access repository is necessary due to the personal nature of the data shared. Other data directly relevant to publications, and the publications themselves, will be made open access in their respective journals. In addition, data necessary for replication of experiments but not shared directly in a publication will be shared in the KU Leuven Research Data Repository (RDR). If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Data shared in RD-Connect can only be accessed by academics who have registered and been verified by the platform. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes, Privacy aspects Yes, Ethical aspects Personal data derived from next generation sequencing technologies cannot be shared openly and will only be openly usable within the framework of RD-Connect. This fully anonymises the data and allows access only to registered and trusted scientific professionals. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. Whole genome and RNA-Seq data will be made available by uploading it to the RD-Connect (https://rd-connect.eu/) platform. When will the data be made available? After the end of the project an embargo of 6 months will be applied to the data as laid down in the 3rd party agreement; this is also valid for data shared on RD-Connect. After this it will be made available. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. Data shared in the KU Leuven RDR will be available under at CC-BY-4.0 license. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. Yes KU Leuven RDR uses DOIs and one will be assigned to any datasets uploaded there. Manuscripts produced during the project will receive DOIs upon publication. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? The small amount of data in RDR will be free. RD-Connect is also free. 6.
