The FWO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.  At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.        \n FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven       2  1.

Applications range from electron structure computations to machine learning. This class of eigenvalue problems is challenging as they are inherently nonlinear while the concept of linearization, in the sense of an equivalent, possibly infinite-dimensional linear representation, is not clear. As a consequence, the basis theory is incomplete, while the available algorithms almost exclusively rely on a fixed point iteration whose global convergence properties are only understood in specific cases. At the same time, the literature is limited and scattered over different domains. The aim of the project is to develop structure exploiting algorithms for eigenvector nonlinearities with strong theoretical foundations. First, multivariable rational approximations will be constructed that induce spectrally equivalent linear problems. Second, global algorithms will be developed, able to reliably compute all eigenvalues in a prescribed region or interval. Third, using projection these algorithms will be scaled up to large-scale matrices, which is essential to bridge methods and applications. The methodology integrates techniques from rational approximation, algorithms for multi-parameter eigenvalues and methods from algebraic geometry, and it exploits the complementary expertise of the applicants.        \n FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven       4  2. Research Data Summary  List and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.
