The FWO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.  At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.        \n FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven       2  1.

How these animals have managed to exploit their invertebrate genome to construct a brain so large still remains enigmatic. Our lab previously showed that the central brain of Octopus vulgaris develops from a neurogenic zone around the eyes and deploys typical neurogenic transcription factors and extensive neural migration to grow a largely postmitotic larval brain. At hatching, the embryonic neurogenic zone is exhausted, yet the larval brain still needs to grow about a thousandfold in cell number to reach the adult size. In this project, we want to unravel the mechanisms driving the post-hatching growth phase of the octopus brain by revealing the stem cells and neural diversity they generate. By comparing different coleoid cephalopod brains at posthatching stage, we want to understand how different morphologies in cephalopod brain lobes arise. Together these findings might reveal innovative ways of evolutionary brain expansion.    1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number. This question is optional.

Documentation and Metadata  Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded).  RDM guidance on documentation and metadata.  We will maintain a record of the following for every WP (where applicable): - Experimental design and protocol (.docx file) - Abbreviations used (.docx file) - Structure of the data (.docx file) - Steps involved in data analysis and relevant analysis scripts ( R, MATLAB, Python and ImageJ scripts) - Raw data (specific file format according to data type) - Analysed data (specific file format according to data type) - Index file/read me file (.txt file) for every WP, linking the name, location (folder and subfolder on /server) and description of above-mentioned files. Physical data: Samples taken from experiments will be documented and stored for up to three years after the end of the project. Storage will be in fixative, in paraffin, at 4C or in freezers depending on the kind of sample. Immunohistological stained slides will be stored in appropriate boxes in a dry place or fridge. We deviate from the 5 years rule because after three years, quality of the physical samples cannot be guaranteed anymore. \n FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven       9  Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data?   If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.  REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.  ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used:   The experiments are unique, but the data will be standardized according to data-type across experiments to make it easier to interpret the structure. Below, we list the metadata standards applicable to this project: Metadata standards will be used for genomics (http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards/genome-metadata). For all other data, metadata will be created using the Dublin core (http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadatastandards/ dublin-core).    4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project  Where will the data be stored?  Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data. ☒ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☒ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☐ Other  How will the data be backed up?  WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS?  ☒ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☒ Back-ups on personal KU Leuven OneDrive ☐ Other (specify)     \n FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven       10  Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No  There is currently sufficient storage at KU Leuven ICTS.  How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?  CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE.  Guidance on security for research data   Researchers involved in the project can control who they give access to the files on their personal OneDrive. To access the KU Leuven servers, access is provided and controlled by the group leader, Eve Seuntjens. The KU Leuven ICTS data center hosts the network storage, with a mirror available in the second ICTS center. This ensures additional back-up capacity, recovery of lost data and long term data availability. The access is controlled by KU Leuven security groups and it is password protected.  What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Personal and Shared network drive (I, J) 503,66 euro/TB per year. All large primary data will be moved to LVS. LVS storage costs per 5 Tb (KU Leuven ICTS): 104,42euro/year. Expected amount of data (50TB). The costs have been budgeted on the grant.    5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project  \n FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven       11  Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this  (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).  Guidance on data preservation ☐ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☒ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain)  Digital data:  We will retain all data for the expected 10 year period. We expect that we will make the data publicly available on data repositories upon publication of the manuscripts.  Physical data: Samples taken from experiments will be documented and stored for up to three years after the end of the project. We deviate from the 10 years rule because after three years, quality of the physical samples cannot be guaranteed anymore.  Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?  Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide. ☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specifiy):  Digital data will be stored at the Archive (K:) server from KU Leuven ICTS. HCR probes and physical samples will be stored in the freezers from the Research Group of Developmental Neurobiology. Code scripts will be stored on Github.  What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?   We expect the costs to gradually increase up to 3000 euro/year. After the project, data preservation costs will be covered by other grants.   \n FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven       12  6. Data Sharing and Reuse  Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?   Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available.

Below, we list the metadata standards applicable to this project: Metadata standards will be used for genomics (http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards/genome-metadata). For all other data, metadata will be created using the Dublin core (http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadatastandards/ dublin-core). 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data. ☒ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☒ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☐ Other How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? ☒ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☒ Back-ups on personal KU Leuven OneDrive ☐ Other (specify) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10 Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No There is currently sufficient storage at KU Leuven ICTS. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data Researchers involved in the project can control who they give access to the files on their personal OneDrive. To access the KU Leuven servers, access is provided and controlled by the group leader, Eve Seuntjens. The KU Leuven ICTS data center hosts the network storage, with a mirror available in the second ICTS center. This ensures additional back-up capacity, recovery of lost data and long term data availability. The access is controlled by KU Leuven security groups and it is password protected. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Personal and Shared network drive (I, J) 503,66 euro/TB per year. All large primary data will be moved to LVS. LVS storage costs per 5 Tb (KU Leuven ICTS): 104,42euro/year. Expected amount of data (50TB). The costs have been budgeted on the grant. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11 Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation ☐ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☒ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Digital data: We will retain all data for the expected 10 year period. We expect that we will make the data publicly available on data repositories upon publication of the manuscripts. Physical data: Samples taken from experiments will be documented and stored for up to three years after the end of the project. We deviate from the 10 years rule because after three years, quality of the physical samples cannot be guaranteed anymore. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide. ☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): Digital data will be stored at the Archive (K:) server from KU Leuven ICTS. HCR probes and physical samples will be stored in the freezers from the Research Group of Developmental Neurobiology. Code scripts will be stored on Github. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? We expect the costs to gradually increase up to 3000 euro/year. After the project, data preservation costs will be covered by other grants. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INFOEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☐ Yes, as open data ☒ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☐ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: The data will be made available after publication via the required link in the publications or upon request after an embargo period after publication (f.i. phenotype files, genetic data). The same holds true for unpublished data, they can be made available upon request but only after an embargo period (3 years; exceptionally 5 years after the project). If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. All team members have access as long as they are affiliated to KU Leuven. Once all files are released, anyone can use these data to generate new results, referring to the original publication and not for commercial use. Other data will be only released upon request and after an embargo period after publication. Data will be released under a CC-BY 4.0 reuse license. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13 Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. ☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Other data repository (specify) ☒ Other (specify) Experimental data will be made available through a data repository such as ncbi, github, Genbank, FigShare (https://figshare.com/), Dryad ( https://datadryad.org/) or https://zenodo.org/depending on the type of data. We will explore the possibilities via online repositories and will use the website www.re3data.org. When will the data be made available? ☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. Check the RDR guidance on licences for data and software sources code or consult the License selector tool to help you choose. ☒ CC-BY 4.0 (data) ☐ Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) ☐ MIT licence (code) ☐ GNU GPL-3.0 (code) ☐ Other (specify) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 14 Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA. ☒ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☐ No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? The transfer costs depend on the data repository selected. Costs will be covered by the project funding. 7.
