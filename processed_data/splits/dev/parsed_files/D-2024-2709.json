The F WO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official  start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel.  Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.  \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation  Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders \nand research institutions.  This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary  of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link.  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        2 \n 1.

Most of these  \nenzymes do not function in isolation but as part of multi -subunit complexes. Among HDAC machineries, \nthe evolutionarily conser ved Sin3 HDAC complex is involved in various cellular processes and diseases. \nHowever, the molecular assemblies of the Sin3 HDAC complexes remain poorly understood with limited \nknowledge on how the 3D organization of their subunits can impact diverse functions. Here, to address \nthis question, we use single -particle cryogenic -electron microscopy (cryo -EM) and integrative modelling \napproaches to determine high -resolution 3D structures of the co nserved Sin3/Rpd3 HDAC complexes from \nyeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . These structures and subunit interaction mapping information will serve \nas a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms behind HDAC complex -mediated \ntranscriptional regulation  in eukaryotes, and how these epigenetic molecular machines can be \nreprogrammed for therapeutic interventions.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        4 \n 2.

In addition to this, digital data is also stored on KU Leuven \nOneDrive , which can only be accessed by me . These drives are centrally managed by KU Leuven ICTS  and \nhave a built -in back -up capacity guaranteeing long -term availability of the data as well as recovery, if \nneeded.  \nCryo -EM data  will be saved on an in -line server (Athena) and will be backed -up on ex ternal 600TB server \nand a new  1.2PB server available in our lab.  \nNotebooks and other hard copy material  (including printed protocols) will be stored physically in the \nlaboratory.  \n \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        14 \n How will the data be backed up?  \n \nWHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO \nPREVENT DATA LOSS ?  ☒ Standard back -up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution . \n☒ Personal back -ups I make (specify)  \n☐ Other (specify)  \n \nAll digital data  (except cryo -EM data) is automatically backed -up when stored on drives managed by KU \nLeuven, including  the J -drive or KU Leuven OneDrive . On the faculty network J -drives, “snapshot” \ntechnology is used to actively back -up files are different timestamps. A mirror copy of all the data is stored \nin a second data center as well, to prevent data loss . This occurs every hour, which allows restoration of \ndata to within the hour in case the primary data center is compromised.  \nLarge -volume cryo -EM data  is backed -up on external 600TB capacity and 1.2PB RAID servers, both of \nwhich are available in our lab.  \n \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities  are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.  ☒ Yes \n☐ No \n \nIf yes, specify  concisely :  \nThe KU Leuven OneDrive provided to each staff member has a capacity of 2 TB, which is sufficient for the \nstorage of a ll digital data except for cryo -EM data. For cryo -EM data, the 600TB and 1.2PB external servers \nhave the capacity to store and backup the data as needed. Additionally, for  the storage of  cryo -EM data \ngenerated during the processing steps, an extra 60TB is ava ilable on the Vlaams Super computer Centrum \n(VSC) HPC.  \n \nHow will you ensure that the data are securely \nstored and not accessed or modified by \nunauthorized persons?  \n \nCLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , \nNETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURIT Y OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND \nFILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND \nTRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE .  \nGuidance on security for research data   \n The external drives can only be accessed by the computers in the lab, which require a KU Leuven account \nand password to log in. Therefore, unauthorized p eople cannot log in to the computers and access the \nexternal driv es. The shared J -drive  can also only be accessed by members of the lab using their lab PCs and \ntheir KU Leuven ID and passwords. Furthermore, at all these stages, two -factor authentication i s needed \nduring log in.  \n \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        15 \n What are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?  The external 600TB and 1.2PB data storage servers are already available in our lab and hence no costs are \nincurred with their use. The use of the shared J -drive amounts to €51.90/100GB/year, which is covered by \nthe laboratory. Additionally,  data stored on the HPC costs €20/TB/year, which with the current capacity of \n60TB costs €1200 which is covered by the host institution and the laboratory.  \n \n \n \n5. Data Preservation  after the end of the Research P roject  \n \nWhich data will be retained for at least five \nyears (or longer, in agreement with other \nretention policies that are applicable) after the \nend of the  project?

    "clean_full_text": "FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 1 FWO DMP Template - Flemish Standard Data Management Plan Version KU Leuven Project supervisors (from application round 2018 onwards) and fellows (from application round 2020 onwards) will, upon being awarded their project or fellowship, be invited to develop their answers to the data management related questions into a DMP. The F WO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.

FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 3 Please provide a short project description Histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes are the main transcriptional repressors in eukaryotes. Most of these enzymes do not function in isolation but as part of multi -subunit complexes. Among HDAC machineries, the evolutionarily conser ved Sin3 HDAC complex is involved in various cellular processes and diseases. However, the molecular assemblies of the Sin3 HDAC complexes remain poorly understood with limited knowledge on how the 3D organization of their subunits can impact diverse functions. Here, to address this question, we use single -particle cryogenic -electron microscopy (cryo -EM) and integrative modelling approaches to determine high -resolution 3D structures of the co nserved Sin3/Rpd3 HDAC complexes from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . These structures and subunit interaction mapping information will serve as a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms behind HDAC complex -mediated transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes, and how these epigenetic molecular machines can be reprogrammed for therapeutic interventions.

Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data. ☒ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☐ Personal network driv e (I-drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on -premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☒ Other: Digital data generated during the project (including, but not limited to, protocols, raw data, analysed data, images/movies, density maps and protein structures) will be stored on the shared network (J -drive) which restricts access to the members of the group. In addition to this, digital data is also stored on KU Leuven OneDrive , which can only be accessed by me . These drives are centrally managed by KU Leuven ICTS and have a built -in back -up capacity guaranteeing long -term availability of the data as well as recovery, if needed. Cryo -EM data will be saved on an in -line server (Athena) and will be backed -up on ex ternal 600TB server and a new 1.2PB server available in our lab. Notebooks and other hard copy material (including printed protocols) will be stored physically in the laboratory. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 14 How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? ☒ Standard back -up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution . ☒ Personal back -ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) All digital data (except cryo -EM data) is automatically backed -up when stored on drives managed by KU Leuven, including the J -drive or KU Leuven OneDrive . On the faculty network J -drives, “snapshot” technology is used to actively back -up files are different timestamps. A mirror copy of all the data is stored in a second data center as well, to prevent data loss . This occurs every hour, which allows restoration of data to within the hour in case the primary data center is compromised. Large -volume cryo -EM data is backed -up on external 600TB capacity and 1.2PB RAID servers, both of which are available in our lab. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, specify concisely : The KU Leuven OneDrive provided to each staff member has a capacity of 2 TB, which is sufficient for the storage of a ll digital data except for cryo -EM data. For cryo -EM data, the 600TB and 1.2PB external servers have the capacity to store and backup the data as needed. Additionally, for the storage of cryo -EM data generated during the processing steps, an extra 60TB is ava ilable on the Vlaams Super computer Centrum (VSC) HPC. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURIT Y OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . Guidance on security for research data The external drives can only be accessed by the computers in the lab, which require a KU Leuven account and password to log in. Therefore, unauthorized p eople cannot log in to the computers and access the external driv es. The shared J -drive can also only be accessed by members of the lab using their lab PCs and their KU Leuven ID and passwords. Furthermore, at all these stages, two -factor authentication i s needed during log in. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 15 What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The external 600TB and 1.2PB data storage servers are already available in our lab and hence no costs are incurred with their use. The use of the shared J -drive amounts to €51.90/100GB/year, which is covered by the laboratory. Additionally, data stored on the HPC costs €20/TB/year, which with the current capacity of 60TB costs €1200 which is covered by the host institution and the laboratory. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). Guidance on data preservation ☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on h umans ☐ Certain data cannot be ke pt for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data . Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide . ☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): Digital data (except cryo -EM data ) will be stored on the KU Leuven K: drive which is specifically meant for archive storage and has an unlimited ma ximum size. This drive can only be accessed by the researchers involved in the project and the data cannot be modified . The cryo -EM data (raw and metadata) will be compressed and stored on the external 600TB or 1.2PB server in the lab. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 16 What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The cost for the KU Leuven K: drive is €11.384/100GB/year, half of which is covered by the KU Leuven Group Biomedical Sciences , meaning the lab will have to pay €5.692/100GB/year. No costs are associated with the external 600TB or 1.2PB servers where the cryo -EM data will be stored. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available.
