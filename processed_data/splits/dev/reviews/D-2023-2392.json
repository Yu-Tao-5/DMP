  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "08/09/2023\r\nYour DMP contains most of the information asked by FWO but does follow their template, you can either use the new Flemish standard template that was introduced last year, you can find this DMPonline.be, or you can use the old FWO DMP template that you can find in the attachment, the content is good already so its mainly just copy pasting and adding some additional detail. Best to also add your physical data to the table, do you store and preserve these after the project? Also add the number(s) of your ethical approval. \nIf you have data that you like to share upon publication please have a look at EBI where you can find many good life sciences repositories and KU Leuven RDR, our institutional general repository: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ and https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr",
