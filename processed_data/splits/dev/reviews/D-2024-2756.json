  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "12/03/2024\r\n2 Data summary: you might consider to split the last row (protocols etc) in two rows, one for protocols and SOP’s and one for presentations and publications because they have a different relationship to the project.\n3 Documentation and metadata: you might provide some more detail about exactly which metadata will be kept in the xml-files.\n5 Data preservation after the project: \nYou mention the possibility of reusing SOP’s from earlier projects. That is a bit in contradiction with the answer “No” to the question about reuse of existing data in the data summary.\nIf you publish data alongside your publications, then there is a fair chance that the journal will ask to do so in a repository, either one suggested by the journal or one you are free to choose. You might say something about this if you think it is relevant.\n6 Data sharing\nI would add “or after approval” to “Institutional access only” in the second question because you mention the possibility of access on approval  in your answer to the first question.\nYou mention the possibility of intellectual property rights. In that case I would also mention this in your answer to the last question of the data summary. In the present version this is a bit inconsistent.\nA CC-BY license does not make much sense if the data will only be accessible upon approval. A specific data transfer agreement seems more appropriate.\r\n\r\n12/03/2024\r\n2 Data summary: you might consider to split the last row (protocols etc) in two rows, one for protocols and SOP’s and one for presentations and publications because they have a different relationship to the project.\n3 Documentation and metadata: you might provide some more detail about exactly which metadata will be kept in the xml-files.\n5 Data preservation after the project: \nYou mention the possibility of reusing SOP’s from earlier projects.
