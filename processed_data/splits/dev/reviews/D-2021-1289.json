Can you give an estimation of the total volume of data that you are collecting, this may help you to assess if you have sufficient storage space or need to contact ICTS to discuss which other solutions are available, if you only collect small datasets you can just give a maximum total volume. Have you considered whether you can store your data in open formats to facilitate preservation and sharing, or do you lose information in open formats and prefer using proprietary formats. \n4. Documentation and Metadata: please describe here how you document your work, for example via comments in code, using SOPs or (e)-notebooks, by adding readme files, using metadata generated with your measurements etc. \n7. Sharing: have you considered which repository to use already? If there is a disciplinary repository for your field that may be the best place to share and preserve your data, otherwise you can use KU Leuven RDR (www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr)",
