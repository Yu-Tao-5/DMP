In your answer to the question \"Where will the data be stored?\" you refer to \"As already indicated above\" but there is nothing to be found there. \n\nIn the form that is available to us the dmp really is too basic. I would suggest the following:\n- Best to always answer the questions, even if the answer is just \"No\" or \"Not relevant\".\n- It's common practice among mathematicians who only produce theorems, proofs and the like as data to refer in the data summary to the published articles containing the proofs. That is perfectly acceptable and makes it quite easy to answer many of the following questions in the template.\n- Documentation and metadata:\nDocumentation: you could refer to the information in the articles that should be sufficient as documentation for the readers.\nMetadata: you could refer to keywords and classification codes added to the articles. If the publisher expects you to use the Mathematics Classification Sheme you can refer to the MCS as a metadata standard used.\n- Where will data be stored?: You could refer to the manuscript copy on your pc before publication. Once the articles are published that becomes the new storage. The reference to arXiv is probably more something for \"sharing\".\n- Back up: no backup needed as soon as articles are published, before that probably on shared network drive backed up by ICTS.\n- On the questions about preservation and archiving you can refer to the published article, and to arXiv.\n- Expected costs: none or if you will publish in gold open access with an APC you could mention the APC as a cost.\n- For many of the questions under \"Data sharing and reuse\" you can refer to the published articles and arXiv.\n- Best to put names as answers to the question about responsibilities, even if it's always your own name.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMark Verbrugge\r\n\r\n20/03/2024\r\nDear Tom,\n\nI guess something went wrong when saving your dmp.
