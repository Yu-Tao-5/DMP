  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "12/06/2024\r\nYou already made a good start for your DMP but some sections need more attention. If you would like to discuss your DMP (or the feedback I provided) in a meeting, send me an email: ninotsjka.callens@kuleuven.be\n\n1) Research data summary:\n- Archival data = re-use existing data. Maybe estimate how big the physical volume will be.\n- Fieldwork data: In the application DMP you also mentioned photographing participants and recording them. Also include photographs, audio/video recordings, transcriptions here.\n- Privacy & ethics: Include your ethical approval reference number\n- Legal issues: since you re-use archival data, it will be important to consult the user agreements of the archival data as it may limit what you can do with the data.\n2) Documentation & Metadata: are crucial to make your data findable, understandable and reusable. It will be very important to organize and document your research project well, especially because you work with several types of data.\n- In the application DMP you mention organizing your data with a folder structure, clear file names and keywords. These are important efforts that need to be included here as well.\n- Other examples of relevant documentation include: a fieldwork logbook, documentation in the files of the interview transcripts and fieldnotes (e.g. information on interviewer or interviewee, location, weather, …), codebook documenting the meaning of the codes etc.\n- Reference managers like Zotero automatically retrieve metadata from sources. In Tropy you can easily add metadata to your research photos. https://docs.tropy.org/before-you-begin/metadata\n- “The doctoral researcher will use the Standard Repository for Metadata of the KULeuven” Do you mean depositing your research data in the KU Leuven Research Data Repository RDR and describing your data in the RDR metadata fields? See https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr\n\nFor more information: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/documentation-metadata\n\n3) Data storage during the research project:\n- How will you protect the personal data? OneDrive for business is suited for storing personal data if some additional measures are taken: 1) Multifactor authentication is enabled 2) the data are pseudonymized and 3) the data are encrypted. You can store the raw personal data and the pseudonymization key in a separate password protected internal location. For example on the I:drive (Personal network drive) or in a password protected folder on the J:Drive (Shared drive) of the research group. For more information consult the ICTS storage guide\n- Be careful with backing up data on external hard drives as the device can be lost or stolen, and the appropriate measures will need to be used in order to safeguard the data (such as encryption). The KU Leuven storage solutions have automated back-up procedures. For more info consult the ICTS storage guide above.\n- Where will you store the physical data and how will you organize it?\n\n4) Data preservation: According to KU Leuven’s RDM policy, relevant research data needs to be retained for a minimum of 10 years in a safe, secure, and sustainable way. Any requirements stipulated in third-party agreements overrule KU Leuven guidelines (for example the data transfer agreement with the RMCA). Your personal KU Leuven OneDrive for Business account and an external hard drive are not suited for archiving your data as they are not sustainable long term infrastructures. Final versions of datasets can be preserved for the long term in a trusted data repository or archive (for example KU Leuven RDR) or on internal KU Leuven data storage facilities that you can find in the ICTS Storage guide (for example an archival folder on the share drive of the research group). More information: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/preservation\n\n5) Consider depositing your newly generated datasets on the KU Leuven Research Data Repository RDR. The institutional repository helps KU Leuven researchers to publish, share, cite and preserve their data in a findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable way with support from KU Leuven staff. The data are safely preserved on KU Leuven servers, receive a DOI and are automatically linked with Lirias. It is also possible to put pseudonymized data in restricted access. See: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr\n\nMore information: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/data-sharing\n\n6) For PhD research projects, the PhD researchers will be responsible for day-to-day data management, whilst the supervisor will likely be responsible for overall data management, especially in the long term (for example data preservation and sharing).",
