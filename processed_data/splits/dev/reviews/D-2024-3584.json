  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "10/03/2025\r\nData Storage: OneDrive is no longer recommended for research data storage. Other internal KU Leuven solutions, such as the shared network drive of the research group, are preferable. Additional access restrictions should be applied to personal data. Also think of a good place to store the informed consent forms. If the shared drive cannot be used for active research data, please be aware of the personal nature of OneDrive. Once the researcher is no longer affiliated with KU Leuven, access to OneDrive will be lost. \nData Sharing: Will the pseudonymized/anonymized transcripts be shared in any form, and is this included in the Informed Consent? This is also important to consider for future publications that may arise from the research project.\nA DOI is automatically included when publishing data in the Research Data Repository (RDR)\nPlease update the DMP once PRET-review has been finalized.",
