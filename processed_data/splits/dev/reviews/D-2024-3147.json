If this is an error, please correct this when adding the ethical approval numbers and submit as intermediate DMP. \nStorage: your storage strategy looks complicated, can you store your data immediately on KU Leuven servers which make automatic backups? You can find information about KU Leuven solutions in the storage guide: https://icts.kuleuven.be/storagewijzer/en or contact your local IT team. Maybe ManGO could be interesting for you, see https://icts.kuleuven.be/sc/english/storage/mango or contact rdm-icts@kuleuven.be if you like to have more information. \nSharing: When you apply access restrictions on your data you cannot use a license but you will need a Data Transfer Agreement, the legal department and/or LRD will help you to draft this if needed. A persistent identifier will be added to your datasets when you deposit them in a data repository such as RDR. This identifier allows you to link your dataset in your publications and ensures that your dataset is findable.",
