Many severe cases of degradation are due to aggressive pitting corrosion of the reinforcing steel, caused by chloride\npenetration. As most research focuses either on chloride transport in concrete or on structural effects of rebar corrosion, an important\nresearch challenge lies in bridging these scales to advance our fundamental understanding of the interaction between the RC layout,\nchloride ingress, and corrosion damage. In this project, we will develop and experimentally validate multi-physics lattice discrete particle\nmodels (M-LDPM) that couple the mechanical analysis with reactive transport models, to study the spatial and temporal variability of the\ncorrosion process in relation to concrete heterogeneities. Advanced 4D visualization techniques are applied for validation of the M-LDPM\nsimulations. X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) is used to characterize the inner structure of small RC samples as input for sample-\nspecific M-LDPM, and 4D-XCT visualizes the kinetics of the corrosion process in space and time during natural corrosion tests. At the\nlarger scale, RC prisms are subjected to accelerated corrosion and monitored with 4D Acoustic Emission (AE) sensing. RC samples with\nvarious layouts are tested to validate M-LDPM that account for randomly distributed aggregates and discrete pre-existing mechanical\ncracks.\nID: \nID: \n212602\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-01-2025\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n31-12-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n18-02-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
