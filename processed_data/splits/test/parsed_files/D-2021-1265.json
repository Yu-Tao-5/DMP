Current\nrobotic systems still have several issues: they expose patients and surgeons to radiation, the\nreachable accuracy is limited as they do not update their path despite non-negligible patient\nmotion and motion between intervertebral segments due to drilling. To address these issues,\nHARMONY introduces a robot-assisted ultrasound(US) motion tracking system that allows online\nupdating of navigation paths improving PSP accuracy. A lightweight KUKA robot will be\nintegrated with an innovative hybrid ultrasound tracking mode. The developed system features\nautonomous force-controlled US imaging to reconstruct and track the spine during the\nintervention. Through the co-manipulated operation, the surgeon can take over control over US\nimaging if necessary. The developed prototype system will be verified in preclinical experiments.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
