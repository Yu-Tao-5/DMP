The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Mahoor MEHDIKHANI, https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3989-2678\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Yentl SWOLFS (https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7278-3022 ), supervisor\nProject number1 & title 12B0624N, Bone-inspired design of fiber-reinforced composites with optimal strength-toughness balance \n(BIOPTOUGH)\nFunder(s) GrantID2FWO (12B0624N)\nAffiliation(s) KU Leuven \nROR3 identifier: 05f950310\nPlease provide a short project description Carbon fiber composites are strong and lightweight but suffer from brittleness and low damage tolerance. \nThis hinders realizing their full sustainability potential. Nature can provide inspiration as there are many \nstrong natural materials with a high damage tolerance. Bone is a good example. Next to its superb \nstrength-toughness balance, bone has other unique features that can inspire the design of new materials \nwith much higher performance and durability. They include superb properties with not-excellent \nconstituents, hierarchical toughening mechanisms, efficient structure, and self-healing. Attempts so far \nfailed to mimic all these features. Therefore, BIOPTOUGH aims to design and produce a carbon fiber-\nreinforced composite that incorporates the main engineering features of bone. It first employs cutting-\nedge image acquisition and processing tools for in-situ analysis of bone mechanics. Based on this \nknowledge and deep learning, finite element models are created to optimize the strength-toughness \nbalance of bone-inspired composites. The optimized designs are realized using advanced manufacturing \ntechniques such as 3D printing. Finally, the produced bone-inspired materials are tested with in-situ 3D \nimaging to verify the envisioned toughening mechanism. As the main result, BIOPTOUGH creates a bone-\ninspired composite, yielding a great strength-toughness balance, smart architecture, self-healing, and \nmore efficient use of the constituents via its hierarchical optimized design.\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number. This question is optional since not every institution has an internal project number different from the GrantID. Applicants can \nonly provide one project number.  2 Funder(s) GrantID refers to the number of the DMP at the funder(s), here one can specify multiple GrantIDs if multiple funding sources were used.3 Research Organization Registry Community. https://ror.org/\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 32.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7Our data is not highly sensitive. Anyway, access to our NAS is limited to a few people in the group. The selected data on OneDrive is only accessible by me. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Since we do not see any need for extra storage at the moment, we do not anticipate any costs. Just, 1-2 external HDDs will be purchased, which are inexpensive and can be purchased from the project bench fee. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 85. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).The selected data, which was stored also on OneDrive, will be retained for 5 years after the end of the project. This will include all the optical images and CT volumes of critical loading steps. If the fellow (Mahoor Mehdikhani) leaves KUL before the end of the retention period, the responsibility will be transferred to the PI, i.e. Prof. Yentl Swolfs. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?On the NAS and the external HDDs. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Since the selected data will be stored locally on two different storages, there is no costs associated with it. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 96. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☐ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.In an Open Access repository I have already stored three datasets, similar to what I will create in BIOPTOUGH, on Mendeley Data, for which I have also published three data articles in Data in Brief Journal. I will do the same (storing on Mendeley Data and publishing data articles) for the current project. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.Upon publication of the research results I will try to make the data publicly available during the project along with publication of the results. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 Both Mendeley Data and Data in Brief article are open access. Therefore, the data will be accessible for public. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes ☐ No If yes: What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Mendeley Data provides 10 GB of free space, which I believe is enough for the selected data for public access. Data in Brief publication has a cost of 700 USD, which will be paid from the project bench fee. 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 117.
