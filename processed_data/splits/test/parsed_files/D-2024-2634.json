It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis sc ripts and code. Physical data are all materials that need proper management because they are valuable, difficult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentation/metadata. RDM Guidance on data If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type . Global Human Settlement Layer: https://human -settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/download.php WorldPop: https://www.worldpop.org/ VIIRS night -time lights of Earth Observation Group: https://eogdata.mines.edu/products/vnl/#v1 Are there any ethical issues conc erning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)?

If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes , please comment : Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements , research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Are there any other legal issues, su ch as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3. Documentation and Metadata FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9 Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata . • Analysis and/or calculations on existing data sets will be conducted in the R programming language. All code will be provided by extensive documentation. I will employ computational notebooks, such as Quarto for this purpose. These notebooks allow to combine both text, code and figures in a clear and organised manner. The notebooks with documentation of the workflow will be openly made available in a code repository according to the FAIR principle (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) to ensure reproducibility. • When creati ng new data (such as the urban delineations), there will always be an accompanying JSON -file generated with the metadata (see below). Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata sta ndard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : • Metadata about the urban/sprawl delineations generated in WP1, WP2 and WP3 will be stored in JSON files. The JSON -files will contain the source data and parameters/configurations used to generate the delineation and the timestamp of creation. 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10 Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data. ☐ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I -drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on -premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☒ Other: • All code will be stored using Git version control (through KU Leuven GitLab service). • Data and metadata will be stored on the active data management platform (ManGO) and on a server environment provided by the research group of the co -supervisor (Ate Poor thuis) How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? ☒ Standard back -up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back -ups I make (specify) ☒ Other (specify) : • Git version control will be used to store the code repositories. The Git service includes online back - ups. • The data and metadata will be stored both on OneDrive , on a server environment provided by the research group of the co -supervisor (Ate Poorthuis) and on KU Leuven’s ManGO facility. This three - double storage ensures back -up of the data and metadata. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No • The expected size of all research datasets is between 100GB and 200GB. OneDrive for Business Cloud storage allows for a maximum size of 2 TB. KU Leuven’s ManGO facility allows for data storage up to 1 TB. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11 How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . Guidance on security for research data • Both OneDrive and ManGO is only accessible through the KU Leuven multifactor authentication procedure. Editing an d viewing rights in OneDrive can be set within KU Leuven. As a default, the datasets will be made inaccessible to those not involved with the research project. ManGO projects are only accessible to project members by definition. Both data storage solutions are thus highly secured. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? • There are no expected costs. Both the OneDrive and ManGO facility are free for the expected size of the res earch project. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .).
