In the absence of their parents, role of supervisors in digital lives of unaccompanied minor refugees is significant. The aim of this\nqualitative study is to explore firstly, how unaccompanied minors interact with social media to access information and how they cope with\nvulnerabilities to online misinformation and fake news; secondly, to examine the role of supervisors and school teachers in their digital lives in the\nabsence of parents; and, thirdly to investigate various characteristics that unaccompanied minors manifest in this digital landscape. I will use\npreexisting qualitative data and conduct secondary analyses on interview material previously collected as part of the ySKILLS project in which using\nconvenient sampling method, thirty-five (35) interviews with young refugees aged 13-18 were conducted in Belgium during 2021-2022. Interview\ntranscripts will be analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings will be of significant value for formulating policy recommendations and policy\nadvices in an European context.\nIt is worth noting that this project is a preliminary step before conducting my Marie Curie fellowship project.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n18-01-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
