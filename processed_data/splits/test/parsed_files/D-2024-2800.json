Additionally, product quality\nperception is negatively impacted by tonal noises generated in machinery and vehicles, which are often variable in frequency. While the applicability\nof traditional noise and vibration mitigation solutions has significantly reduced due to a lightweight product design trend observed in industry,\npiezoelectric locally resonant metamaterials (PLRMs) have shown great potential to provide lightweight, effective and adaptive noise and vibration\nmitigation. At present, PLRMs are limited to ad-hoc realizations for academic validation and predicting their vibroacoustic performance remains a\nchallenge due to their multi-physical and complex nature. This PhD proposal aims to overcome these challenges by designing and realizing integrated\nPLRM structures, efficiently manufactured with insert injection moulding. To achieve this, manufacturing strategies, together with a novel multi-\nphysical model that considers manufacturing influences, will be developed to explore, compare and realize performant insert injection moulded PLRM\nconcepts. Through demonstrations of industrial complexity, PLRMs will be shown to provide lightweight, effective, and adaptive noise and vibration\nmitigation for variable noise sources in order to further reduce the gap to industrial exploitation. \nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n15-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Last modiﬁed 15 April 2024 3 of 7 for both the (multi-physical) vibro-acoustic finite element and injection moulding process simulations, a readme file will describe simulation input parameters, definitions and software settings used to construct the excising models. Additional modelling assumptions will be added together with a validity range of the model where needed. This information is kept in the CAE file format or in an accompanying text file.

If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. make the data easier to find and reuse. No Although these are not formalized, state-of-practice standards will be used regarding metadata. On the one hand, standardized CAE file format information and structure are used. On the other hand, when working with transferable neutral text formats for experimental and simulation data, common engineering practice is used, deploying tabulated structures with clear column and row headers. A clear folder structure will be adopted for the data storage, in accordance with the different tasks carried out during the project. In every (sub)directory, a readme file will list all the present subdirectories and files as well as where the data is used and stored. Whenever publication or sharing of a dataset would be considered, it will be re-evaluated if an applicable metadata standard is available and can be applied to enhance sharing. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Physical samples (hardware) will be stored in dedicated lab storage of the KU Leuven Division LMSD. Data will be stored using cloud- and ICTS-based solutions: Local desktop file storage, with automatic backups on the researcher’s personal KU Leuven network drive. Cloud-based storage, synchronized with local desktop storage: KU Leuven OneDrive and Microsoft Teams, which provide version control. GitLab repository of the KU Leuven Division LMSD for collaborative research code. For specific storage solutions, there is support from ICTS as well as local IT from the KU Leuven science, engineering and technology group. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? The cloud-based and ICTS storage solutions are backed-up as part of the offered services. Back-ups are provided on different levels: For the data stored on the KU Leuven central servers, automatic daily back-up procedures apply. KU Leuven OneDrive and GitLab provide automated backups. Backups from local desktop file storage to personal KU Leuven network drive will automatically be performed (e.g. using SyncBackFree backup software). Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Currently sufficient storage & backup capacity is available during the project for the anticipated data volumes. The available storage space and file size limits exceed the currently estimated required storage space. Furthermore, network drive and cloud storage space can be readily expanded upon request to KU Leuven IT services. Created using DMPonline.be.

How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? On the one hand, in this project no sensitive personal data will be used. On the other hand, both cloud and ICTS based storage solutions are only accessible via proper credentials which are centrally managed. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? In case expenses are needed, part of the allocated FWO project budget can be used. However, this is currently not expected. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). institutional policies...). The physical samples and demonstrators will be stored in the KU Leuven Division LMSD’s lab storage. In case space limitations would require keeping only a selection of the manufactured samples, a selection will be based on which samples are more easily & low cost reproducible versus which samples are not as well as the required storage space, while prioritizing on the preservation of the demonstrators which have high valorisation and outreach potential. Particular focus for non-hardware data preservation will be on: Data at the basis of publications such as journal papers, conference papers and presentations or posters. All data related to Open Access publications will be retained on repositories (like RDR, Zenodo or Lirias). Developed models and measurement datasets which are likely to be reused in the research unit for future research and/or valorisation activities and for future research of the researcher. Potentially large (intermediate and non-postprocessed raw) result and measurement files will be discarded to reduce required storage space if the simulation models and experiments allow to recalculate/remeasure the results easily and at low cost and time. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Hardware storage will be done in the foreseen storage space in the KU Leuven Division LMSD’s labs. Data will be archived on internal KU Leuven data storage facilities. The data will be stored on the university's central servers on a data archive drive (with automatic back-up procedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. In addition, measurement data can be published in data papers describing and promoting the dataset. Published manuscript preprints will be stored on the KU Leuven Open Access repository Lirias. All other long term stored data will be on KU Leuven ICTS servers. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Expected costs for storage beyond project duration will be limited and covered by the research group. 5. Data sharing and reuse 5.
