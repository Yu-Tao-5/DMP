The metadata can be exported as a .csv file.\nFor the interview documentation, the questions/topics list, consent forms and information letters will be provided as .pdf files. As\nfor the documentation that will contain the key characteristics of the interview participants and the interview date, time and\nlocation, they will be stored on a secure, password-protected .odt and/or .ods files by each researcher separately. This personal\nidentifying material will not be accessible to any other member of the research team. In terms of the archival material, specifically\nthe educational textbooks, a record will be kept in a separate bibliographic database, with relevant codes related to extracts of\nthe material, with metadata according to the DataCite standard, including the origin of the text, the type of file, its time of creation\nand creator, as well as other standard metadata for written archival material (mandatory, recommended and additionally\nlanguage and format from the optional metadata categories). \nFor general file management, OneDrive for Business will be used in an orderly fashion. The files are structured from higher level\nbroader topics to more specific folders within them. Files will be named according to a convention which requires the name to\ncontain the type of file, its creator, its time of creation. Access to this data will be available only to members of the project, (i.e. the\nPhD researchers and the promoter/co-promoters). \nFor the analysed interview data, a codebook.tsv and readme.txt will be provided.

The metadata categories include the 12 mandatory and recommended metadata categories for DataCite version 4.6\n(released Dec 6th 2024), with the remainder optional. In the case of written archival material and/or textbooks, the language and\nformat optional metadata categories will also be included.\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 15 January 2025\n5 of 9\nThe project will follow best practice in structural (outline) metadata for the datasets, and will adhere to KU Leuven guidelines on\nthe provision and organisation of such structural metadata elements.\nData Storage & Back-up during the Research Project\nData Storage & Back-up during the Research Project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nWhere will the data be stored?\nSharepoint online\nOneDrive (KU Leuven)\nAll the data that do not contain any personal or private information of the researcher and the participants (i.e., journal articles,\ndesk research notes, interview questions, information letters, publication materials and interview analyses) will be stored in the\nresearchers' Sharepoint drive through MS Teams. In this context, additional protocols will be added to protect the data in\naccordance with rules around third country and non-European data storage:\n(see \nhttps://icts.kuleuven.be/sc/english/storage/extra_measures/\n).\nThe data that may contain personal and private information, notably pseudonymised transcripts which remain a form of personal\ndata, will be stored in a secure KU Leuven managed storage, specifically the researchers' OneDrive, with access only to the\nindividual PANIC project participants.  \nData storage of direct personal information (names, personal identifiers and email addresses of interviewees, for example) will\nbe stored on a separate computer in a password protected odt or ods file accesible only to each researcher individually (as\noutlined in the relevant SMEC applications).\nHow will the data be backed up?\nHow will the data be backed up?\nStandard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution\nBackup data will be created in line with the KU Leuven standard back up storage offering from KU Leuven ICTS. This includes\nhourly, daily and weekly backups of data as outlined on \nICTS Storage Guidance\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? \nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, explain how this will be taken care of. \nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, explain how this will be taken care of. \nYes\nThere is no expectation of the data exceeding 1 TB in total for all project data; as such, a standard KU Leuven backup is\nappropriate, as described above. Should very large quantities of data need to be stored, additional large storage facilities will be\nrequested from KU Leuven (a K or L drive), which, like the standard backup, will be paid for out of project funds.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? \nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? \nOnly the individual PhD researchers (not the supervisors) have access to the files that contain non-pseudonymised personal data,\nwhich will be stored separately in files on Bitlocker protected computer drives. In doing so, no crossover access between\npseudonymised and original personal data will be possible, except by the individual researchers in each case. Hard copies of any\ndata (consent forms) will be locked in cupboards in the offices of PANIC project promoters/co-promoters. The pseudonymisation\nkeys will be kept separate from the pseudonymised data, and these keys will be in password protected MS Word/Open Office\ndocuments that are accessible only to the individual researcher concerned.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nThe expected cost of storing the data on OneDrives is negligible, with no specific costs forseen at this stage. In the unlikely event\nthat large scale storage becomes necessary (this will involve KU Leuven K or L drive storage), the current cost is 95.14 EUR per\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

How will these costs be covered?\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nThe cost of data archiving will depend on the scale of the data. Since each researcher has 50GB of free storage space in the KU\nLeuven RDR archives, it seems likely that this will be sufficient for the data output of the project, including any added metadata. In\nterms of potential large scale data, such as videos, only screenshots and fragments will be stored, meaning that the overall\nvolume of data should stay within the 50GB per person limit. In any case, additional storage costs, should they arise, will be\ncovered by project funds.\nData Sharing and Reuse\nData Sharing and Reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  \nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  \nPlease explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available.\nPlease explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available.\nYes, as open data\nYes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only)\nAll research data except for the informed consent forms, interview preparations, and transcripts will be made available for open\naccess through KU Leuven's RDR. Pseudonymised data and any potential personal or identifying data (which may remain even\nafter pseudonymisation).will only be shared as restricted data, with a request to the researcher/promoter required.

All the published data (journal, books, reports, theses, and so on.) and their metadata are documented and stored via Zotero and its built-in storage. The metadata can be exported as a .csv file. For the interview documentation, the questions/topics list, consent forms and information letters will be provided as .pdf files. As for the documentation that will contain the key characteristics of the interview participants and the interview date, time and location, they will be stored on a secure, password-protected .odt and/or .ods files by each researcher separately. This personal identifying material will not be accessible to any other member of the research team. In terms of the archival material, specifically the educational textbooks, a record will be kept in a separate bibliographic database, with relevant codes related to extracts of the material, with metadata according to the DataCite standard, including the origin of the text, the type of file, its time of creation and creator, as well as other standard metadata for written archival material (mandatory, recommended and additionally language and format from the optional metadata categories). For general file management, OneDrive for Business will be used in an orderly fashion. The files are structured from higher level broader topics to more specific folders within them. Files will be named according to a convention which requires the name to contain the type of file, its creator, its time of creation. Access to this data will be available only to members of the project, (i.e. the PhD researchers and the promoter/co-promoters).

Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Sharepoint online OneDrive (KU Leuven) All the data that do not contain any personal or private information of the researcher and the participants (i.e., journal articles, desk research notes, interview questions, information letters, publication materials and interview analyses) will be stored in the researchers' Sharepoint drive through MS Teams. In this context, additional protocols will be added to protect the data in accordance with rules around third country and non-European data storage: (see https://icts.kuleuven.be/sc/english/storage/extra_measures/ ). The data that may contain personal and private information, notably pseudonymised transcripts which remain a form of personal data, will be stored in a secure KU Leuven managed storage, specifically the researchers' OneDrive, with access only to the individual PANIC project participants. Data storage of direct personal information (names, personal identifiers and email addresses of interviewees, for example) will be stored on a separate computer in a password protected odt or ods file accesible only to each researcher individually (as outlined in the relevant SMEC applications). How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up?

Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, explain how this will be taken care of. Yes There is no expectation of the data exceeding 1 TB in total for all project data; as such, a standard KU Leuven backup is appropriate, as described above. Should very large quantities of data need to be stored, additional large storage facilities will be requested from KU Leuven (a K or L drive), which, like the standard backup, will be paid for out of project funds. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Only the individual PhD researchers (not the supervisors) have access to the files that contain non-pseudonymised personal data, which will be stored separately in files on Bitlocker protected computer drives. In doing so, no crossover access between pseudonymised and original personal data will be possible, except by the individual researchers in each case. Hard copies of any data (consent forms) will be locked in cupboards in the offices of PANIC project promoters/co-promoters. The pseudonymisation keys will be kept separate from the pseudonymised data, and these keys will be in password protected MS Word/Open Office documents that are accessible only to the individual researcher concerned.

What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The cost of data archiving will depend on the scale of the data. Since each researcher has 50GB of free storage space in the KU Leuven RDR archives, it seems likely that this will be sufficient for the data output of the project, including any added metadata. In terms of potential large scale data, such as videos, only screenshots and fragments will be stored, meaning that the overall volume of data should stay within the 50GB per person limit. In any case, additional storage costs, should they arise, will be covered by project funds.
