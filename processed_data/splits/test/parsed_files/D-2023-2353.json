If so, please\ncomment per dataset or data type where appropriate. \nNo\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material or Data transfer agreements, Research\ncollaboration agreements)? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.\nNo\nAre there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please\nexplain in the comment section to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.\nNo\nDocumentation and Metadata\nClearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep \ndata understandable and usable\n, for\nyourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks,\nREADME.txt files, codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). \nFirst, the post-doctoral researcher in charge of day-to-day study coordination will create a subfile '1. Onderzoeksopzet' within the overarching file containing all\ninformation and documentation on the study. In this '1. Onderzoeksopzet' file, detailed information on the study design will be kept and regularly updated through\ndetailed notes and reports of meetings and exchanges between the research team and changes/updates to the design that might result from these. In addition, thorough\nrecords of all exchanges taking place between members of the research team, or between the research team and outside parties as part of the study, will be kept in a\nseparate folder: '2. Bijeenkomsten en overleg'. \nSecond, every dataset will be accompanied by a separate README.txt file, saved and accessible at the same location as the dataset. This file will contain both contextual\ninformation on the data (when, how, where, by whom, and with whom it was collected) as well as technical information on the ways in which data were processed (e.g.,\nmeans of data input, data software used, manipulations of the data, process of analyses) and technical details on how to access and process the data in the future.  \nEach quantitative dataset will furthermore be accompanied by a codebook (excel spreadsheet) providing an overview of all variables in each dataset, their values, and\ncorresponding meanings. \nAfter completion of the analysis, each qualitative dataset will be accompanied by a coding tree (.pdf) detailing the outcome of the qualitative analyses. \nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to \nfind and reuse the data\n?  \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. \nIf not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. \nNo\nData Storage & Back-up during the Research Project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nOneDrive (KU Leuven)\nHow will the data be backed up?\nStandard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? \nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, explain how this will be taken care of. \nYes\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 12 December 2023\n3 of 5\nWe expect that the storage of the data will not exceed the storage space provided by One Drive, KU Leuven. \nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? \nAll digital data will be kept on the One Drive KU Leuven server, protected by two-factor identification needed from all KU Leuven researchers. After assessment on paper\nin schools or in family homes, pseudonymized data are promptly digitalized and uploaded immediately from researchers' computers to these secured network drives.\nDuring the project, data storage and organization are managed by Caroline Spaas, the post-doctoral researcher responsible for day-to-day coordination of the project. \nOn the server, all data are pseudonymized by allocating a unique code to each participant that allows for the connection of different types of data per participant. After\npseudonymization, a document matching the codes and participants will be stored separately on One Drive and will be accessible only by Caroline Spaas, the post-\ndoctoral researcher responsible for day-to-day coordination of the project, and Lucia De Haene, the study lead. \nOne Drive folders and documents will only be shared with researchers involved in the study. When needed, sharing of data and/or documents with others will occur only\nwith restricted access (through e-mail) and editing rights (read-only). \nAll physical data (paper questionnaires) will be kept in a locked cabinet in the office of Caroline Spaas, the post-doctoral researcher responsible for day-to-day coordination\nof the project. Field notes by researchers made in physical notebooks will be kept anonymous to ensure the privacy of study participants and avoid potential identification\nof study participants through these field notes. \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nWe expect that the storage of the data will not exceed the storage space provided by One Drive, KU Leuven. Thus, we do not anticipate any additional costs for data\nstorage for this project. \nData Preservation after the end of the Research Project\nWhich data will be retained for 10 years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? \nIn case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional\npolicies...).\nAll data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? \nOther (specify below)\nOne Drive KU Leuven - Archive\nResponsible: prof. dr.

How will these costs be covered?\nData storage is not expected to exceed the possibilities provided by the standard KU Leuven storage solutions and thus will not involve additional costs. \nData Sharing and Reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  \nPlease explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available.\nYes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only)\nFor the duration of the project, the data will be shared by the promotors and co-promotors of the study, the two PhD students working on the study, Caroline Spaas (post-\ndoctoral researcher), and the migrant co-researchers working on the project. For migrant co-researchers needing access to the data, specific contracts will be drawn up\ndocumenting project privacy agreements and ensuring their secured access to One Drive KU Leuven. As such, for all members of the research team, access to the data\nwill always be by two-factor identification to gain access to the data stored on the One Drive KU Leuven server. \nAfter completion of the project, the data will not be made openly available nor available under embargo as data concerns potentially sensitive materials collected with a\nsocially vulnerable group of participants (refugee and migrant families). Data might be shared upon agreement with third parties. Data-sharing policy agreements will then\nbe drawn up between the study team and parties requesting access to the data. \nScientific publications resulting from the project will be stored in the KU Leuven repository LIRIAS. \nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. \nFor the duration of the project, the data will be shared by the promotors and co-promotors of the study, the two PhD students working on the study, Caroline Spaas (post-\ndoctoral researcher), and the migrant co-researchers working on the project.
