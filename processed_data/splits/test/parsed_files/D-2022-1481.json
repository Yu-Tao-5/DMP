Recent literature has shown that part of\nthese gaps start after the birth of the first child, with large effects on short and long run\nemployment and earnings of women. While some of this motherhood effect can be explained by\nintrahousehold labor supply decisions, less is known how firms respond to maternity leave. In the\nshort run, firms may have to adapt their workload across workers and increase labor demand. In\naddition, in contexts with high labor market informality (as is the case in most developing and\ntransition economies), firms could also use unregistered workers and underreported hours of\nwork as margins of response. In the medium run, firms could update their expectations and\npotentially adapt their hiring practices to avoid these costs, which could harm womenâ€™s\nemployment opportunities. This project aims to study the impact of childbearing on the labor\nmarket, both from the point of view of workers and firms, in the presence of labor market\ninformality. It leverages detailed linked employer-employee administrative data, household\nsurveys and a project-specific manager survey from Uruguay. We use dynamic difference-in-\ndifferences research designs to take advantage of the different timing of births across individuals\nand firms, to study how the trajectories of worker and firm level outcomes are shifted after\nexperiencing a maternity leave.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

These datasets will be used for descriptive and econometric analysis using\nStata (.dta), generating tables and graphs with descriptive statistics and model parameter\nestimates. \n3. Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nYes\nFirst, we use two confidential datasets obtained from Uruguay's social security administration\n(Banco de Previsión Social--BPS). These are monthly records from 1996 to 2016 for (a) a sample\nof workers and (b) a sample of firms. The datasets are anonymized by BPS before giving them to\nus to protect the confidentiality of the records.  Second, we use publicly available household\nsurvey data, which is already anonymized and published by Uruguay's statistics office (Instituto\nNacional de Estadística).  In both of these cases, we do not use personal data because we receive\nthe data anonymized and the information does not allow one to identify a person.\nThird, we plan for a survey of firms to collect information on informal employment practices in\nUruguay. We will contract a local survey company with the experience and resources to collect\nsuch data according to the highest standards. We will gather basic demographic information\nabout the respondent, information about managenerial practices and information about the firm.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 5\nWe will anonymize or pseudonimize the data or request the contracted local survey firm to\nanonymize it for us. \nPRET application: G-2022-5456 (in process of elaboration, to be submitted during year 1 of the\nproject)\n \n \nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nNo\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nYes\nWe use two confidential datasets obtained from Uruguay's social security administration (Banco\nde Previsión Social--BPS). These are monthly records from 1996 to 2016 for (a) a sample of\nworkers and (b) a sample of firms. We have access to the data under a data use agreement with\nBPS. The agreement prevents us from sharing the data with third parties. \n \n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nAt the end of the project, we will create a document detailing the sources of data used and\ninstructions on how to obtain the data, including how to apply for the use of confidential data. We\nwill also make available all the code we use to process the data and for the statistical and\neconometric analysis. The detailed code will enable any researcher with access to the original\ndataset to replicate our analysis.\nIn the case of our own survey, we will make the anonymized dataset available to other\nresearchers by request. The information on how to request this data will be included in the data\ndocumentation, as well as in my professional webpage. We will create a sharable dataset,\ntogether with a data dictionary and descriptive 'read me' document. \nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nWe will carefully document the data creation, management, and statistical and econometric\nanalysis.\nFor the creation of the documents, and for creating the metadata of our survey of managers, we\nwill use the standards of the leading Economics journals to allow any researcher with access to\nthe original dataset to replicate our analysis. To make our survey data available, we will use the\ndata repository and standards used by the journal(s) where our research is published. If the\njournal(s) does not have a repository, we will use a repository used by one of the leading journals\nin Economics. \n \n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nThe master copy of the data will be kept on my personal computer and backed up in Dropbox.\nCopies can be made and kept on personal devices. Since I will collaborate with two coauthors,\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 5\ncopies can be make and kept on our personal devices, and we will use Dropbox for active use,\ncollaboration and real time back-up of the data during the project.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe original data will be stored in the PI's personal computer with back up on\nDropbox. Intermediate analysis datasets will by kept in the PI's computer and the computers\nof her collaborators, with automatic real-time back up on Dropbox. \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nYes, there is currently sufficient storage and backup capacity in both my server at KU Leuven and\nmy Dropbox account where the back-ups will be made. The funds in the project allow for\nmaintenance of the servers, purchasing a computer for a student assistant, and purchasing more\nstorage and back-up capacity if needed.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nFor IT-material, we foresee 2* 2.500€ for powerful computers for the principal investigator and\nthe research assistant to work on, including software (incl Stata licenses, purchase of credits for\nthe use of KU Leuven servers, Dropbox extended storage and version history subscription).\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nSince we will be working with confidential datasets (although all data will be anonymized before\nwe obtain it), we will take security measures by keeping the data only in password protected\npersonal use devices and using password protected cloud back up through a reputable service\n(Dropbox). Servers and PCs are managed by ICT department of FEB, according to latest security\nnorms. Data sets can only be accessed by researchers who obtained permission.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nIn line with KU Leuven policy, the original raw data files will be preserved for at least 10 years. In\naddition to these source datasets, the project will create processed data files, i.e. intermediate\ncustomized datasets that contain combinations of existing datasets but also models generated\nas part of the project. These datasets will be used for descriptive and econometric analysis using\nStata (.dta), generating tables and graphs with descriptive statistics and model parameter\nestimates, and will not be preserved after the project. Instead, the code that creates these\ndatasets and all project output from the original raw data, as well as any other data processing,\nwill be stored and publicly available.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nThe data at KU Leuven will remain stored for 10 years under the custody of the principal\ninvestigator, under her own service and online backup services.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nBecause of the size and the current capacity of the servers, the marginal costs of preserving the\ndata are small. The strategy of keeping the data in different forms (hard disks drives and online\nbackup services) guarantees the preservation of the data at a cost of up to 5000 euro under the\nbudget of the project.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nYes. Specify:\nWe use two confidential datasets obtained from Uruguay's social security administration (Banco\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 5\nde Previsión Social--BPS). These are monthly records from 1996 to 2016 for (a) a sample of\nworkers and (b) a sample of firms. We have access to the data under a data use agreement with\nBPS, which prevents us from sharing the data with third parties. \nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nWe will make available the data documentation, including instructions on how to request the\nproprietary data and how to obtain the public use household survey data, and the code we use to\nprocess the data and obtain the project's research output. \nWe will also make the data from our project's survey available to other researchers upon\nrequest. \nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn an Open Access repository\nIn a restricted access repository\nTo make all data documentation and code available, we will use the data repository and\nstandards used by the journal(s) where our research is published. If the journal(s) does not have\na repository, we will use a repository used by one of the leading journals in Economics. We will\nmake our survey data available upon request through a restricted access repository. The\nprocedure for requesting access to data will be available on the principal investigator's website.\n \nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nAny interested party will be able to request access to our survey data. Access will be considered\nafter a request is submitted explaining the planned reuse. Only uses for research purposes will\nbe allowed and commercial reuse will be excluded.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nThere is no additional cost of data sharing our data documentation and our own survey data,\nbesides the time of the researchers and the data storage costs already mentioned above. \n8.
