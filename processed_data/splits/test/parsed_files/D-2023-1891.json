Even in Egypt, where the dry desert has\ncreated exceptional preservation conditions for organic materials, very few of these surviving textiles have been studied in detail. In the\nlast few decades Egyptian textiles have seen some increase in interest. There is however much that remains unknown, especially\nregarding textiles from the Old- to Middle Kingdom (OK-MK, 2686-1650 BCE). This gap in our knowledge cannot be explained by a lack\nof evidence, since there are many large pieces of fabric from this period preserved in museums. Moreover, this period has produced a\nnumber of iconographical depictions of textile workshops. These models and paintings form the base of our current knowledge of ancient\nEgyptian textile production, and have been generally interpreted through the lens of West-European production methods. Yet the extant\nmaterial reveals that the production process would have looked completely different in Egypt.\nThis project aims to reconstruct the chaîne opératoire by comparing the attributes of the physical textiles with the iconographic evidence.\nThe study comprises collections of OK-MK textiles housed in museums, complemented by data from recently excavated material found in\ndated contexts. By combining this data with iconography and experimental archaeology, I expect to gain significant new insights into an\nunderstudied period of textile history.\nLast modified: \n02-04-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Last modiﬁed 02 April 2023\n2 of 5\nNo\nAre there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain in the comment section to\nwhat data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.\nNo\n2. Documentation and Metadata\nClearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in\nthe future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is\nrecorded).\n1) Bibliographic references are organised in Zotero, in different folders per subject, and with tags for chronology, geography, actions etc. They are linked to the digital files.\n2) The pictures, metadata and annotations are stored in structured folders on my drive. A readme file makes this structure accessible to others when I deposit it in the RDR. During my project this\ndata will be compiled in an annotated catalogue per object/depiction, which I intend to publish in some form.\n3) The textile analysis data (measurements, drawings, pictures, microscopy images and metadata) is stored in folders structured per site/museum. I will include a document with an overview of the\nsites and contexts studied in the main folder, along with the key to museum abbreviations. All textiles have an individual object number to identify them, which is also used in the microscopy\nimages. The observations and measurements that are collected in Excel and Filemaker will be exported to a .csv format before sharing them on the RDR.\n4) The observations and pictures from the textile experiments will also be stored together in structured folders, together with the written reports to make them accessible.\n \nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be\nused. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nThere is no metadata standard for my particular field. I am however not the first one to work with archaeological textiles, and thus my database format is inspired by that of other textile\narchaeologists, and adapted to make it work for my particular material and research questions. As such it is compatible and comparable with databases of other scientists in my field.\n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nAll my data will be stored on my KU Leuven OneDrive, since I am the only one working on this research project. The KUL offers 2TB, with the possibility of further expansion if needed.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nBy storing my data on my KU Leuven OneDrive, I will keep it safe and accessible from multiple devices. Data that is generated on my laptop's hard drive, like microscopy images, are saved to my\nOneDrive daily. Images taken on other devices are also regularly saved to the OneDrive. During fieldwork in Egypt, I make sure to regularly get internet, so my OneDrive synchronises.\nPhysical notes and sketches/drawings are photographed before travelling, and properly digitised using afterwards.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nYes, the 2TB of free OneDrive storage should be enough for the data in my project.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nThe KU Leuven OneDrive accounts are managed by KU Leuven ICTS. They are protected by multi-factor authentication. My research project does not involve personal, sensitive or protected\ndata, so OneDrive offers me enough security. Microsoft encrypts its data and data transfers, for further information see https://icts.kuleuven.be/sc/english/storage/onedrive.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nThe KU Leuven OneDrive is offered for free, there are no costs involved.\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be\npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\nMy newly generated data (point 2, 3 and 4 above) will be stored for at least 10 years after the end of the research project. There are no foreseeable restrictions on the data.\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 02 April 2023\n3 of 5\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nThe data and metadata will be stored on the KU Leuven newly launched Research Data Repository (RDR). \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nThe KUL RDR provides 50GB free storage per year, which should be enough for my dataset(s).\n5. Data sharing and reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made\navailable.\nYes, in an Open Access repository\n1) The assembled literature will not be made available for reuse, because of copyright. I can however share a file upon personal request.\n2) The iconographic data will be made available Open Access, perhaps in a published catalogue form. I am still discussing options for publication.\n3) The data collected from the physical textiles will be available after the end of my project, and publication of the analysis. The measurements, metadata and pictures will be available on the\nRDR.\n4) The documentation of the experiments will also be included in my reposited datasets. I intend to publish the results in an OA article.\nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.\nI do not see any reason why access to my data should be restricted. Some images and drawings from other publications could still be under copyright, but when properly attributed this should not\nform an issue.\nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment\nsection per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nNo\nWhere will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.\nAll will be made available on the KU Leuven Research Data Repository (https://rdr.kuleuven.be/).\nWhen will the data be made available?\nAfter the end of the project and upon publication of the results of the research project.\nWhich data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why.\nThe data will be published under a CC-BY license. This means that it is freely reusable with attribution.\nDo you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section.\nYes\nI do intend to do so once it is uploaded.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nI do not expect any costs from data sharing.\n6. Responsibilities\nWho will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project?\nI will manage all data and metadata. \nWho will manage data storage and backup during the research project?\nI will manage all storage and backup. \nWho will manage data preservation and sharing?\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 02 April 2023\n4 of 5\nI will manage data preservation and sharing, with the approval of my supervisor. \nWho will update and implement this DMP?\nI am responsible to update and implement this DMP. \nCreated using DMPonline.be.
