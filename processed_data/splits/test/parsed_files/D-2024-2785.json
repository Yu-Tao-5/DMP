Current synthesis routes face limitations, e.g. because of changing feedstocks or\nhigh energy demand. We here propose to couple olefins like ethylene directly to one another, with\nnet removal of 2 H-atoms. The proposal is based on the applicant’s finding that Pd, in combination\nwith a hydroxypyridine ligand, can couple olefins to dienes with oxygen scavenging the hydrogen\natoms. In order to avoid risks and side reactions linked to oxidants, we now propose to funnel away\nelectrons from the Pd catalyst to an anode, while the protons are cathodically reduced to H2. In this\ntranslation of a homogeneous catalytic reaction to an anodic process, electrode choice, ligand and\nmediator selection and electroreactor design are key elements. Mechanisms are investigated by\ncombining cyclic voltammetry with spectroscopy (e.g. XAS). Thorough attention is given to\nreactivating the catalyst, especially if the zerovalent Pd aggregates to large particles; chemical\ntreatments as well as electrochemical procedures are investigated to restore the activity. Since future\nethylene might be produced by electroreduction of CO2, we also examine whether the ethene-tobutadiene reaction would be sensitive to\nby-products of the CO2 reduction, like CO. Finally, the\nreaction’s scope is expanded to produce fine chemicals like medicines and fragrances by crosscoupling. \nLast modified: \n30-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
