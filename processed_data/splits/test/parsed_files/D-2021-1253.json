Unauthorized persons do not have\naccess to the folder containing the research data. Access can only be granted by the PI.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\n Digital data: KU Leuven policy on data management will be followed which entails a preservation\nterm of 5 years.\nPhysical data: Compound extracts and DNA and RNA samples will be stored at -20°C for 5 years\nafter the end of the project. Transformed bacterial strains will be stored at -80°C for 5 years after\nthe end of the project.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\n The data will be stored on the university’s central servers (with automatic back-up procedures)\nfor at least 5 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.

Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nYes. Specify:\nThe antimicrobial compounds might hold commercial value. If they do, we will collaborate with\nLRD to safeguard IP rights. This limits sharing of HPLC-MS, NMR and RNASeq data before\nensuring IP rights.\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\n The aim is to publish all data or make it at least available for relevant requests after the end of\nthe project. Data with valuable IP will be protected prior to publication.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn an Open Access repository\nOpen access data repositories and research papers.
