Data storage & back-up during the research project\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 12 January 2023\n3 of 6\nWhere will the data be stored?\nData used to produce project results will be stored in a GitLab repository with access control. The GitLab repository is hosted by a\nserver at our research department. In a later phase, and after the publication of the research paper concerned, the relevant data will be\nmade available in a public GitHub repository.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nWe make sure to replicate the data sets among at least two department computers.\nThe GitLab repository is hosted by a server at our research department and gets a daily backup.\nGitHub is a well-established, commercial repository service provider, which we assume to have industry-standard data availability\nmeasures in place (such that repositories will not be lost unless deleted by authorized GitHub users).\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThere is sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project. We have many terabytes of storage space available on the department\nmachines that we use to replicate our data sets. The department's GitLab instance and GitHub are offered services and are thus\nensured to have enough spare capacity.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nAccess to our department machines is managed by access to the university network and standard-practice user permissions on the\nmachine (only users with the right set of permissions can access the data, we control the management of these users).\nThe GitLab repository has access control and is maintained by a DMP officer who keeps the structure in the repository in place and\nmanages the access control. Unauthorized GitHub modifications are prevented through their industry-standard user management.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nThe costs of the GitLab maintenance are covered by our research group. These costs are integrated in the general IT costs. The use of\nGitHub is free of charge.\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after\nthe end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual\nrestrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\nAll the research data will be stored on the GitLab repository for at least 10 years after the end of the project. A selection of the research\ndata used to produce project results will be pushed to GitHub regularly. This will happen after the publication of a project paper. The\nGitHub will remain active for at least 10 years after the end of the project as well.\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nTo the extent feasible in terms of the volume of collected data, the data will be stored in the GitLab and GitHub repositories. If we\nconsider it necessary to purchase archival storage capacity for the entirety of the research project's artifacts (e.g., due to non-\nreproducibility of some data sets and limitations on the GitLab and GitHub services), we will do so appropriately and in time before the\nproject concludes. Options include the storage services offered by KU Leuven or dedicated storage hardware to be kept long-term at our\ndepartment.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period?

In the comment section please explain\nper dataset or data type which data will be made available.\nOther, please specify:\nRelevant data used to produce project results will be made available on GitHub.

If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.\nAll source code, protocols, and algorithms used for published articles will be made available as open source software on GitHub.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nTo the extent feasible due to volume of the collected data sets, we will make our data sets publicly available on GitHub upon publication\nof the corresponding article. In case a data set can be reproduced, we will also publish clear instructions/scripts for how to do so (so that\na large data set may also be recreated instead of downloaded).\nWhich data usage licenses are you going to provide?
