The effect of the belief in moral\nself-superiority on moral judgment, action, and sanctioning.\nA Data Management Plan created using DMPonline.be\nCreators: \nVera Hoorens, n.n. n.n.\nAffiliation: \nKU Leuven (KUL)\nFunder: \nFonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)\nTemplate: \nFWO DMP (Flemish Standard DMP)\nPrincipal Investigator:\n \nn.n. n.n., Vera Hoorens\nData Manager:\n \nn.n. n.n., Vera Hoorens\nProject Administrator:\n \nn.n. n.n., Vera Hoorens\nGrant number / URL: \nG052023N\nID: \n197154\nStart date: \n01-01-2023\nEnd date: \n31-12-2028\nProject abstract:\nMost people believe that they possess morally good traits more, and morally bad traits less, than others (moral self-superiority). However,\nlittle is known about how this moral self-superiority plays out in terms of moral judgments, moral actions, and responses to moral actions\nof others. Exploring these effects may be consequential because of the influence of people’s self-views on their behavior, the\nfundamentally comparative nature of these self-views, and the robust and general evidence for moral self-superiority. Moreover, moral\nchoices are ubiquitous in everyday life and almost all large-scale societal challenges have a moral component, from curbing pandemics\nto fighting poverty. Two competing hypotheses may be derived from the literature on moral behavior. One states that moral self-superiority\ndiscourages morally good choices, reduces appreciation for other people’s morally good choices, and enhances disapproval of their\nmorally bad ones. The other states that moral self-superiority facilitates morally good actions and inspires generosity and leniency towards\nothers. In this social psychological project we will pit the two perspectives against each other in a series of experiments and a longitudinal\nstudy. We will thus learn whether moral self-superiority ironically undermines people’s morality or amplifies people’s morality, an insight of\ngreat relevance in the domains of education, management, mental health, and personal growth.\nLast modified: \n31-03-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project. For each dataset or data type (observational,\nexperimental etc.), provide a short name & description (sufficient for yourself to know what data it is about), indicate whether the data are newly generated/collected or reused,\ndigital or physical, also indicate the type of the data (the kind of content), its technical format (file extension), and an estimate of the upper limit of the volume of the data.\n \nThe project will include 6 studies. Because the datasets will be structured identically across studies, we here describe the datasets once per type of dataset / study.\nThe names of the datasets are construed as follows:\nMoral_[study]_[type]                                                           \nwhere Moral = Short project name            \n[study] = the number of the study in the project    \n[type] = the type of data\nThe table summarizes the datasets that will in any case be construed. There may be more datasets, given that we will replicate at least some of the studies in special interest groups. These\ndatasets will then have the same name as the replicated study, but have names starting with 'Moral_Rep' rather than 'Moral_' \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnly for digital data\nOnly for digital\ndata \nOnly for digital\ndata \nOnly for\nphysical\ndata\nDataset Name\nDescription\nNew or reused\nDigital or\nPhysical\nDigital Data Type\nDigital Data format\nDigital data\nvolume\n(MB/GB/TB)\nPhysical\nvolume\n \n \nPlease choose\nfrom the\nfollowing\noptions:\nGenerate\nnew data\nReuse\nexisting\ndata\nPlease choose\nfrom the\nfollowing\noptions:\nDigital\nPhysical\nPlease choose from the following\noptions:\nObservational\nExperimental\nCompiled/aggregated data\nSimulation data\nSoftware\nOther\nNA\nPlease choose\nfrom the following\noptions:\n.por, .xml,\n.tab,\n.cvs,.pdf,\n.txt, .rtf,\n.dwg, .gml,\n…\nNA\nPlease choose\nfrom the\nfollowing\noptions:\n<100MB\n<1GB\n<100GB\n<1TB\n<5TB\n<10TB\n<50TB\n>50TB\nNA\n \nMoral_1_mat  Moral_2_mat\nMoral_3_mat  Moral_5_mat\nMoral_6_mat\nExperiments\nMaterials (1/study):\nInformation for informed consent\nExperimental  protocol, incl.\nmanipulations, instructions,\nstimuli, self-developed measures,\nreferences to published measures\nof dependent variables and\nindividual differences, software\nversion\nDebriefing information\nNew\nDigital\nTextual and graphical\nConstrued in MSWord by the research\nteam        (for actual use in study\nentered in Qualtrics, Inquisit, or\nPsychoPy). \n.docx, .pdf\n(original+open)\n \n<100MB\n \nMorality_4_mat\nLongitudinal study\nMaterials:\nInformation for informed consent\nSurveys used in each wave, incl.\ntasks, self-developed measures,\nreferences to published measures\nof individual differences, software\nversion\nDebriefing information\nNew \nDigital\n \nTextual and graphical\nConstrued in MSWord by the research\nteam        (for actual use in study\nentered in Qualtrics, Inquisit, or\nPsychoPy). \n.docx, .pdf\n(original+open)\n \n<100MB\n \n \nMoral_1_eth_appli Moral_2_eth_appli\nMoral_3_eth_appli Moral_4_eth_appli\nMoral_5_eth_appli Moral_6_eth_appli \nEthical/juridical clearance\napplication    (1/study), incl.\ninformed consent form,\ninformation on participant\nrecruitment, inclusion criteria\nNew\nDigital\n \nTextual\nConstrued online on the submission\nportal of SMEC and downloaded by\nresearch team.\n.pdf\n \n<100MB\n \n \nMoral_1_eth_appr Moral_2_eth_appr\nMoral_3_eth_appr Moral_4_eth_appr\nMoral_5_eth_appr Moral_6_eth_appr \nConfirmation  ethical/juridical\nclearance        (1/study)\nNew \nDigital\nTextual\nPrints of mails from Social and Societal\nEthical Committee\n.pdf \n<100MB\n \n \nMoral_1_pre Moral_2_pre Moral_3_pre\nMoral_4_pre Moral_5_pre Moral_6_pre\nPreregistration on Open Science\nFramework (1/study)\nNew\nDigital\n \nTextual\nConstrued in MSWord by research team\n.docx, .pdf\n(original+open)\n \n<100MB\n \n \nMoral_1_data Moral_2_data\nMoral_3_data  Moral_5_data\nMoral_6_data\nParticipants' responses to\nexperimental tasks, process\nmeasures,  suspicion probes,\ndemographics, individual\ndifferences (1/study)\nNew \n \nDigital\n \nTextual and numerical\nResponses of participants\n \n.sav, .dat|.csv\n(original+open)\n<100MB\n \nMoral_4_data \nParticipants' responses to\nsurveys, incl. demographics\nNew \n \nDigital\n \nTextual and numerical\nResponses of participants\n.sav, .dat|.csv\n(original+open)\n<100MB\n \nMoral_1_code Moral_2_code\nMoral_3_code Moral_4_code\nMoral_5_code Moral_6_code\nCodebook incl. information on\ndata collection procedures and\nevents, explanation of variables in\n_data files (1/study)\nNew \n \nDigital\nTextual, numerical\nConstrued in MS Word by research\nteam \n.docx, .pdf \n(original+open)\n \n<100MB\n \nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Describe these issues in the comment section.\nPlease refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate.\nYes, human subject data\nYes, as we will collect personal data. We will apply for ethical and GDPR clearance for that from the Social and Societal Ethical Committee (SMEC) during the preparation of each study. We will\nappropriately update both the DMP and the Compliance Monitoring Tool form (E-2023-3783) with the relevant SMEC-numbers.\nThe files with the suffix _data will contain participants' responses to experimental tasks and surveys. In addition, these files will include demographic data, which will at least include gender, age,\nand educational level, but may also include professional activity, political views, and/or religiosity. These data will be collected on adult healthy volunteers, who will have given informed consent\n(opt-in approach). \nWe are not yet certain if we will need to create all listed _contact datasets. If participants are from the iVox panel or from a platform like Prolific, we will not need them. If we are forced to recruit\nparticipants directly (e.g., if we need to include participants who are students participating for course credit), we will create _contact files for the administration of participant rewards. These files\nwill include e-mail addresses, names, and/or participant codes (e.g., EMS numbers). The dataset Moral_4_contact will then contain the most sensitive information because it will contain the\npseudonyms of the participants in the longitudinal study. \nWe will delete the _contact datafiles as soon as possible. In the case of students who participate for course credit, this is right after they have been rewarded. In the case of paid participants, it is\nimmediately after financial reporting about the study at hand to FWO has taken place.\nWill you process personal data? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate.\nYes\nThe personal data being included in the _data files will, in all studies, at least include gender, age, and educational level, but may also include professional activity, political views, and/or\nreligiosity.\nThe _contact files may include e-mail addresses, names, and/or participant codes (e.g., EMS numbers), and in the case of Moral_4_contact the pseudonyms of the participants in the longitudinal\nstudy. \nDoes your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type\nwhere appropriate.\nNo\nNot applicable.\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements/ research collaboration agreements)? If so,\nplease explain in the comment section to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.\nYes\nWe will enter a collaboration agreement between KU Leuven and University of Oregon. The intellectual property rights of the datasets will per this agreement be shared by those members of the\nresearch team who contribute to them. As per FWO regulations, this agreement will be formalized in the first 9 months of the project.\nAre there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain in the comment section to\nwhat data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.\nNo\nNot applicable.\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 31 March 2023\n6 of 9\n2. Documentation and Metadata\nClearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in\nthe future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is\nrecorded).\nIntroduction\nWe will organize the files in an overarching DRM folder called Morality. It will include\n1\n. \nA copy of this Data Management Plan (Morality_DMP)\n2\n. \nA DRM folder per study (Morality_[number of study]), to hold all files of the involved study\n3\n. \nA publications folder (Morality_Publication) to hold the _paper, _pres, and _outreach files\nInformation at the level of each study \nThe DRM folder of each study will include a README file in .txt format, named Morality_[number of study]_README. To create the README files we will fill out the template on \nREADME files -\nResearch Data Management (kuleuven.be). \nThey will in any case include the project name, keywords, name of involved researchers and their ORCID ID, name of funder, funding code, start- and\nend date of the project, DOIs of shared datasets, creative common license, the link to the preregistration on OSF, approval/registration code of ethical committee, links to publications. We will also\nadd the version of the software used to analyze the experimental data.\nFor version control procedures of defining milestones (e.g., draft, final) and subversions (e.g., V1, V2,…) will be implemented.\nInformation at the level of variables in _data files\nEach dataset with a name ending on '_data' (= datasets with experimental or longitudinal data) will go accompanied by a codebook (dataset ending on '_code') that will be stored in the same\nfolder (see Question 1). Because the '_data' and '_code' files will have identical names except for that part of the name and because they will be stored together, it will be clear which ones will\nbelong together.\nInformation at the level of papers and conference presentations\nFor ease of cross-reference between publications and studies, the publications folder will include, per _paper and _pres file, a simple README file in .txt format, named Morality_paper_[n]_ or\nMorality_pres_[n], respectively. This file will include links to the studies whose data were used for that publication. If applicable, the file will detail which part of the data from a study were used for\nthat particular publication.\nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be\nused. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.\nYes\nBecause we will upload the datasets in KU Leuven's RDR, we will use the metadata standard used there: \nfull-metadata-model (kuleuven.be).\nWe will for each dataset listed in the table under Question 1 fill out all required, recommended and optional fields except the following:\n- alternative title field (there will not be an alternative title)\n- alternative ID (there will be a single ID per dataset)\n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nAll Datasets, insofar as they do not contain highly confidential information:\n1\n. \nIn a shared folder on KULeuven OneDrive for Business.                                          \n2\n. \nStorage facilities of the research unit at KU Leuven: In a shared folder on a J: drive.\n3\n. \nPersonal devices of PIs and PhD student working on the project.\nThe files above will only be accessible to the PIs and PhD student working on the project. The offline copies on personal devices will be on encrypted media only.\nDatasets which include highly confidential information (e.g., _contact files) will be stored on a shielded J: drive, which can only be accessed by the data manager of the research unit.\nPreregistrations (& other datasets during editorial phase of manuscripts, except _contact, _eth_appli, and _eth_appr): on the OSF server in Frankfurt.\nEthical/juridical clearance files: on KU Leuven's Digital Privacy & Ethics Platform (PRET). \nHow will the data be backed up?\nThe automatic version management in OneDrive provides a backup of up to 100 versions.\nThere will be 2 additional backups:\n1\n. \nOn a shielded network drive of KU Leuven (J: drive, with a daily automatic backup)\n2\n. \nOn an encrypted external hard disk owned by PI Vera Hoorens.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThe available capacity on OneDrive for Business, the J-drive and personal devices of the PI Vera Hoorens is more than sufficient for the storage of all datasets pertaining to it. \nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nOneDrive for Business is a Microsoft cloud solution to securely store documents and files. The files will only be accessible by the involved researchers. Only PI Vera Hoorens can provide team\nmembers access to the OneDrive folder of the project. \nAccess to the OneDrive for Business files and the files on the J:-drive will be protected by multifactor authentication with the KU Leuven Authenticator app. \nAll personal devices used for backups or on which the members of the research team will temporarily store data to conduct analyses offline will be Bitlocker-protected.\nThe links to OSF files will be read-only. \nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 31 March 2023\n7 of 9\nThe data will be pseudonymized by removing highly sensitive data and storing these data separately from the research data on the shielded J: drive at KU Leuven. Access to these files will be\ncontrolled by the data manager, with PI Vera Hoorens as a backup. All other researchers who are involved in the project will have access to the pseudonymized data only.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nNo costs are expected.\nAll KU Leuven personnel has access to 2 TB of data storage for free on OneDrive. As the estimated sizes of the datasets <100 GB, sufficient storage and backup capacity is available.\nPI Vera Hoorens possesses several hard disks with storage capacities that are large enough to hold the datasets of all her projects. In case additional hard disks are necessary or costs do arise,\nthese will be covered with the obtained project funding.\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be\npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\nAll datafiles, except those with the suffix '_contact', will be retained for at least 10 years, in compliance with KU Leuven RDM policy. The files with the suffix '_contact' will be deleted as soon as\nparticipants have been rewarded for their participation (or, if the reward is financial, when the project is finished and due financial reporting to FWO has taken place).\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nBesides the KU Leuven OneDrive for business, all datasets will be stored and curated for the long-term on the KU Leuven institutional Research Data Repository (RDR) \nResearch Data\nRepository (RDR) - RDR - Research Data Repository (kuleuven.be).\nThe datasets that will be uploaded on OSF will in principle be archived indefinitely. However, the main archive for most files will be RDR. The main archive for papers and conference presentations\nwill be LIRIAS.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nNo costs are expected because of the limited size of the datasets. If costs arise nonetheless, they will covered with the obtained funding for the project and/or the research group of PI Vera\nHoorens.\n5. Data sharing and reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made\navailable.\nYes, in an Open Access repository\nWe will make the datasets for the relevant studies and of the following types publicly available: _pre, _mat, _data, _code, _syntax, _output. \nPublications will be made available through LIRIAS (and possibly also through other repositories, such as ResearchGate). Funding permitting, we will maximally publish Open Access such that\npublications are also openly available through the involved outlets.\nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.\nThe datasets that are listed under the previous question (i.e., datasets of the following types: _pre, _mat, _data, _code, _syntax, _output) will become publicly available after the publication of the\ninvolved research. These datasets will during the editorial process already be available to editors/reviewers of the publication outlets to which we submit manuscripts, under the condition that they\nshould be kept confidential and only serve to inform an editorial decision.\nThere are no further restrictions to share the pseudonymized data as the data do not contain highly sensitive information and participants will have given informed consent to share these data with\nother researchers.\nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment\nsection per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nYes, Privacy aspects\nThe datasets ending on '_contact' cannot be shared because of privacy issues.\nThe datasets ending on '_eth_appli' and '_eth_appr' will not be shared because the specific description of the intended samples may also create privacy issues.\nWhere will the data be made available?

    "clean_full_text": "Does feeling holier than others make one more or less moral? The effect of the belief in moral self-superiority on moral judgment, action, and sanctioning. A Data Management Plan created using DMPonline.be Creators: Vera Hoorens, n.n. n.n. Affiliation: KU Leuven (KUL) Funder: Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) Template: FWO DMP (Flemish Standard DMP) Principal Investigator: n.n. n.n., Vera Hoorens Data Manager: n.n. n.n., Vera Hoorens Project Administrator: n.n. n.n., Vera Hoorens Grant number / URL: G052023N ID: 197154 Start date: 01-01-2023 End date: 31-12-2028 Project abstract: Most people believe that they possess morally good traits more, and morally bad traits less, than others (moral self-superiority). However, little is known about how this moral self-superiority plays out in terms of moral judgments, moral actions, and responses to moral actions of others. Exploring these effects may be consequential because of the influence of people’s self-views on their behavior, the fundamentally comparative nature of these self-views, and the robust and general evidence for moral self-superiority. Moreover, moral choices are ubiquitous in everyday life and almost all large-scale societal challenges have a moral component, from curbing pandemics to fighting poverty. Two competing hypotheses may be derived from the literature on moral behavior. One states that moral self-superiority discourages morally good choices, reduces appreciation for other people’s morally good choices, and enhances disapproval of their morally bad ones. The other states that moral self-superiority facilitates morally good actions and inspires generosity and leniency towards others. In this social psychological project we will pit the two perspectives against each other in a series of experiments and a longitudinal study. We will thus learn whether moral self-superiority ironically undermines people’s morality or amplifies people’s morality, an insight of great relevance in the domains of education, management, mental health, and personal growth.

Application DMP Questionnaire Describe the datatypes (surveys, sequences, manuscripts, objects … ) the research will collect and/or generate and /or (re)use. (use up to 700 characters) We added the information below to the DMP Online platform after FWO had granted our application (as DMP Online was launched after the submission date). Rather than literally copying the information from our original application, we here report an updated version on the basis of the actual DMP. This information deviates from the information in the grant application due to, e.g., progressive insights in recommended data types. All data will be newly generated. The project will generate, per study: Experimental materials or surveys (Informed consent, protocol, measurement instruments, debriefing) Ethical and juridical (i.e., GDPR/privacy) clearance application and approval files Preregistration file Experimental or survey data, plus a codebook to accompany the data file Syntax file Output file [Depending on participant recruitment: possibly file with contact information] The project will also generate (per combination of studies): Publication manuscripts Conference presentations Outreach (dissemination) activities The experimental/survey data files and _contact files will include personal data. File types: Original files : .docx (texts), .sav (experimental/longitudinal data), .sps (statistical syntax), .spv (output of statistical analyses), .xlsx (contact information), .ppx (presentations) Portable types : .pdf (texts, presentations), .txt (texts), .dat (experimental/longitudinal data), .csv (experimental/longitudinal data), .rtf (syntax) Size: < 500GB. Specify in which way the following provisions are in place in order to preserve the data during and at least 5 years after the end of the research? Motivate your answer. (use up to 700 characters) The information below is an updated version of the information in the grant application. The only change is that it is more detailed. 1 . Designation of responsible person (If already designated, please fill in his/her name.) Vera Hoorens - Head of LESP & PI 2 . Storage capacity/repository as per KU Leuven policy (access between brackets): 1 . During: 1 . KULeuven OneDrive for Business (research team) 2 . Shielded space on J:-drive KU Leuven (research team) 3 . Personal device of PIs (involved PI) 2 . During & After, duration: 1 . Preregistrations: OSF Frankfurt (public), in principle indefinitely 2 . Ethical/privacy clearance documents (research team, SMEC & DPO): PRET-platform KULeuven, at least 10 years after the project 3 . After (public), duration after comma: 1 . Publications: Lirias Repository, in principle indefinitely 2 . Anonymized datasets, codebooks, syntax, output: KULeuven Research Data Repository (RDR), at least 10 years after the project What’s the reason why you wish to deviate from the principle of preservation of data and of the minimum preservation term of 5 years? (max. 700 characters) The information below is an updated version of the information in the approved grant application. The only change is that it is more detailed. We do not intent to deviate from the principle. In fact, we will preserve all but one type of datasets for at least 10 years. The exception involves the _contact files. We will delete these as soon as possible. Are there issues concerning research data indicated in the ethics questionnaire of this application form? Which specific security measures do those data require? (use up to 700 characters) Below, we literally copy information from the approved grant application. We will gain participants’ consent for storing data at least 10 years and sharing anonymous data. In Study 4, we will link the data of the waves with codes chosen by respondents or assigned by the managers of the platform/panel. We will enter binding written agreements with the managers of data collection platforms or participant panels that they shall not disclose identifications to us and that they will not access the dataset. Students involved in the research will sign confidentiality agreements and only have access to variables relevant to, and for the duration of their tasks. Researchers' temporary workfiles will be on encrypted drives. Datafiles on RDR will not include personal data. Which other issues related to the data management are relevant to mention? (use up to 700 characters) Below, we literally copy information from the approved grant application. We will submit an ethical application to the Social and Societal Ethics Committee KU Leuven (SMEC) and via that register the project/studies in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for Research and Public Service Purposes. For transparency, we will pre-register the studies on OSF. The data stored on RDR will have a persistent identifier and rich meta-data, and come with a create commons license. Besides storing files as described above, we will submit the data underlying the results reported in specific papers as supplemental materials with those papers. Our readiness to share materials has already been shown (cf. http://www.psychfiledrawer.org/files/8291448480580more_less_replication). Created using DMPonline.be.

For each dataset or data type (observational, experimental etc.), provide a short name & description (sufficient for yourself to know what data it is about), indicate whether the data are newly generated/collected or reused, digital or physical, also indicate the type of the data (the kind of content), its technical format (file extension), and an estimate of the upper limit of the volume of the data. The project will include 6 studies. Because the datasets will be structured identically across studies, we here describe the datasets once per type of dataset / study. The names of the datasets are construed as follows: Moral_[study]_[type] where Moral = Short project name [study] = the number of the study in the project [type] = the type of data The table summarizes the datasets that will in any case be construed. There may be more datasets, given that we will replicate at least some of the studies in special interest groups. These datasets will then have the same name as the replicated study, but have names starting with 'Moral_Rep' rather than 'Moral_' Only for digital data Only for digital data Only for digital data Only for physical data Dataset Name Description New or reused Digital or Physical Digital Data Type Digital Data format Digital data volume (MB/GB/TB) Physical volume Please choose from the following options: Generate new data Reuse existing data Please choose from the following options: Digital Physical Please choose from the following options: Observational Experimental Compiled/aggregated data Simulation data Software Other NA Please choose from the following options: .por, .xml, .tab, .cvs,.pdf, .txt, .rtf, .dwg, .gml, … NA Please choose from the following options: <100MB <1GB <100GB <1TB <5TB <10TB <50TB >50TB NA Moral_1_mat Moral_2_mat Moral_3_mat Moral_5_mat Moral_6_mat Experiments Materials (1/study): Information for informed consent Experimental protocol, incl. manipulations, instructions, stimuli, self-developed measures, references to published measures of dependent variables and individual differences, software version Debriefing information New Digital Textual and graphical Construed in MSWord by the research team (for actual use in study entered in Qualtrics, Inquisit, or PsychoPy). .docx, .pdf (original+open) <100MB Morality_4_mat Longitudinal study Materials: Information for informed consent Surveys used in each wave, incl. tasks, self-developed measures, references to published measures of individual differences, software version Debriefing information New Digital Textual and graphical Construed in MSWord by the research team (for actual use in study entered in Qualtrics, Inquisit, or PsychoPy). .docx, .pdf (original+open) <100MB Moral_1_eth_appli Moral_2_eth_appli Moral_3_eth_appli Moral_4_eth_appli Moral_5_eth_appli Moral_6_eth_appli Ethical/juridical clearance application (1/study), incl. informed consent form, information on participant recruitment, inclusion criteria New Digital Textual Construed online on the submission portal of SMEC and downloaded by research team. .pdf <100MB Moral_1_eth_appr Moral_2_eth_appr Moral_3_eth_appr Moral_4_eth_appr Moral_5_eth_appr Moral_6_eth_appr Confirmation ethical/juridical clearance (1/study) New Digital Textual Prints of mails from Social and Societal Ethical Committee .pdf <100MB Moral_1_pre Moral_2_pre Moral_3_pre Moral_4_pre Moral_5_pre Moral_6_pre Preregistration on Open Science Framework (1/study) New Digital Textual Construed in MSWord by research team .docx, .pdf (original+open) <100MB Moral_1_data Moral_2_data Moral_3_data Moral_5_data Moral_6_data Participants' responses to experimental tasks, process measures, suspicion probes, demographics, individual differences (1/study) New Digital Textual and numerical Responses of participants .sav, .dat|.csv (original+open) <100MB Moral_4_data Participants' responses to surveys, incl. demographics New Digital Textual and numerical Responses of participants .sav, .dat|.csv (original+open) <100MB Moral_1_code Moral_2_code Moral_3_code Moral_4_code Moral_5_code Moral_6_code Codebook incl. information on data collection procedures and events, explanation of variables in _data files (1/study) New Digital Textual, numerical Construed in MS Word by research team .docx, .pdf (original+open) <100MB Created using DMPonline.be.

Describe these issues in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. Yes, human subject data Yes, as we will collect personal data. We will apply for ethical and GDPR clearance for that from the Social and Societal Ethical Committee (SMEC) during the preparation of each study. We will appropriately update both the DMP and the Compliance Monitoring Tool form (E-2023-3783) with the relevant SMEC-numbers. The files with the suffix _data will contain participants' responses to experimental tasks and surveys. In addition, these files will include demographic data, which will at least include gender, age, and educational level, but may also include professional activity, political views, and/or religiosity. These data will be collected on adult healthy volunteers, who will have given informed consent (opt-in approach). We are not yet certain if we will need to create all listed _contact datasets. If participants are from the iVox panel or from a platform like Prolific, we will not need them. If we are forced to recruit participants directly (e.g., if we need to include participants who are students participating for course credit), we will create _contact files for the administration of participant rewards. These files will include e-mail addresses, names, and/or participant codes (e.g., EMS numbers). The dataset Moral_4_contact will then contain the most sensitive information because it will contain the pseudonyms of the participants in the longitudinal study. We will delete the _contact datafiles as soon as possible. In the case of students who participate for course credit, this is right after they have been rewarded. In the case of paid participants, it is immediately after financial reporting about the study at hand to FWO has taken place. Will you process personal data? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. Yes The personal data being included in the _data files will, in all studies, at least include gender, age, and educational level, but may also include professional activity, political views, and/or religiosity. The _contact files may include e-mail addresses, names, and/or participant codes (e.g., EMS numbers), and in the case of Moral_4_contact the pseudonyms of the participants in the longitudinal study. Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. No Not applicable. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements/ research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. Yes We will enter a collaboration agreement between KU Leuven and University of Oregon. The intellectual property rights of the datasets will per this agreement be shared by those members of the research team who contribute to them. As per FWO regulations, this agreement will be formalized in the first 9 months of the project. Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. No Not applicable. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 31 March 2023 6 of 9 2. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). Introduction We will organize the files in an overarching DRM folder called Morality. It will include 1 . A copy of this Data Management Plan (Morality_DMP) 2 . A DRM folder per study (Morality_[number of study]), to hold all files of the involved study 3 . A publications folder (Morality_Publication) to hold the _paper, _pres, and _outreach files Information at the level of each study The DRM folder of each study will include a README file in .txt format, named Morality_[number of study]_README. To create the README files we will fill out the template on README files - Research Data Management (kuleuven.be). They will in any case include the project name, keywords, name of involved researchers and their ORCID ID, name of funder, funding code, start- and end date of the project, DOIs of shared datasets, creative common license, the link to the preregistration on OSF, approval/registration code of ethical committee, links to publications. We will also add the version of the software used to analyze the experimental data. For version control procedures of defining milestones (e.g., draft, final) and subversions (e.g., V1, V2,…) will be implemented. Information at the level of variables in _data files Each dataset with a name ending on '_data' (= datasets with experimental or longitudinal data) will go accompanied by a codebook (dataset ending on '_code') that will be stored in the same folder (see Question 1). Because the '_data' and '_code' files will have identical names except for that part of the name and because they will be stored together, it will be clear which ones will belong together. Information at the level of papers and conference presentations For ease of cross-reference between publications and studies, the publications folder will include, per _paper and _pres file, a simple README file in .txt format, named Morality_paper_[n]_ or Morality_pres_[n], respectively. This file will include links to the studies whose data were used for that publication. If applicable, the file will detail which part of the data from a study were used for that particular publication. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. Yes Because we will upload the datasets in KU Leuven's RDR, we will use the metadata standard used there: full-metadata-model (kuleuven.be). We will for each dataset listed in the table under Question 1 fill out all required, recommended and optional fields except the following: - alternative title field (there will not be an alternative title) - alternative ID (there will be a single ID per dataset) 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? All Datasets, insofar as they do not contain highly confidential information: 1 . In a shared folder on KULeuven OneDrive for Business. 2 . Storage facilities of the research unit at KU Leuven: In a shared folder on a J: drive. 3 . Personal devices of PIs and PhD student working on the project. The files above will only be accessible to the PIs and PhD student working on the project. The offline copies on personal devices will be on encrypted media only. Datasets which include highly confidential information (e.g., _contact files) will be stored on a shielded J: drive, which can only be accessed by the data manager of the research unit. Preregistrations (& other datasets during editorial phase of manuscripts, except _contact, _eth_appli, and _eth_appr): on the OSF server in Frankfurt. Ethical/juridical clearance files: on KU Leuven's Digital Privacy & Ethics Platform (PRET). How will the data be backed up? The automatic version management in OneDrive provides a backup of up to 100 versions. There will be 2 additional backups: 1 . On a shielded network drive of KU Leuven (J: drive, with a daily automatic backup) 2 . On an encrypted external hard disk owned by PI Vera Hoorens. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes The available capacity on OneDrive for Business, the J-drive and personal devices of the PI Vera Hoorens is more than sufficient for the storage of all datasets pertaining to it. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? OneDrive for Business is a Microsoft cloud solution to securely store documents and files. The files will only be accessible by the involved researchers. Only PI Vera Hoorens can provide team members access to the OneDrive folder of the project. Access to the OneDrive for Business files and the files on the J:-drive will be protected by multifactor authentication with the KU Leuven Authenticator app. All personal devices used for backups or on which the members of the research team will temporarily store data to conduct analyses offline will be Bitlocker-protected. The links to OSF files will be read-only. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 31 March 2023 7 of 9 The data will be pseudonymized by removing highly sensitive data and storing these data separately from the research data on the shielded J: drive at KU Leuven. Access to these files will be controlled by the data manager, with PI Vera Hoorens as a backup. All other researchers who are involved in the project will have access to the pseudonymized data only. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? No costs are expected. All KU Leuven personnel has access to 2 TB of data storage for free on OneDrive. As the estimated sizes of the datasets <100 GB, sufficient storage and backup capacity is available. PI Vera Hoorens possesses several hard disks with storage capacities that are large enough to hold the datasets of all her projects. In case additional hard disks are necessary or costs do arise, these will be covered with the obtained project funding. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). All datafiles, except those with the suffix '_contact', will be retained for at least 10 years, in compliance with KU Leuven RDM policy. The files with the suffix '_contact' will be deleted as soon as participants have been rewarded for their participation (or, if the reward is financial, when the project is finished and due financial reporting to FWO has taken place). Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Besides the KU Leuven OneDrive for business, all datasets will be stored and curated for the long-term on the KU Leuven institutional Research Data Repository (RDR) Research Data Repository (RDR) - RDR - Research Data Repository (kuleuven.be). The datasets that will be uploaded on OSF will in principle be archived indefinitely. However, the main archive for most files will be RDR. The main archive for papers and conference presentations will be LIRIAS. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? No costs are expected because of the limited size of the datasets. If costs arise nonetheless, they will covered with the obtained funding for the project and/or the research group of PI Vera Hoorens. 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in an Open Access repository We will make the datasets for the relevant studies and of the following types publicly available: _pre, _mat, _data, _code, _syntax, _output. Publications will be made available through LIRIAS (and possibly also through other repositories, such as ResearchGate). Funding permitting, we will maximally publish Open Access such that publications are also openly available through the involved outlets. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. The datasets that are listed under the previous question (i.e., datasets of the following types: _pre, _mat, _data, _code, _syntax, _output) will become publicly available after the publication of the involved research. These datasets will during the editorial process already be available to editors/reviewers of the publication outlets to which we submit manuscripts, under the condition that they should be kept confidential and only serve to inform an editorial decision. There are no further restrictions to share the pseudonymized data as the data do not contain highly sensitive information and participants will have given informed consent to share these data with other researchers. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes, Privacy aspects The datasets ending on '_contact' cannot be shared because of privacy issues. The datasets ending on '_eth_appli' and '_eth_appr' will not be shared because the specific description of the intended samples may also create privacy issues. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. KU Leuven institutional Research Data Repository (RDR): Research Data Repository (RDR) - RDR - Research Data Repository (kuleuven.be). Publications will be made available through LIRIAS (and possibly also through other repositories, such as ResearchGate). When will the data be made available? The datasets (of the following types: _pre, _mat, _data, _code, _syntax, _output) will be made available after the involved studies have been accepted for publication. They will during and after the project thus gradually become available. At the end of the project, the data of unpublished studies will be made available after an embargo period of 5 years to give the research team enough time to consider publication after the end of the project. These datasets will during the editorial process already be available to editors/reviewers of the publication outlets to which we submit manuscripts, under the condition that they should be kept confidential and only serve to inform an editorial decision. Publications will become available on LIRIAS (or other repositories) as soon as the copyright agreement with the involved outlet allows. However, we will (funding permitting) maximally publish Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 31 March 2023 8 of 9 Open Access such that publications immediately become available. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. CC Attribution 4.0 International Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. Yes DOIs will be available through RDR, but are not yet available. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? RDR and LIRIAS are free for KU Leuven personnel, hence, no costs are expected for data sharing. 6. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project? The PhD researcher will manage the data, supervised and backed-up by PI Vera Hoorens Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project? The PhD researcher will manage data storage and backup, supervised by PIs Vera Hoorens and Sara Hodges Who will manage data preservation and sharing? During the project, the PhD researcher will manage data preservation and sharing. After the project, PIs Vera Hoorens and Sara Hodges will do so. Who will update and implement this DMP? The PhD researcher will update this DMP, with PIs Vera Hoorens and Sara Hodges bearing the final responsibility. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 31 March 2023 9 of 9"
