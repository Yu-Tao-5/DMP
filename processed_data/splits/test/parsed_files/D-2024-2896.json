The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning.

Only relevant files will  \nbe stored permanently, excluding test runs, faulty measurements etc. The latter are considered non-essential working files and will only be  \navailable during the project and maximum 1 year after its end. In addition to these raw data files, analysis files (e.g. spreadsheets and written  \nmanuscripts) are stored after completion of project phase (e.g. completion of paper or internal deadlines). The majority of data is digital an within  \nthe <100 MB size range.\nDuring the project’s execution term, all data is available on the researchers and promotors personal laptops, which are backed up by the  \nuniversities IT controlled systems (personal sharepoint, professional account). Furthermore, a shared KUL-VUB teams site is used as to terms data  \nin a secure way, giving additional backups of essential data. Long term storage and accessibility after the project is completed is secured by stored  \nthe essential information on the promotors laptops (with sharepoint backup) as well as an external harddrive within university offices (with  \naccess control).

WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.Project data will be backed up to the Personal KU Leuven Network Drive account. Data will also be backed up monthly on the researcher’s personal external hard drive. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: I estimated the data from this project to not exceed the 50 Gb . If no, please specify: 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7The researcher’s personal laptop or computer (where the data are first stored) is password and fingerprint-protected, which will help prevent the data from being misused. The external hard drive will be kept in a secure location in the promotor's office. The KU Leuven OneDrive account is password-protected and can only be accessed via KU Leuven Authenticator. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?No additional costs are required for data storage for this project. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All the stored data will be retained for at least 5 years after the research period. The data that are made available on the KU Leuven repository (RDR) will be preserved for at least 10 years. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?Beyond the minimal storage period, the promotor can decide whether the retained data are worth keeping or not. Data referring to publications or ongoing projects are always maintained on the external drive and delivered to the newcomers. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?The costs for buying an external drive has been already paid, no additional costs are needed. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 116. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY.

If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.Publication date When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.Publication date Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED.
