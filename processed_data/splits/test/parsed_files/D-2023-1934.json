To alleviate the pressure on truck transport, one can bundle shipments with other\ncompanies, or shift more freight to alternative transport modes, such as train or inland\nwaterways. In this research, we will develop ordering policies to facilitate freight bundling and a\nmodal shift to reduce the truck intensity of supply chains. To achieve this goal, three research\nobjectives are stipulated: (1) develop ordering policies for freight bundling using one transport\nmode; (2) develop ordering policies for freight bundling using two transport modes; and (3) use\ndeep reinforcement learning to improve ordering policies for freight bundling using two transport\nmodes. With this research, we contribute to the state-of-the-art by combining the multi-modal\nand collaborative literature, and by providing decision-making support for multi-modal,\ncollaborative supply chains.\nLast modified: \n06-02-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
