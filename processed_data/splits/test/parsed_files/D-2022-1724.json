The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning.

How \nwill these costs be covered?KU Leuven provides multiple options for (long term) data storage. Type 1 server backend storage with \nmirror backup for the FWO-SB project folder will cost € 270 per TB per year. The estimated maximal cost \nfor the 4-year project would therefore be € 1080. Large datasets that do not require frequent access can \nbe stored on a separate server for large volume storage, costing € 113,84 per TB per year. The estimated \nmaximal cost for the 4-year project would therefore be € 455,36 if this type of data storage is required. All \ncosts will be covered by the project budget.\n5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five \nyears (or longer, in agreement with other \nretention policies that are applicable) after the \nend of the project? In case some data cannot be  \npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this  \n(e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All data obtained during this project will be retained for the expected 5 year period.\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long-term)?The digital data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic backup procedures) for at  \nleast 5 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.\nBOF (Flemish Standard DMP) 11What are the expected costs for data \npreservation during the expected retention \nperiod? How will these costs be covered?Cost of the large volume storage will be € 128,39 per TB and year. We anticipate that we will need 1 TB for  \n5 years to keep the essential data available. This will amount to € 614,95 and will be covered by the \nproject's budget.\nBOF (Flemish Standard DMP) 126. Data Sharing and Reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made \navailable for reuse after/during the project?  \nPlease explain per dataset or data type which \ndata will be made available.  \nNOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE \nDATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS \nAND USE MAY APPLY.

CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7All online services (except open-source) are provided by the University (affiliated Microsoft account). 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ BOF (Flemish Standard DMP) 10What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?KU Leuven provides multiple options for (long term) data storage. Type 1 server backend storage with mirror backup for the FWO-SB project folder will cost € 270 per TB per year. The estimated maximal cost for the 4-year project would therefore be € 1080. Large datasets that do not require frequent access can be stored on a separate server for large volume storage, costing € 113,84 per TB per year. The estimated maximal cost for the 4-year project would therefore be € 455,36 if this type of data storage is required. All costs will be covered by the project budget. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All data obtained during this project will be retained for the expected 5 year period. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?The digital data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic backup procedures) for at least 5 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. BOF (Flemish Standard DMP) 11What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Cost of the large volume storage will be € 128,39 per TB and year. We anticipate that we will need 1 TB for 5 years to keep the essential data available. This will amount to € 614,95 and will be covered by the project's budget. BOF (Flemish Standard DMP) 126. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☐ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☒ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Before the publication, all data can only be accessed by relevant colleagues of KU Leuven. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.For the work published, in principal codes will be available at Github. BOF (Flemish Standard DMP) 13When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.After publications. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 The codes are with MIT license. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes: What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? 0 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ BOF (Flemish Standard DMP) 147.
