The complex legal EU framework and in particular the divergent application of the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation, currently challenge the conduct of research. New policy initiatives, such as the European Health Data Space,\npromise to address the existing complexities and facilitate research, while simultaneously empowering patients by strengthening their control over their\npersonal data. However, the patients’ voice is still predominantly missing in the academic debate on these topics, and it is not clear whether patient\nempowerment could indeed foster research, while allowing for meaningful protection of the fundamental right to data protection. The goal of this\nproject is to elucidate the relationship between patient empowerment and biomedical research in the EU, via a combination of legal and sociomedical\nresearch. A mixed methods design will be employed: desk research will be complemented with empirical research (qualitative and quantitative). A\ndiscrete choice experiment, semi-structured interviews, and a Delphi study will be conducted with biomedical research stakeholders (patients and\npatient representatives, academic and commercial sponsors of clinical trials, investigators, physicians, regulators, and ethics committees).\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n28-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
