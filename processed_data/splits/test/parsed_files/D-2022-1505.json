In contrast to  the current design -by-analysis approach, an efficient optimization \nstrategy will be elaborated that automatically computes the design which best fits selected design criteria, \nsubject to complex design and operational constraints. Uncertainty in model par ameters and operational \nvariability will be accounted for through a rigorous framework of uncertainty quantification. The project will \ngenerate simulation data to test computational methods and illustrate their performance.  \nInstitution: KU Leuven  \n \n1. GE NERAL INFORMATION  \nName applicant  \nBaelmans Martine (Applied Mechanics and Energy Conversion)  \nSamaey Giovanni (Num erical Analysis and Applied Mathematics)  \nDekeyser Wouter (Applied Mechanics and Energy Conversion)  \n \nFWO Project Number & Title  \nG085922N  \nEfficient algorithms for robust divertor shape and magnetic field design for nuclear fusion  reactors  \nEfficiënte algoritmes voor robuust ontwerp van divertoren voor kernfusiereactoren  \n \nAffiliation  \n● KU Leuven  \n \n2. DATA DESCRIPTION  \nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?  \n● Generate new data  \n● Reuse existing data  \n \nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. \nThis may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and per WP or objective of the \n2 project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of th ese data.  Distinguish data types (the \nkind of content) from data formats (the technical format).  \n- Source code for simulation software: text files in syntax of programming lan guage (Matlab,  Python, \nC/C++, Fortran ) \n- Code documentation: text files & pdf files  \n- Research manuscripts and publications: LaTeX files & pdf files  \n- Simulation data: computed solutions using simulation software: Matlab data file format (.mat),  hdf5, csv \nfiles, simulation -code -specific output formats  \n- Postprocessed data: figures & tables: pdf & text, along with scripts to reproduce from  simulation data  \n \nSize of data is not an issue at all, and is directly determined by the parameters used in the  \ncomputation al methods and by the number of simulations. At most a few terabytes over the  \ncourse of the project.  \n \n3. LEGAL AND ETHICAL ISSUES  \nWill you use personal data?  If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add the \nreference to your file in K U Leuven's Register of Data Processing for Research and Public Service \nPurposes (PRET application).   Be aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is \na legal obligation.  \n● No \nPrivacy Registry Reference:  \nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used:  \n \nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on \nhumans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant \nethical review committee(s)  \n● No \n \nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? \nWill IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions \nwill be asserted?  \n● No \n \nDo existing 3rd party agreements  restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If \nso, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?  \n● No \n \n  \n3 4. DOCUMENTATION AND METADATA  \nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this \nproject?  \n- Source code for simulation software: version control  \n- Code documentation: version control  \n- Research manuscripts and publications: version control and archiving of associated research  data \n- Simulation data & postprocessing data: document the experiments and their outcome for  reproducibility \n(code version, scripts, data files). Use of standardized storage scripts for archiving  of important data.  \n \nWe are involved in a pilot project at KU Leuven in which the above processes will be automated  and \ncomplete computational experiments with goals, scripts for experiments, resulting data, and  \npostprocessing scripts will be stored as a completely reproducible \"computational experiment\" in  the \nsoftw are environment iRods, which is coupled to the KU Leuven gitlab servers where all  version control \ntakes place. We will also install a continuous integration workflow that ensures  software integrity as the \nsoftware evolves. (This automation procedure will b e gradually  implemented in this FWO project, but the \nreproducibility policy - keeping all scripts, data and  postprocessing together to ensure reproducibility) is \nalready in place.   \nFor version control of the simulation software, repositories on the KU Leuve n gitlab server are  already in \nplace.  \n \nWill a metadata standard be used? If so,  describe in detail which standard will be used.  If no, \nstate in detail which metadata will be created to make t he data easy/easier to find and reuse.  \n● No \nWe use a standard solution (iRods), but the format of the metadata is tailored to our specific needs of \ncomputational experiments.  \n \n \n5. DATA STORAGE AND BACKUP DURING THE FWO PROJECT  \nWhere will the data be stored?   \n- File synchronization (devices/collaborators) and backup: for version -controlled files, we use the  KU \nLeuven gitlab service. For other files, we use KU Leuven OneDrive. At the department of  comput er \nscience, a custom solution, based on NextCloud, is also available.  \n- Large simulation results are stored on a dedicated archive on the cluster.  \n- When possible, all relevant data will be made publicly available with the paper. For this, we will  use a \ncoupling betweeen iRods and the new KU Leuven RDR system that is designed  for this   purpose.  \n- Manuscripts and all corresponding data are stored on an archive drive in the research group  and/or on \nan archive drive at the VSC depending on the nature of the research data.  \n \n \n \n4 How is backup of the data provided?  \nAll solutions described above are equipped with automated back -up procedures that are provided by the \ncentral university services.  \nPersonal laptops of researchers are synced with their homedirectory on the department al servers. These \nservers are backed up as per the above.  \n \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will \nbe taken care of.  \n● Yes \nKU Leuven OneDrive services and dedicated archive storage on the VSC (presently 3TB archive storage \navailable to the project) suffice to store the data.  \nExtensions to the archive can be obtained throughout the project via the VSC if n eeded.  \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these \ncosts be covered?  \nBecause  we are involved in pilot projects at the university level, all costs associated to data management \nare currently covered by the university.  This situation will probably change in the future, and will depend \non policy that the university still needs to develop. We expect data management costs to be eligible costs \nfrom the working budget of research projects.  \n \nData security: how wi ll you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified \nby unauthorized persons?  \nAll systems described above allow configuration to prohibit access to unauthorized persons.  Additionally, \nall data of computational experiments stored in  iRods will be read -only, also avoiding accidental changes \nby authorized persons.  \n \n \n6. DATA PRESERVATION AFTER THE FWO PROJECT  \nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case \nonly a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or \ncontractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).  \nAll simulation code, simulation data, scripts and figures/tables that are needed to reproduce published \nresults will be available in open access repositories and findable via a link in the publication.  \nAdditionally, all data in iRods will be retained in i Rods for as long as useful (and certainly for the legally \nrequired time).  \n \nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?  \n- Manuscripts and all corresponding data are stored on an archive drive in the research group and/or on \nan archive d rive at the VSC depending on the nature of the research data.  \n- We are involved in a pilot to use iRods for this purpose.  \n5 - We are committed to making the data available in open access repositories (see above).  \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data pres ervation during the retention period of 5 years? How will \nthe costs be covered?  \nBecause  we are involved in pilot projects at the university level, all costs associated to data management \nare currently covered by the university.  This situation will probab ly change in the future, and will depend \non policy that the university still needs to develop. We expect data management costs to be eligible costs \nfrom the working budget of research projects.  \nArchive storage at the VSC currently costs 100 EUR/TB/year (w ith 3TB available to the project).  \n \n \n7. DATA SHARING AND REUSE  \nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in \nan agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?  \n● No \n \nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?  \n- When possible, all relevant data will be made publicly available with the paper.  For this, we will use a \ncoupling betwee n iRods and the new KU Leuven RDR system that is designed for this p urpose.    \n \nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?  \n● In an Open Access repository  \nAt least in KU Leuven RDR. Potentially also data repositories that are coupled to the journal in which the \npublication appeared.  \n \nWhen will the data be made available?  \n● Upon publication of the research results  \n \nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?  \nFull data is publicly available. Acknowledgement of will be required via license .  \n \nWhat are the expected costs f or data sharing? How will the costs be covered?   \nBecause  we are involved in pilot projects at the university level, all costs associated to data management \nare currently covered by the university.
