This highlights the need for novel\nmethods to manipulate emotional memories, to help people forget burdensome events. Directed\nforgetting manipulations have been repeatedly applied in declarative memory research to\ninvestigate intentional, instructed forgetting. We recently developed a novel directed forgetting\nfear conditioning procedure aimed at examining instructed forgetting of emotional, rather than\ndeclarative memories. In a series of studies, we observed a clear memory deficit for items that\nwere instructed to be forgotten during encoding, as well as an attenuation of physiological fear\nexpression (i.e., skin conductance reactivity) in relation to those items. While this work holds\ntremendous potential for memory therapeutics, many fundamental questions remain\nunanswered. This proposal aspires to corroborate and expand these initial findings by a)\nmanipulating experiment-specific and biological factors that may play a role in the observation of\nthe directed forgetting effect, b) investigating individual characteristics hypothesized to facilitate\nand impede directed forgetting, and c) exploiting directed forgetting to disrupt the expression of\npreviously acquired memories upon their retrieval rather than initial encoding.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
