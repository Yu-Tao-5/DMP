The EU\nagro-industrial sector, in particular, was among the most hard-hit during the first stage of EU\nborder closures due to its reliance on seasonal, mobile migrant workers. At the same time, the\ngovernance of the pandemic has created new borders and frontiers: while unnecessary mobility\nis forbidden or strongly discouraged, migrants and racialized labourers are overrepresented on\nthe frontline of infection risk, under the banner of \"essential workers\" This research project\naddresses the urgent question of the social life of the virus (and the social inequalities that\nunderlie its transmission) by specifically focusing on the consequences that multifarious border\nregimes have on labour relations in the EU agro-industrial sector. LABOR-PAS comparatively\nfocuses on three significant models of work organization in the Italian and Belgian agro-industrial\nsector in pre-, ongoing- (and, if possible, post-) pandemic scenarios: the (refugee-based) harvest\nof tomatoes in Borgo Mezzanone and the (posted-work-based) meat processing in the\nslaughterhouse of Anderlecht, Bruxelles. LABOR-PAS seeks to answer the following questions: 1)\nWhich is the role of states in producing domestic labour shortages, on the one side, and ensuring\nthe supply of low-cost foreign labour, on the other, in \"normal\" and \"exceptional\" (i.e. lockdown)\ntimes?(Research Objective 1, corresponding to WP1) and 2) How do workers during the Covid-19\npandemic engage in everyday politics and radical forms of care? How is their perception of\ninfection risk elaborated, in comparison with other risks (such as job loss)? Which values and\nmeaning sustain the discourses and practices of other relevant labour actors (employers,\nrecruiters, labour inspectors)? (Research Objective 2, corresponding to WP2). Desk research (on\npolicy texts, regulations, transcriptions of parliamentary debates, news articles, public\nstatements from companies) will be complemented with ethnographic research. In the two fields,\nethnographic research will be carried out among three main target groups: 1) migrant workers,\n2) employers, 3) workers union representatives, labour inspectors, recruiters/intermediaries and\nother relevant stakeholders. Beyond traditional, face-to-face fieldwork, experimental,\ncollaborative and multimodal ethnographies will be developed to overcome the limits related\nwith the specific features of research fields themselves (workplaces, vulnerable workers). In\nparticular, the researcher will engage with representatives of workers unions and migrant\nworkers groups to design and carry out interviews, recruit participants among workers and elicit\nthe production of data by workers themselves (photos, videos, vocal messages, diaries). In each\ncase-study, approximately 15 workers will be engaged in digital data generation and 15\ncomprehensive interviews will be carried out with workers, employers, recruiters, labours\ninspectors and trade union representatives (30 workers engaged and 30 interviews in total).\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nYes\nPrivacy Registry Reference: \nG-2021-4126\nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used:\n1) Participants' names and surnames\n2) Contact details (telephone number or email, or both)\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 5\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nYes\nDuring its plenary discussion (April 2022), SMEC has decided that my PRET application (\nreference\nnumber \nG-2021-4126-R3(MIN) \nmeets the standards for academic research.\nIn the application I declare that all respondents will be pseudonymized in the file names and\ntyped documents (field notes and interview transcriptions). As a precautionary measure, contact\ninformation of any respondents, contact persons, meeting points or data on individuals\napproached during interviews, as well as the correspondence between pseudonyms and real\nnames, will only be kept on a double-encrypted USB device, locked in a drawer in my office at KU\nLeuven. This means that real names and contact information will be separate from the rest of\ndata.\nConcerning interviews, original audio files will be deleted after transcription.\nConcernin audiovisual files (audio recordings, pictures, videos), the PI is aware specific legal\nconstraints exist for the use of images and audio recordings; she is aware as well that it is\npossible that some of the audiovisual data will enable to identify the participant himself/herself or\nother participants. However, the purpose for the collection of this specific type of data is mere\nanalysis. This means that these data will not be disseminated. As such, they wonâ€™t be made\npublic nor shared with other parties. They will form part of the data on which qualitative analysis\nwill be based. Files will be encrypted and securely stored on the KU Leuven network storage\nspace. \nResearch publications may contain strictly pseudonymized parts of the data, in the form of direct\nor indirect quotes, or descriptions of human interactions in observed situations. Any research\noutput will be sistematically and rigorously checked prior to publication to ensure that research\nparticipants are not recognisable. Collected data will not be publicly available in any other form\napart from such publications, and will not be part of any open data initiatives.\nAs regards informed consent forms, they will brief participants on data management procedures\nand will remind them that they are able to contact the researcher and ask their consent to be\nwithdrawn and their data omitted. It will be indicated that such a request could only be handled\nuntil the point of submission to external publication. They will be signed by hand on paper and\nimmediately scanned. Only the the scanned copy will be stored, while the original copy will be\ndeleted. If possible, they will be signed directly in digital form.\n \nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nFor the interviews, details on the setting of the interviews, the informed consent process, the\nsubjects discussed and the instructions given to interviewers will be documented in a Word\ndocument.\nTranscription of interviews are going to be pseudonymised and corresponding audio recordings\nwill be deleted after transcription.\nThe correspondence between pseudonyms and real names will be kept on an Excel file that, as\nstated in my answers to the point 3 (Legal and Ethical Issues), will be stored on an double-\nencrypted USB device that, in turn, will be locked in a drawer in my KU Leuven office. This means\nthat the correspondence between pseudonyms and real names will be kept separate from the\nrest of data, to limit negative consequence of an (unlikely) data loss.\nFor each audiovisual file (audio recordings, pictures, videos), details on the location, the time and\nthe pseudonym of the participant who generated it will be documented in a Word document.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 5\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nSince we will be working with sensitive personal data that will only be anonymised at the end of\nthe project, the data will be stored in the university's secure environment for private data. During\nthe fieldwork it is possible that, in case of lack of internet connection, data will be temporarily\nstored in my personal computer (encrypted through BitLocker and PIN password authentication).\nThey will be backed-up in my personal hard disk on the KU Leuven network (I: disk) as soon as\nInternet connection will be available.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic daily back-up\nprocedures.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nSince the volume of data is relatively small, no costs are expected. Should expenses for storage\nof data arise, they will be covered through grant funds.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nSince we will be working with sensitive personal data that will only be anonymised at the end of\nthe project, the data will be stored in the university's secure environment for private data.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nThe only reason for which I will deviate from the principle of preservation of data will be the\nwithdrawal of research respondents from the participation into the research and their request to\ndelete all related personal data, as provided in the informed consent form. I will be responsible\nfor handling this process for 5 years after the end of the research project.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nFor 5 years after the end of the research, data will be stored on the Microsoft OneDrive data\ncloud of the KU Leuven, which is a very secure cloud-based data storage space. \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nThere are no expected costs due to the relatively small volume of data. \n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nYes. Specify:\nInformed consent forms signed by research participants will explicitly state that data will only be\navailable to the PI, no third party will be able to access data in which participants are\nrecognisable.\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 5\nResearch publications may contain strictly anonymized parts of the data, in the form of direct or\nindirect quotes, descriptions of human interactions in observed situations, or descriptions of the\naudio/video/written contents generated by participants themselves. Participants will be aware of\nthis through the information provided in the consent form.\nCollected data will not be publicly available in any other form apart such publications, and will\nnot be part of any open data initiatives.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nData will not be available for reuse, according to the specific conditions of the informed consent\nsigned by research participants.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nMy promotor prof.
