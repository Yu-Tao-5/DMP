Hence, the general aim of this project is to address this need by\ndeveloping a holistic model of media-effects within and on familial interactions based on the family system approach. To this end, this project will\nemploy a multi-method approach consisting of an extensive qualitative study to gain in-depth insight in the various ways digital media are used within\nfamilies, and a two-wave ESM study to determine how such use positively and negatively affects the family system on both short- and long-term\noutcomes.\nThis project addresses four important gaps in current family and media research: 1) it goes beyond individualistic perspectives by simultaneously\nincluding several family members and their mutual interactions, 2) with attention to both positive (i.e., strengthening) and negative (i.e., interfering)\noutcomes, and concurrently 3) taking into account the diversity in what ‘being a family’ means as well as 4) the dynamic nature of media use.

All data transformations and analyses performed on these datasets will be explained in a document and stored in a safe folder. To manage and organize our references, we will use the reference manager Zotero. Zotero will help us to collect, organize, cite, and share research sources, thereby improving the traceability and reproducibility of our work. For each work package, a preregistration will be documented. Created using DMPonline.be.

Yes How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? First of all, all files can only be accessed with a Multifactor Authentication of the doctoral researcher's KU Leuven account. To further prevent unauthorized access or modification, personal data will be pseudonymised before being stored in the research unit's storage. Any non- pseudonymised personal data will be securely stored on the researchers' OneDrive, where access is limited. Furthermore, our data management protocols will be subjected to review during the ethical application process via PRET for SMEC approval, ensuring stringent ethical and security measures are in place. In case of interviews, the audio record will be deleted once the interview of that participant has been fully transcribed.

What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? OneDrive for Business is free for staff and students of KU Leuven. There are no additional costs for this project. The I- and J-drive can be accessed for this project, as the costs are covered by the overall research group. 4.

Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) Only the baseline questionnaire (WP1 and WP2), and the ESM survey (WP2) will be put on OSF with an embargo after pseudonymization and on RDR.

If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Scientific researchers will have to motivate why they want access to the data: What topic are you studying? How is the data linked to your research domain? Why do you think you need this data? Which question/problem will the data help with? What do you expect the data to provide you with? We will always ask to give credit to the original data creators when the data it is being used by other researchers.
