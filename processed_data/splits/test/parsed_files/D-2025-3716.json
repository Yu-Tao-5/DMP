This combined effort will reach unprecedented sensitivity, precision and accuracy to\ndetermine the shape observables (charge radii, electric quadrupole moments) and compare them to state-of-the-art nuclear models\n(spherical shell model, density functional theory, ab initio models based on chiral effective field theory). This programme will combine\ndifferent techniques at various accelerator facilities where I employ and develop unique approaches and instrumentation: - At CERN\nISOLDE (Geneva, CH), high-resolution laser resonance ionization spectroscopy will be performed with the Resonant Ionization Laser Ion\nSource (RILIS) combined with the Perpendicularly-Illuminated Laser Ion Source and Trap (PI-LIST) to study the onset of octupole\ndeformation and proceed towards the proton drip line with selected nuclei. - At GANIL SPIRAL2 (Caen, FR), high-sensitivity laser\nresonance ionization spectroscopy will be performed in the supersonic gas jet of the gas cell at the focal plane of the Super Separator\nSpectrometer (S3) to study the most exotic isotopes not available at ISOLDE, reaching proton-unbound nuclei at the drip line. - At PSI\n(Villigen, CH), muonic x-ray spectroscopy will be performed on key isotopes to measure absolute charge radii that are crucial to complete\nthe analysis of the NSHAPE isotopes. This work will combine a strong experimental development in target production for muX, in the\ndetector array, and in the analysis tools. Combining the high-resolution laser spectroscopy and the high-accuracy from \nμ\nx-ray\nspectroscopy is a unique programme that only NSHAPE can fully realise, providing radii and moments with unprecedented accuracy.\nFrom those results, I shall obtain a deeper understanding of the strong interaction at work in the nuclear medium.\nID: \nID: \n209045\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-04-2023\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n31-03-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n15-01-2025\nGrant number / URL: \nGrant number / URL: \n​101088504\n​\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

The metadata on those targets\ninclude the data sheet of the different components (substrate, ingredients) and the production protocol.

A digital logbook is maintained with the needed\nmetadata.
