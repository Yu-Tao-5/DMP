To produce materials and chemicals from lignocellulosic\nbiomass, sustainable, energy-friendly\nand resource efficient conversion routes are needed. Wood-eating beetles are natural biorefineries for lignocellulosic biomass driven by\nhost-gut microbiome interactions and enable them to feed on nutrient-poor diets and digestion of recalcitrant molecules. Our aim is to\nengineer lignocellulolytic microbiomes from wood-eating beetles for biorefinement platforms to produce value-added biochemicals from\nresidual biomass. Microbiome functioning and lignocellulose bioconversion\nwill be studied in vivo in the digestive tract of wood-eating beetles with careful consideration of gut physiology and physiochemistry.\nEspecially, lignin deconstruction is elucidated in-depth to map the formation of lignin derivatives to resolve inhibitory effects in anaerobic\ndigesters and identify value-added aromatic biochemicals. Based on in vivo conditions, gut microbiome cultivation will be\nfurther optimized in microbioreactor arrays in vitro to finally be able to mimic lignocellulose bioconversion in a multistage bioreactor. The\nmicrobiome in the multistage bioreactor will be subsequently engineered for the production of value-added biochemicals such as\ncarboxylates and lignin-derived aromatics.\nLast modified: \n05-02-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
