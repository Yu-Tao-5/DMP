In 1 out of 10 patients, ALS is a familial disease and in\nthe majority of these cases a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in a non-coding region\nof the C9orf72 gene is responsible for the disease (C9-ALS patients). We have\nestablished a transient zebrafish model for this form of ALS and published data\nstrongly indicating that RNA toxicity (induced by the hexanucleotide repeat containing\nRNA) plays an important role in this ALS model. Preliminary data also indicate that we\ncan counteract this RNA toxicity by co-expression of different RNA-binding proteins.\nThe aim of this proposal is to further characterize this protective effect and to\ninvestigate the underlying molecular mechanism using both a transient and a stable\nzebrafish model. In addition, we will use motor neurons obtained from induced\npluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from C9-ALS patients. In a second part, we will\ncheck whether the presence of the repeats has an effect on the expression of the RNA-\nbinding proteins using the different models as well as post-mortem material of C9-ALS\npatients. Overall, we will get a better insight into the role of RNA-binding proteins in\nALS, which could lead to new therapeutic targets.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
