GENERAL INFORMATION  \nName applicant  \nChristine Desmedt  \n \nFWO Project Number & Title  \nG082524N  \nAtlas of therapeutic targets in metastatic breast cancer.  \n \nAffiliation  \nKU Leuven  \n \n2. DATA DESCRIPTION  \nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?  \nIt will be a combination of both. In UPTIDER (S64410, EC approved on the 30th of November 2020) breast \ncancer patients are participating to our post -mortem tissue donation program. We are retrospectively \ncollecting clinical health data and some diagnostic archived bio material and upon the death of the \npatients, during the autopsy,  we are collecting new biological samples from which new data will be \nderived.  \n \nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. This \nmay be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and per WP or objective of the project. If you \nDMP  FWO G082524N  LTBCR  \n2 \nV1.0 (based on documentation from th e DMP dept.)  reuse existing data, specify the source of these data.  Distinguish data types (the kind of content) from \ndata formats (the technical format).  \nPlease see table 1 below.  \nIn general within the project:  \n- An electronic case report form (eCRF) data base, using the in -house REDCap available system, has been  \nbuilt by our laboratory in order to collect available patient’s data from UZ Leuven data base (collected \nfrom the local patient’s file) as well as data specifically retrieved for the study. The patient’s data include \ndemographic, pathological, clinical, t reatment and outcome data. Data collected are in line with the GCP \nand GDPR requirements.  \n- Sample’s data are collected within a lab management system called “lab collector”. Data collected are in \nline with the UZ/KU Leuven biobank requirements.  \n- With r egards to the prospective biological material collection, we will generate new data including \nhistological  and immunohistological  measurements. In addition immune soluble markers will be assessed \nin the blood.  \n- In addition, shallow whole genome DNA seque ncing ( sWGS) , whole exome sequencing (WES) and bulk \nRNA sequencing  data will be generated.  \nRaw as well as processed data will be submitted to a public repository in the below  described standard \nformats, to enable sharing and long -term validity of the data.  \nData type  N° of cases  Data Source  Data content  Data Format  Volume (Go)  \nClinical/ sample Data  30 patients \n(median of 32 \nsamples per \npatient)  Patient file  demographic, \npathological, \nclinical, \ntreatment and \noutcome data  eCRF and lab \ncollector  0.5 \nHisto(immunological) \ndata   ~1000   Generated   Markers score  Excel file and \nimages  2.5 \nSoluble markers  30  Generated   Markers score   Text file  300 \nBulk RNA seq   ~1000  HiSeq 4000  Gene expression  .fastq, bam  2.5 \nSWGS   ~1000  HiSeq 4000  Genomic profile  .fastq, bam  1 \nWES   ~1000  HiSeq 4000  Genomic profile  .fastq, bam  10 \nTable1: Data Description  \n \n3. LEGAL AND ETHICAL ISSUES  \nWill you use personal data?  If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add the \nreference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for Research and Public Service \nDMP  FWO G082524N  LTBCR  \n3 \nV1.0 (based on documentation from th e DMP dept.)  Purposes (PRET application).   Be aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal \nobligation.  \nYes, we will use personal data. Data  include demographic (age, gender), pathological, clinical, treatment \nand outcome data . At the time of UPTIDER  project proposal we were not asked to fill in a PRET application \n(the project was set -up before the applicat ion was up and running and mandatory) however a GDPR form \nwas filled in at the time.  \n \nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans \nor animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal app roval by the relevant ethical review \ncommittee(s)  \nThe UPTIDER  project was approved by the EC UZ/KU Leuven  S64410.  \n \nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? Will \nIP restrictions be claimed for the d ata you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions will be \nasserted?  \nThere is potential tech transfer/valorization in the putative assays/biomarkers we measure or we aim to \ndiscover. We are working with the Leuven Research and Development depart ment ( LRD) and it is involved \nin all the Material Transfer Agreements and Data Transfer Agreements ( MTA/DTAs ) we have set -up in the \ncontext of this project.  \n \nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If so, \nto what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?  \nWe are working with the LRD and LRD is involved in all the MTA/DTAs we have set -up in the context of \nthis project. There is no specific restriction.  \n \n4. DOCUMENTATION AND METADATA  \nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this project?  \nAll collected clinical data are stored either in  an eCRF (R EDCap).  In REDCap, the documentation is \nautomatically provided though  the auto generated dictionary and code book where all the requested data \nare described.  All collected data belonging to the sample collection are stored in an online lab \nmanagement system called Lab Collector.  \nDMP  FWO G082524N  LTBCR  \n4 \nV1.0 (based on documentation from th e DMP dept.)   \nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, de scribe in detail which standard will be used.  If no, state in \ndetail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse.  \nA description tab is systematically added to the documentation in order to explain the header of the data \ncollection sheets.  \n5. DATA STORAGE AND BACKUP DURING THE FWO PROJECT  \nWhere will the data be stored?  \nThe data will be stored on the KU Leuven server s. All systems  but Lab Collector  run on a secured and \nbacked up server of KULeuven (managed by ICT of the Bi omedical Sciences Group). These systems also \nprovide a logging system so no data can ever be erased, making that everything will be traceable and \nstored long -term (well  beyond the common 5 -year requirement).  Lab Collector data base is externally and \nprofes sionally managed by the company “AgileBio”.  \n \nHow is backup of the data provided?  \nThe hosting KUL server is automatically backed up using KUL services , multiple times per day . Concerning \nLabCollector, backups are automatically performed twice a day.  \n \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no \nor insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain  how this will be taken care of.  \nThere is sufficient storage and back -up capacity on all KU Leuven servers:  \n- the “L -drive” is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster \nwith NetApp series storage systems, and a CTDB s amba cluster in the front -end.  \n- the Staging and Archive on VSC are also sufficiently scalable (petabyte scale) . \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these costs be \ncovered?  \nThe total estimated cost of data  storage during the project is 19200 EUR. This estimation is based on the \nfollowing costs:  \n- 8400 EUR for storage on the L -drive of 15000  Go at 700 EUR/ 5000Go /year over the total duration \nof the project (4 years)  \nDMP  FWO G082524N  LTBCR  \n5 \nV1.0 (based on documentation from th e DMP dept.)  - 10800  EUR for storage on the VSC cluster of 4500  Go at 0.6 EUR/Go/year for active data over the \ntotal duration of the project (4 years)  \nBudget for compute and data storage is budgeted for in ongoing projects (ERC and C1 granted proposals).  \n \nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by \nunauthorized persons?  \nOur eCRF, our lab management system (Lab Collector), and the network drive dedicated to the team (L -\ndrive) are  password access -protected b y users, with person -based decision on rights to access and modify \ndata. Moreover, this is the same for the  VSC secured storage which is only accessible to VSC accounts, and \nspecifically our volume will only be accessible to group members.  \n \n6. DATA PRESERVATION AFTER THE FWO PROJECT  \nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 -year period after the end of the project? In case only a \nselection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual \nrestrictions, p hysical preservation issues, ...).  \nThe minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied  to all datasets. \nBiological samples obtained under research agreement  will be kept  according to the EC licenses and \nagreements. In effe ct, consent is obtained to store  the samples for the specific research purposes \nstipulated in the informed consent.  Putative remnant clinical/patient samples are stored in the UZ Leuven \nbiobank.  \n \nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?  \nAs a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that \nsupport FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of publication or preprint \ndeposition . \nFor all other datasets , long term storage will be ensured as follows:  \n- Large sequencing/omics data: will be stored on “L-drive”.  \n- Small digital files: files will be stored on the “L -drive”.  \n- Developed algorithms and software will be stored on L -drive, as well on public repositor ies such \nas framagit.com and codeocean.com .  \n- Clinical and sample data will be stored in our lab management tools (eCRF and Lab Collector).  \nDMP  FWO G082524N  LTBCR  \n6 \nV1.0 (based on documentation from th e DMP dept.)  Third -party software and algorithms that are used are referenced by their version numbers in our method \nsection and a re installed as modules on the VSC and/or containers (Docker, Singularity) on the VSC, to \nensure reproducibility . \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the \ncosts be covered?  \nThe total estimated  cost of data storage during the 5 years after the end of the project is 19200  EUR. This \nestimation is based on the total given in Table 1 and the cost of storage on the L -Drive  \n(700EUR /5000 Go/year)  and on the VSC cluster  0.6 EUR/Go/year . The cost will be covered by the \nlaboratory budget.  \n \n7. DATA SHARING AND REUSE  \nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an \nagreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?  \nPersonal data will only be published after de -identification and identifiers will not be publish ed. \n \nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?  \nWe are committed to publish research results to communicate them to peers and to a wide audience. All \nresearch outputs supporting publications will be made openly accessible. Depending on their nature, \nsome data may be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested \nresearchers and/or potential new collaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. negative data).  MTA and \nor DTA have been set -up in this sense and will be set -up if needed.  \n \nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?  \nIn an Open Access repository . \nUpon publication, all anonymized patient details supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available \nas supplemental inform ation.  \nOmics datasets will be deposited in open access repositories such the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus \n(GEO)  or The European Genome -phenome Archive (EGA) . All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software \ncode driving the project will be stored in a private online git repository of the  laboratory . As soon as the \nmanuscript is publicly available, the repository will be changed to a public repository.  \nDMP  FWO G082524N  LTBCR  \n7 \nV1.0 (based on documentation from th e DMP dept.)   \nWhen will the data be made available?  \nUpon publication . \n \nWho will be able to access the data and under  what conditions?  \nWhenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through \nrepositories that support FAIR data sharing . \nMoreover, as mentioned above MTA and or DTA have been set -up and will be set -up if needed.  \n \nWha t are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?   \nIt is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard  procedures e.g. for \nmetadata collection and file storage and organization from the start  of the proje ct, and by using free -to-\nuse data repositories and dissemination facilities  whenever possible.  \nData management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget.  \n \n8. RESPONSIBILITIES  \nWho will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?  \nMetadata will be documented by the  senior post -doc, research manager, PhD students  and technical staff \nat the time of  data collection and analysis . \n \nWho will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?  \nThe senior post -doc, research manager and technical staff will ensure data storage and back up, with \nsupport from ICTS, gbiomed -IT staff, and UZ -IT staff.  \n \nWho will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse?  \nThe PI is responsible for data preservation and sharing, with support from the team, ICTS, gbiomed -IT \nstaff, and UZ -IT staff.  \n \nWho bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?  \nThe PI is ultimately responsible for all data management d uring and after data collection, including \nimplementing and updating the DMP.
