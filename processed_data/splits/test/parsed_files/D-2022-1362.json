These existential\nconcerns are referred to as the unavoidable issues of human existence, such as lifeâ€™s finality,\nthe meaning of oneâ€™s life, the freedom and responsibility one has in life, the fundamental\nexistential isolation and search for connectedness (Yalom, 1980). Working with clientsâ€™\nexistential concerns in therapy is gaining importance in the psychotherapy research literature\nsince studies have shown that existential worries can be identified as trans-diagnostic factors\n(e.g. Iverach et al., 2014) and that working with these concerns in therapy could foster better\ntherapy outcomes (Dewitte, et al. 2019; Dezutter et al., 2014; Hill, 2017). \nThis project scrutinizes\nexistential empathy as a possible therapist variable and contributor to therapeutic change,\nexamines the attitudes and skills that enable existential empathy, and studies the impact of\nexistential training on existential empathy. The overall aim of this project is to increase\nexistential empathy in psychotherapists in order to make psychotherapy and psychological\ninterventions more effective. This project also opens the door to study existential empathy in\nhealth care workers in general (e.g. doctors, nurses,â€¦) in order to help them attune to the\nexistential concerns of patients in any health care setting.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
