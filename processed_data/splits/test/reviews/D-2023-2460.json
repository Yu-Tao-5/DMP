For your future DMPs, please use the Flemish standard DMP template that is now used by all Flemish funders (FWO, BOF/IOF and VLAIO), this is very similar to the one you used. You can find this template in DMPonline.be and on the FWO website (www.fwo.be/en/the-fwo/research-policy/data-management-plan/)\nStorage/preservation: please clarify which cloud storage you will use, note that cloud storage is usually not very suitable for long term storage, these may be  linked to a user account and you may lose data when researchers leave. Consult the storage guide to compare solutions that KU Leuven ICTS offers: https://icts.kuleuven.be/storagewijzer/en. Also note that KU Leuven policy asks to store all relevant data for 10 years, see https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/policy\nSharing: note that scientific data is a data journal, not a data repository. You can use a repository such as KU Leuven RDR where you can share your data and in addition your data is securely preserved for 10 years without additional costs, for more information see: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr and https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/data-sharing",
