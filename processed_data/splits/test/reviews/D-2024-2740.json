  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "29/02/2024\r\nA lot of questions appear to be missing from the DMP. Probably because you unselected optional plan components \"unanswered questions\" when downloading the plan from DMPOnline? All the questions need to be in the DMP so it is best do download the plan again and select \"unanswered questions\" and then check if all the questions are in the DMP.\n\n1) Data description: Very clear data table! Also include the PRET application number for the ethics & personal data sections\n3) Data storage: Enable Multifactor Authentication for your KU Leuven account (https://admin.kuleuven.be/icts/services/mfa) and consider encrypting the folder with the personal identifiers (https://admin.kuleuven.be/icts/onderzoek/datamgmtpract/ape/encypteren)\n4) Data preservation: Where will you preserve the relevant data for 10 years? On the shared drive of the research group? Good to mention that the pseudonymized survey data will be put in restricted access on OSF, but also think about where you will preserve (the rest of) the data in long term storage infrastructure at KU Leuven\n5) Data sharing: the license section is confusing. Please note that a CC BY license is only for open available data. The custom KU Leuven license is only for data that are deposited on the KU Leuven Research data repository and you will deposit the data on OSF? You can of course consider to deposit the data on RDR as it has many benefits: it is free for KU Leuven researchers and you receive support from KU Leuven staff, you can add metadata and keywords to your data that are findable even when the dataset is in restricted access, the data is safely preserved on KU Leuven servers, you can put the pseudonymized data in restricted access with a KU Leuven license and when researchers (or others) request access to your data you can set up a data sharing agreement with the help of the KU Leuven Juridische Dienst.
