Data: are you generating any data, code/scripts/spss/stata files? \n3: Personal data and ethics: It is stated that no personal data will be used and that the microdata are anonymous social survey data. Can you confirm that the data are truly anonymous? It is not sufficient that you as a researcher cannot identify the survey participants. Please note that even if the direct identifiers have been removed, these might still be personal data. Please have a look at https://admin.kuleuven.be/privacy/en/studpers/researchers#section-8 for the difference between pseudonymized and anonymized data. All processing of personal data at KU Leuven needs to undergo a privacy review. More information on this procedure can be found at https://admin.kuleuven.be/privacy/en/studpers/index.\nAll 3 microdata (MEqIn, LISS, PSID) seem to have some kind of procedure to request access to the data. This suggests there has to be signed an agreement related to confidentiality and privacy. Do these agreements mention the privacy ‘status’ of the data?\nFinally, please note that some of the restricted PSID datasets require an IRB approval before the dataset can be requested. Is this applicable in this research project?\n5. Storage: Please note that onedrive is a cloud service, data is stored externally on Microsoft servers, not on KU leuven servers. Only use dropbox if you have a for business account and for non-confidential files, free dropbox is not secure, see also: https://icts.kuleuven.be/sc/english/storage/onedrive\n7. Sharing: KU Leuven now has a data repository that you can consider to use to share your data, see www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr",
