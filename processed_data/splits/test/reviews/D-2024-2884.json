I have a few remarks, but these can be adressed when writing the next version of the dmp, either the intermediary or the final one.\n- In the data summary table it is best to use the extension for the digital data format instead of ASCII, such as .txt or .csv.\n- Cost for storage in the long term: if you are talking about uploading Terabytes to a repository, then cost might become more important. Both Zenodo and RDR put limits on the size of datasets, but it is possible to negotiate about larger datasets.\n- Data sharing:\no\tWhen requested by a publisher data will be shared through an open repository, otherwise on demand after approval or access will be limited in other ways. In that case we advise to answer the next question about who will get access, at least by referring to your answer on where the data will be shared.\no\tCC-BY 4.0 only makes sense for data shared openly. For data shared on request and after approval this licence would defeat the purpose of that policy because it allows to distribute the data to others without your consent. A data transfer agreement (DTA) is then more appropriate.\n\nMark Verbrugge",
