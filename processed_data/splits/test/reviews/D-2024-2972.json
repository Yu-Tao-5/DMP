You can find this template in DMPonline.be, or on the FWO website with more information about their DMP requirements (https://www.fwo.be/en/about-fwo/research-policy/data-management-plan-dmp/). You can copy paste most of the information from the current DMP but there will be some additional questions mainly about data sharing.",
