Just one suggestion:\n2.1 Findable data: since you will deposit the ASAP generated datasets in Zenodo as indicated in 2.2 (the EC indeed expects all generated research data to be deposited in a data repository), in Zenodo the datasets will obtain a DOI and discovery metadata will be added there too.",
