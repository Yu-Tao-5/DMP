If you are looking for cloud storage KU Leuven onedrive with multi-factor authentication is already more secure but even better to use cloud storage for non-sensitive data only and use the KU Leuven servers (I or J) drive for sensitive personal data. Take a look at the storage guide (https://icts.kuleuven.be/storagewijzer/en) or contact your local IT team for more information. \nFor sharing you can use KU Leuven RDR, if you can't fully anonymize your data you can also restrict access to the files www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr.",
