You could make use of the KU Leuven RDR (Research Data Repository): https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr to preserve your data for the 10 years and to also make them visible / available for future reuse. The repository has the option to restrict access to the data files, so a researcher interested in using the data has to first request access to you. You can then allow access on a case-by-case basis. This can be a good solution for both questionnaire data and interview transcripts. For the latter GDPR compliant data sharing agreements can drawn up.",
