As with other women in\nthe history of church and theology, their role is, however, often overlooked. This research focusing on the historical identity formation of the JMJ\nsisters and the centrality of the empowerment of women and girls herein will trace (i) the lived experiences of the sisters of Jesus Mary Joseph (JMJ)\nfrom the Netherlands and Australia who traveled to India in 1904 and 1920; (ii) the native women who joined them as Handmaids of Mary; and (iii)\nthe administration shift from Dutch heritage to Indian inculturation up to the 1960s. The voices and stories of these religious women are generally\nunknown, and their experiences and identities have not been properly documented. Through textual analysis, archival research, and oral history, this\nproject will evaluate, hear from, and report on these missionary women and thus contribute to the ongoing work of the empowerment of women in\nIndia.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n28-02-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

When applicable, the filename will conclude with the initials of the creator. README files will be employed to provide comprehensive descriptions of the data, categorized as archival, interviews, or images. The structure of these README files will include various identifiers such as title, year, location, author/creator, file type, and key words, contributing to a well-organized and accessible documentation system.
