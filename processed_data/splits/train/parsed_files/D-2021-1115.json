More\nspecifically, it focusses on the development of a MYSQL database that will make it possible to\nstudy the circulation of Belgian art in relation to the international market, cultural diplomacy and\nother international cultural circuits. The datamodel that is based on the data present in\nexhibition catalogues, is designed in such a way that it can be used for other research projects\nthat look into the international circulation of modern art. Through the database, the research\nproject sheds light on numerous artists who are unknown today and/or are considered less\nimportant: what did they mean in the international circuit? And in a particular country or region?\nOr in relation to a specific social artistic network? And what was the role of international dealers,\ndiplomats, consuls and collectors? Although the database is still in a test phase, forty-two female\nartists have already been identified. The aim of the project is not so much to reposition artists or\nto elevate their status, but to shed new light on their work and canonisation mechanisms, and to\nhighlight a less studied institutional aspect of modern art history that brings together artistic,\neconomic and political actors. In addition, the database and research results will also be used in\nthe reassessment of modern art and the representation of modern art collections.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
