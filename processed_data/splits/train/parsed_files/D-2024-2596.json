Yes, human subject data and/or personal data In this study, 3 data subsets will be collected. First, the quantitative data involves data collected via the wearables (subset 1) and via smartphone or an online platform Subjective User feedback (subset 2). These data are anonymous, since they cannot be linked to individual participants. To do so, a study email addresses will be created by the researchers and will be randomly distributed to participants. These email Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 27 May 2024 4 of 10 addresses will then be used to create dummy wearable and platform accounts, all using the same ‘fake’ personal data, namely male gender, height of 170 cm and weight of 70 kg. In addition, the same email addresses and accompanying ID codes are used to collect research data in the smartphone app and platform data. Wearable and smartphone data are automatically uploaded onto the data collection platform (created by the Belgian company). In addition, as only anonymous data is collected on the platform, no personal data is shared with this company. A programmer from the platform's owner could view the data but cannot link it to an existing person. The questionnaires and qualitative data subsets are collected via the online and GDPR compliant survey program Questionpro. The questionnaires and qualitative data that will be collected include socio-demographic information (e.g., age and gender), information related to feasibility and acceptability of the StressTRACS application. Data collected via Questionpro is only available to the StressTRACS project researchers and is password-protected through the accounts of the individual researchers.

Explain in the comment section. In a cloud service offered by Thomas More (Microsoft 365: SharePoint) In an external cloud service As part of the StressTRACS project there is a need for a data platform to collect, process and visualise the project data. The contractor will set up a platform that can collect, process, and display data from the subjects for the duration of the project. The data come from commercially available activity trackers (wearables) on the one hand, and data from questionnaires that will be offered to users via the platform and accompanying smartphone application on the other. The data will be processed by the algorithms that the researchers of the StressTRACS project will develop, which will provide additional information to be displayed to the user. The data from the wearables and from the subjective data filled in by the participants in the smartphone app will also be stored in a regresql database hosted on a kubernetes cluster managed and hosted by Thomas More Mobilab & Care. The data platform provides the posibility to download all data. These downloads will then be stored on Thomas More Microsoft 365 SharePoint (StressTRACS). How will the data be How will the data be backed up backed up ? ? Data will be backed up using cloud service offered by Thomas More (Microsoft 365: SharePoint/OneDrive/Teams). These cloud services take automatic backups. The StressTRACS data platform to collect, process and visualise the project data includes regular back-ups of the data.
