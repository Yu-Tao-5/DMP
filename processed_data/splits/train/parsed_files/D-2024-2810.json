In this case, IP will \n(i) not be shared, (ii) put under embargo, or (iii) a suitable license will be applied to the data when published \n(e.g. Creative Commons License).  \n \n \n \n \n3. Documentation and Metadata  \n \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        9 \n Clearly describe what approach will be followed \nto capture the accompanying information \nnecessary to keep data understandable and \nusable , for yourself and others, now and in the \nfuture (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and \ntypes required, procedures u sed, Electronic Lab \nNotebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. \nwhere this information is recorded ). \n \nRDM guidance on documentation and metadata . \n The Biosensors group uses the electronic lab notebook in which a number of predetermined  topics have to \nbe described for each experiment (objective, protocol, results, and conclusion). The electronic lab \nnotebook facilitates searching for particular metadata through a search engine. By mimicking the folder \nstructure of the electronic lab note book in the server -based folder with the experimental data, linking of \nthe metadata to the actual data will be facilitated.  \n \nAs a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that \nsupport FAIR data sharin g (www.fairsharing.org). When depositing data in a local or public repository, the \nfinal dataset will be accompanied by this information in a README.txt document, following the Dublin \nCore Metadata standard if no other meta -standard is available yet.  \n \nThis file will be located in the top -level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other \nfiles and outline the filenaming convention used. This will allow the data to be understood by other \nmembers of the laboratory and add contextual v alue to the dataset for future reuse. For each peer -\nreviewed article, a separate folder will be made on the server, containing the latest Word version and all \nraw and processed data used in the article. In addition, a separate file will be made in the elec tronic lab \nnotebook for each article, containing clickable links to all metadata files of data that were used in that \nparticular article, to facilitate tracing back of protocols, results and conclusions.  \n \nWill a metadata standard be used to make it \neasier  to find and reuse the data ?  \n \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard \nwill be used. If not, please specify which \nmetadata will be created to make the data \neasier to find and reuse.  \n \nREPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN \nFORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. \nSTANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . \n ☒ Yes \n☐ No \nIf yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata  standard  will be used :  \n \nTo guarantee reusable aspect of data, sufficient documentation and methods information will be \nprovided, whereas CC -BY license will be attached to data through data repositories.  \n \nIf no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created:  \n \n \n \n \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        10 \n  \n4.

If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities  are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.  ☒ Yes \n☐ No \n \nIf no, please specify : During, as well as after the project, KU Leuven can provide sufficient storage and \nbackup capacity. A dedicated folder is made for the project to store data files . \n \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        11 \n How will you ensure that the data are securely \nstored and not accessed or modified by \nunauthorized persons?  \n \nCLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , \nNETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND \nFILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND \nTRANSFE RRED DATA ARE SAFE .  \nGuidance on security for research data   \n  \nThe network drive for the project shared folder and the large volume storage folder are secured by the \nICTS service of KU Leuven with a mirror copy. Confidential data can and will be protected with a password \n(available only for PI Jeroen Lammertyn). Visitors, MSc thesis students and internship students in the \ngroups as well as other unau thorized persons will not have access to the data on the shared folder. Data \nstorage in the cloud will be avoided, unless for temporary use only, e.g., to transfer large files between the \nresearchers involved in the project.  \n \n \n \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?  Type 1 server back -end storage with mirror backup for the project shared folder will be used. Using the  \nshared network  drive  (J-drive) and large volume  storage (K -drive) cost  respectively 503.66 Euro per T B per \nyear and 104.42 Euro per T B per year . Costs will first be covered by the project consumables budget.  If \nadditional storage would  be required  for sequencing data , my co -promotor Prof. Voet has acquired a large -\nscale VLIR infrastructure grant to procure high -volume data storage as part of the Leuven Institute of Single -\nCell Omics (LISCO) which could be used for this project.  \n \n \n \n \n \n5. Data Preservation  after the en d of the Research P roject  \n \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        12 \n Which data will be retained for at least five \nyears (or longer, in agreement with other \nretention policies that are applicable) after the \nend of the  project? In case some data cannot be \npreserved , clearly state the reasons for this  \n(e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). \n Guidance on data preservation  ☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy  \n☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with \nmedicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans  \n☐ Certain data cannot be ke pt for 10 years (explain)  \n \n \n \n \nWhere will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long -term)?  \n \nDedicated data repositories  are often the best place \nto preserve your data . Data not suitable for \npreservation in a repository can be stored usi ng a KU \nLeuven storage solution, consult the  interactive  KU \nLeuven  storage guide . ☒ KU Leuven RDR  \n☒ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes)  \n☒ Shared network drive (J -drive)  \n☐ Other (specifiy):  \n \n \n \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during the expected retention \nperiod? How will these costs be covered?  \n \n • The volume corresponding to dissemination data is expected to be relatively low (<10 0 GB), and \ntherefore can be seamlessly embedded on the (K:) drive of KU Leuven. The costs (1000  EUR/year) \nwill be covered by other on -going projects at that point in time.  \n• For research data, at current archiving costs of 10 Euro/(TB*year), we estimate a cost of 2000  \nEuro/year. These costs will be covered by funding acquired by the project PIs in the context of \nother research projects.  \n• If additional storage would  be required for sequencing data, my co -promotor Prof. Voet has \nacquired a large -scale VLIR infrastructur e grant to procure high -volume data storage as part of the \nLeuven Institute of Single -Cell Omics (LISCO) which could be used for this project.  \n \n \n6.

It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all materials tha t need proper management because they are valuable, diffic ult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentatio n/metadata. RDM Guidance on data If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type . / 3 Add rows for each dataset you want to describe. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 7 Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when app ropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number . ☒ Yes, human subject data ; provide SMEC or EC a pproval number: ☐ Yes, animal data ; provide ECD reference number: ☐ Yes, dual use; provide approva l number : ☐ No Additional information : Human samples will be used: commercially available induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs), in which chromosomal instability is induced (by reversine pulse) to obtain aneuploid IPSCS. The ethical approval for these cells will be obtained before they will be used, which is expected in the fourth year of the FWO -SB project. Will you process personal data4? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number). ☒ Yes (provide PRET G -number or EC S -number below) ☐ No Additional information: Sequencing data of the above described human cell lines will be generated. The privacy register number for this data will be obtained befor e the sequencing data is obtained, which is expected in the fourth year of the FWO -SB project. Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer , for example spin- offs, commercial exploitation, … )? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate . ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes , please comment : If research data have potential for patent filing, scientific staff working on this project will discuss this with the IOF manager in the group and LRD to make sure that data are protected prior to publications. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements , research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 8 Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please explain: Due to the generation of IP, restrictions in data sharing might potentially be implemented. This will be followed up through regular meetings with KU Leuven LRD, who will evaluate and protect potential IP generated during the project that could lead to va lorization actions. In this case, IP will (i) not be shared, (ii) put under embargo, or (iii) a suitable license will be applied to the data when published (e.g. Creative Commons License). 3. Documentation and Metadata FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9 Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures u sed, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata . The Biosensors group uses the electronic lab notebook in which a number of predetermined topics have to be described for each experiment (objective, protocol, results, and conclusion). The electronic lab notebook facilitates searching for particular metadata through a search engine. By mimicking the folder structure of the electronic lab note book in the server -based folder with the experimental data, linking of the metadata to the actual data will be facilitated. As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharin g (www.fairsharing.org). When depositing data in a local or public repository, the final dataset will be accompanied by this information in a README.txt document, following the Dublin Core Metadata standard if no other meta -standard is available yet. This file will be located in the top -level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the filenaming convention used. This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual v alue to the dataset for future reuse. For each peer - reviewed article, a separate folder will be made on the server, containing the latest Word version and all raw and processed data used in the article. In addition, a separate file will be made in the elec tronic lab notebook for each article, containing clickable links to all metadata files of data that were used in that particular article, to facilitate tracing back of protocols, results and conclusions. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : To guarantee reusable aspect of data, sufficient documentation and methods information will be provided, whereas CC -BY license will be attached to data through data repositories. If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data. ☒ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I -drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☒ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on -premis ☒ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☐ Other: How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? ☒ Standard back -up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back -ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If no, please specify : During, as well as after the project, KU Leuven can provide sufficient storage and backup capacity. A dedicated folder is made for the project to store data files . FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11 How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFE RRED DATA ARE SAFE . Guidance on security for research data The network drive for the project shared folder and the large volume storage folder are secured by the ICTS service of KU Leuven with a mirror copy. Confidential data can and will be protected with a password (available only for PI Jeroen Lammertyn). Visitors, MSc thesis students and internship students in the groups as well as other unau thorized persons will not have access to the data on the shared folder. Data storage in the cloud will be avoided, unless for temporary use only, e.g., to transfer large files between the researchers involved in the project. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Type 1 server back -end storage with mirror backup for the project shared folder will be used. Using the shared network drive (J-drive) and large volume storage (K -drive) cost respectively 503.66 Euro per T B per year and 104.42 Euro per T B per year . Costs will first be covered by the project consumables budget. If additional storage would be required for sequencing data , my co -promotor Prof. Voet has acquired a large - scale VLIR infrastructure grant to procure high -volume data storage as part of the Leuven Institute of Single - Cell Omics (LISCO) which could be used for this project. 5. Data Preservation after the en d of the Research P roject FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12 Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). Guidance on data preservation ☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be ke pt for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data . Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored usi ng a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide . ☒ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☒ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? • The volume corresponding to dissemination data is expected to be relatively low (<10 0 GB), and therefore can be seamlessly embedded on the (K:) drive of KU Leuven. The costs (1000 EUR/year) will be covered by other on -going projects at that point in time. • For research data, at current archiving costs of 10 Euro/(TB*year), we estimate a cost of 2000 Euro/year. These costs will be covered by funding acquired by the project PIs in the context of other research projects. • If additional storage would be required for sequencing data, my co -promotor Prof. Voet has acquired a large -scale VLIR infrastructur e grant to procure high -volume data storage as part of the Leuven Institute of Single -Cell Omics (LISCO) which could be used for this project. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13 Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE ’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILA BLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY . AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS . FOR MORE INFORMATION : HTTPS ://WIKI.SURFNET .NL/DISPLAY /STANDARDS /INFO-EU- REPO /#INFOEUREPO -ACCESS RIGHTS ☒ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☐ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Only researchers participating in the project will be able to access the data for the duration of the p roject. As soon as the article associated with the data is ready for publication, the data will be made open through the institutional repositories mentioned in 2.1. The data will be deposited in the institutional repositories: (KU Leuven: Research Data Re pository (RDR) Research Data Repository (RDR) - RDR - Research Data Repository (kuleuven.be). Data will be assigned with DOIs to create trustworthy and persistent links for online content. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☒ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify : Before making data and other research output from the project (e.g. journal articles, book chapters and conference proceedings) openly available, they will b e aligned with the project IP strategy to avoid premature disclosure, which can compromise the patent filing application(s). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 14 Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. ☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Other data repository (specify) ☐ Other (specify) When will the data be made available? ☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS . IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED , THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED . DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DAT A UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT . Check the RDR guidance on licences for data and software sources code or consult the License selector tool to help you choose. ☒ CC-BY 4.0 (data) ☐ Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) ☐ MIT licence (code) ☐ GNU GPL -3.0 (code) ☐ Other (specify) Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here . INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA . ☒ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☐ No FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 15 What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? A restricted access repository can be implemented on a free tool, such as OneDrive, up to a certain volume. If this volume does not suffice, time -limited storage will be consi dered, thus limited to the time needed to download the data. The costs associated with data storage will be covered by the budget foreseen in the project agreement. 7.
