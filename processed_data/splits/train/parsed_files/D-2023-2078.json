However, recently it was shown that the exact functioning of these fillers is more\ncomplex than initially considered. It is believed that the acid generated during IP partially/fully degrades acid-sensitive fillers (e.g., ZIF-8) and that this\nstrongly influences film formation. Epoxide chemistry was recently proven to be an excellent platform for the development of novel nanofiltration\nmembranes, with good performance under harsh conditions. However, fundamental understanding of the relationship between process parameters and\nPEE film properties and membrane performance is still lacking due to the inherent complexity of the interfacial system. In - situ characterizing the\ninterfacial initiated polymerization (IIP) reaction can be a huge advantage. Therefore, fluorescence microscopy and microfluidic chips will be\ncombined as an in-situ characterization technique to study TFNs and epoxide-based membranes by conducting phase inversion, IP and IIP inside the\nchannels of microfluidic chips and selective probing with fluorescence molecules. \nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n10-02-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Files will be named according to a pre-agreed convention and will be accompanied by a README file which will describe the directory hierarchy and file naming convention. Each directory will contain an INFO.txt file describing the experimental protocol used. The used procedures will be written down in a word file. This way, the data can be understood by other team members and can be reused in the future. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data?

Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? All data will be stored electronically on the personal KU Leuven One Drive and/or KU Leuven J drive for daily back-up. For large and raw data files (microscopy video's) external hard drives will be used. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? The KU Leuven storage solutions like shared network drive (J-drive) and OneDrive make automatic back-ups. For data files too large for the shared drives (microscopy video's) an external hard drive will be used and backed-up monthly on another hard drive. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.

How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Shared network drive (J-drive) and the KU Leuven personal OneDrive are secured with password protection, which is changed every year. Access to these files will be restricted to members of the lab group who have been granted permission, with ICT permissions being limited to those who need it. Students, for example, will not be given access to sensitive data. The external hard drives are stored in a personal locker which can only be opened with a personal key. Furthermore, the BitLocker option is turned on, so the drive can only be unlocked with a password. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project?
