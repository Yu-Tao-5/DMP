The F WO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official  start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the \nresearch co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an element \nin the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel.  Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the \nfinal DMP may use this template.  \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation  Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives  of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions.  This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary  of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.  \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   2 \n 1.

In -house  interactomics identified an interaction of PSEN2 with an ER contact \nsite pro tein and with nutrient  sensing complexes, underscoring a yet unknown role for PSEN2 in inter -\norganellar communication  between LE/Lys and ER. I will combine state -of-the-art super -resolution imaging \nand spatial  interactomics to unravel the integral nano -environment of PSEN2 in LE/Lys -ER MCSs, with a  \nparticular attention to explore the functional connection with nutrient sensing and identify substrate  \ninvolvement. These outcomes will be validated in iPSC -derived neurons and microglia, with a focus  on how \nPSEN2 deficiency vs a familial AD causing mutation impact on endolysosomal homeostasis  through \nmodulating organellar communication, and this in both cell -autonomous and non  cell-autonomous  settings. \nThese novel insights will provide a better understanding on the etiology of  endolysosomal dysfunctions at \nearly, preclinical stages of AD.  \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   3 \n 2.

Results will be published in accordance with ethical guidelines set by the \nInternational Committee of Medical Journal Editors. Existing agreements between VIB and KU Leuven do \nnot restrict publication of data. We do not exclude that the proposed work could result in research data \nwith potential for t ech transfer and valorization. VIB has a policy to actively monitor research data for such \npotential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of \ncases the invention will be IP protected (mostly patent p rotection or copyright protection). As such, the IP \nprotection does not withhold the research data from being made public. In the case a decision is taken to \nfile a patent application, it will be planned so that publications are not delayed  \nDo existing 3r d party agreements restrict \nexploitation or dissemination of the data you \n(re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements , \nresearch  collaboration agreements)?  \nIf so, please explain to what data they relate and \nwhat restrictions are in place.  ☐ Yes \n☒ No \nIf yes, please explain:  \n \nAre there any other legal issues, such as \nintellectual property rights and ownership, to be \nmanaged related to the data you (re)use?  \nIf so, please explain to what data they relate and \nwhich restrictions will be asserted.  ☐ Yes \n☒ No \nIf yes, please explain:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   10 \n 3. Documentation and Metadata  \n \nClearly describe what approach will be followed \nto capture the accompanying information \nnecessary to keep data understandable and \nusable , for yourself and others, now and in the \nfuture (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and \ntypes required, procedures used, Electronic Lab \nNotebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. \nwhere this information is recorded ). Digital data will be stored on K U Leuven servers and will be made available together with the accompanying  \nmetadata,  at the latest at the time of publication. The principle of preservation of data and the minimum \npreservation term of 10 years after the end of the project will be applied without restriction , both  to raw \nand processed data. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed by e.g. pending publications, potential IP \nrequirements or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be made publicly \navailabl e as soon as the embargo date is reached.  \nAs detailed below, metadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse, \nand will be conform to community norms. Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will \nbe mad e publicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. These repositories clearly \ndescribe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public \nDomain Dedication or an ODC Public Domain Dedicatio n and License, with a material transfer agreement \nwhen applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit \nto the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. In this regard, plasmids can  be submitted \nto Addgene  (https://www.addgene.org/depositing/start -deposit/). For data shared directly by the PI, a \nmaterial transfer agreement (and a non -disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the \nbeneficiaries in order to clearly desc ribe the types of reuse that are permitted.  \nBefore the start of an experiment, suitable metadata standards will be checked at FAIR  sharing; using \nstandards as the Minimal Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations (MIBBI) and OME -TIFF for \nimages. The latter is used by the  local  OMERO platform.  \nIn particular, the following datasets will be stored:  \nDataset 2.1 – Research documentation  \nResearch documentation generated or collected from online sources (e.g. Pubmed ) and from collaborators, \nincludin g publications, tutorials, laboratory notes, protocols, animal husbandry data.  \nData formats :  \n-Text files : Rich Text Format (.rtf), plain text data (Unicode, .txt), MS Word (.doc/.docx), eXtensible Mark -up \nLanguage (.xml), Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf), LaTex (.tex) format . \nEstimated yearly storage : 10 MB.  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   11 \n  Dataset 2.2 – Manuscripts  \nIncludes text files, illustrations and figures derived and compiled from experimental data.  \nData formats :  \n- Text files: Rich Text Format (.rtf), plain text data (Unicode, .txt), MS Word (.doc/.docx), eXtensible Mark -\nup Language (.xml), Adobe Portable Document Format (.pd f), LaTex (.tex) format;  \n- Quantitative tabular data: comma -separated value files (.csv), tab -delimited file (.tab), delimited text \n(.txt), MS Excel (.xls/.xlsx), MS Access (.mdb/.accdb);  \n- Digital images in raster formats: uncompressed TIFF (.tif/.tiff), JPEG  (.jpg), JPEG 2000 (.jp2), Adobe \nPortable Document Format (.pdf), bitmap (.bmp), .gif;  \n- Digital images in vector formats: scalable vector graphics (.svg), encapsulated postscript (.eps), Scalable \nVector Graphics (.svg), Adobe Illustrator (.ai);  \n- Digital vide o data: MPEG -4 High Profile (.mp4), motion JPEG 2000 (.mjp2), Audio Video Interleave (.avi) . \nEstimated yearly storage : 150 MB.  \nWill a metadata standard be used to make it \neasier to find and reuse the data ? \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard will \nbe used. If not, please specify which metadata \nwill be created to make the data easier to find \nand reuse.  \nREPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN \nFORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. \nSTANDARD LISTS WITH UNI QUE IDENTIFIERS . ☒ Yes \n☐ No \nMetadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, \nby taking careful notes that refer to specific datasets.  While specific data types may  require particular \nmetadata,  as a general rule the metadata will be based on a generalized metadata schema such as Dublin \nCore or DataCite, including the following elements:  \n• Title: free text  \n• Creator: last name, first name, organization  \n• Date and time reference  \n• Subject: Choice of keywords and classifications  \n• Description: Text explaining the content of the dataset and other contextual information needed for the \ncorrect interpretation of the data, the software(s) (including version number) used to produce and to read \nthe data, the purpose of the experiment, etc.  \n• Format: Details of the file format  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   12 \n  • Resource Type: dataset, image, audio, etc.  \n• Identifier: DOI (when applicable)  \n• Access rights: closed access, embargoed access, restricted access, open access.  \nFor specific datasets, additional metadata will be associated with the data file as appropriate. The final \ndataset as deposited in the chosen data repository will be accompanied by this information under the form \nof a README.txt document. This file will be loc ated in the top level directory of the dataset and will also list \nthe contents of the other files and outline the file -naming convention used. This will allow the data to be \nunderstood by other members of the laboratory/scientific community and add context ual value to the \ndataset for future reuse.  \n \n4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project  \n \nWhere will the data be stored?  As a rule, digital data will be stored on KU Leuven servers.  \nAll omics data generated during the project will be stored on KU Leuven servers or, for larger datasets, on \nThe Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC) in the staging area, at first. Upon publication, all omics data \nsupporting a manuscript will be made publicly  available via open access repositories such as the PRIDE \nArchive for proteomics data, the EMBL -EBI platform for genomics and epigenomics data, and the LIPID MAPS \nLipidomics Gateway for lipidomics data.  \nHow will the data be backed up?  \nWHAT STORAGE AND BAC KUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO \nPREVENT DATA LOSS ? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS , STORAGE MEDIA AND \nPROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP \nDIGITAL AND NON -DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH .1 \nREFER TO INSTITUTION -SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP \nPROCEDURES  WHEN APPROPRIATE . The operating system of the KU  Leuven vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of \nupgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound \nby the ICT cod e of conduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. Stored data is backed up using snapshot \ntechnology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. As standard, \n10% of the requested storage is reserved for backups using the following backup regime: an hourly backup \n(at 8am, 12pm, 4pm and 8pm), the last 6 of which are kept; a daily backup  at midnight, the last 6 of which \nare kept; and a weekly backup at midnight between Saturday and Sunday, the last 2 of which are ke pt. A \nsecurity service monitors the technical installations continuously, even outside working hours.  \n \n1 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric:  https:// osf.io/2z5g3/  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   13 \n Is there currently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities  are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.  ☒ Yes \n☐ No \nIf yes, please specify concisely:  \nIf no, please specify :  \nWe give preference to the use of robust, managed storage with automatic backup. Options include central \nstorage facilities of the research unit, the group or KU Leuven, or a cloud service offered by KU Leuven, all \nof which have sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project.  \nHow will you ensure that the data are securely \nstored and not accessed or modified  by \nunauthorized persons?  \nCLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , \nNETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES ) \nTHAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA \nARE SAFE . 1 \n Animal administrative, husbandry and animal welfare data are sensitive data and are stored in the LAIS \ndatabase according to security procedure of KU Leuven.  \nFor any other sensitive data, we  will abide by the Belgian law on the protection of individuals with regard to \nthe processing of personal data (30th July 2018) and the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679. The \nPrivacy Team of KU Leuven will be notified before the start of the proj ect research starts and the Data \nStewart will therefore:  \n- designate the categories of persons who have access to the sensitive data, with a precise description of \ntheir capacity in relation to the processing of these data;  \n- keep the list of the designate d categories of persons at the disposal of the competent supervisory authority \n(Data Protection Authority);  \n- ensure that the designated persons are obliged by a legal or statutory obligation, or by an equivalent \ncontractual provision, to observe the confi dential nature of the data concerned.  \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and \nbackup during the research project? How will \nthese costs be covered?  Our intention is to minimize data storage costs by sharing  data, and this through the  implementatio n of \nstandard procedures for e.g. metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the \nproject, and by using free -to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Unless \nmentioned otherwise, data management co sts will be covered by the laboratory budget.  \nAll digital files  \nDigital files will be stored on KU Leuven servers:  \n- the “L -drive” costs 173,78€/TB/Year. This server is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel \nFile System (GPFS) cluster with NetApp e series storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front -\nend. Stored data is backed up daily using snap shot technology, where all incremental changes in respect \nof the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept.  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   14 \n  - The “J -drive” costs 519€/TB/Year. This server is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controllers  with \nan Ontap 9.1P9 operati ng system. Stored data is backed up using snapshot technology where all \nincremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. Backups are performed hourly, \ndaily and weekly; in each case the last 6 backups are kept.  \nBoth servers are acce ssible only by laboratory members, and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for \nbusiness continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. We \nwill use free -to-use repositories to share digital files, so that  there will be no additional cost required to \nmake the data open access.  \nVectors  \nAll published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the non -profit plasmid repository \nAddgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request . The associated costs are thus \nminimal (only shipment costs). All other vectors generated during the project will be shared with researchers \nupon request (handling by the technical staff of the laboratory, shipping costs supported by the receiver).  \nManage ment of the vector collection is under the responsibility of the PI and the lab manager. Long -term \npreservation of this collection is of extremely high value for the laboratory, and as a general rule , at least \ntwo independently obtained clones will be pres erved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA \n(in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock ( -80°C). These will be stored for the remainder of the PI’s \nresearch career. Note that any DNA sequences derived from human subjects will be de -identified.  \nGenetically modified organisms  \nMaintaining a mouse colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), excluding the costs of \ngenotyping. When no experiment is planned with a particular mouse strain, and in compliance with the 3R’s \nrule (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk), cryopreservation will thus be used to safeguard the strain, prevent genetic \ndrift, loss of transgene and potential infections or breeding problems. Cryopreservation of sperm/embryos \ncosts about 500 to 700 euro per genotype,  plus a minimal annual storage fee (25 euro per strain for 250 to \n500 embryos). Frozen specimen are kept in two separate liquid nitrogen tanks at two different sites on \ncampus. When necessary, the costs of revitalization from cryopreserved sperm/embryos ar e about \n1,100/600 euro  respectively . \n \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   15 \n 5. Data Preservation  after the end of the Research P roject  \n \nWhich data will be retained for at least five years \n(or longer, in agreement with other retention \npolicies that are applicable) after the end of the  \nproject? In case some data cannot be preserved , \nclearly state the reasons for this  \n(e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). The data will be stored for a minimum of 10 years, i.e. at least 5 years after t he end of the project. After this \nperiod, the PI will regularly evaluate whether retention of the data is still necessary and, if applicable, delete \ndata.  \nWhere will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long -term)?  Images will be archived using the OMERO platform.  \nUpon publication, all omics data supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available (and archived) via \nopen access repositories such as the PRIDE Archive for proteomics data, the EMBL -EBI platform for genomics \nand ep igenomics data and the LIPID MAPS Lipidomics Gateway for lipidomics data.  \nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during the expected retention \nperiod? How will these costs be covered?  Similarly to the data management costs during the project, data preservation after the end of the FWO \nproject will be covered by the laboratory budget.  \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   16 \n 6.

The F WO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.

Recent evidence of the lab confined PSEN2 to membrane contact sites (MCSs) of LE/Lys with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In -house interactomics identified an interaction of PSEN2 with an ER contact site pro tein and with nutrient sensing complexes, underscoring a yet unknown role for PSEN2 in inter - organellar communication between LE/Lys and ER. I will combine state -of-the-art super -resolution imaging and spatial interactomics to unravel the integral nano -environment of PSEN2 in LE/Lys -ER MCSs, with a particular attention to explore the functional connection with nutrient sensing and identify substrate involvement. These outcomes will be validated in iPSC -derived neurons and microglia, with a focus on how PSEN2 deficiency vs a familial AD causing mutation impact on endolysosomal homeostasis through modulating organellar communication, and this in both cell -autonomous and non cell-autonomous settings. These novel insights will provide a better understanding on the etiology of endolysosomal dysfunctions at early, preclinical stages of AD. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 3 2.

Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). Digital data will be stored on K U Leuven servers and will be made available together with the accompanying metadata, at the latest at the time of publication. The principle of preservation of data and the minimum preservation term of 10 years after the end of the project will be applied without restriction , both to raw and processed data. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed by e.g. pending publications, potential IP requirements or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be made publicly availabl e as soon as the embargo date is reached. As detailed below, metadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse, and will be conform to community norms. Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be mad e publicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication or an ODC Public Domain Dedicatio n and License, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. In this regard, plasmids can be submitted to Addgene (https://www.addgene.org/depositing/start -deposit/). For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non -disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly desc ribe the types of reuse that are permitted. Before the start of an experiment, suitable metadata standards will be checked at FAIR sharing; using standards as the Minimal Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations (MIBBI) and OME -TIFF for images. The latter is used by the local OMERO platform. In particular, the following datasets will be stored: Dataset 2.1 – Research documentation Research documentation generated or collected from online sources (e.g. Pubmed ) and from collaborators, includin g publications, tutorials, laboratory notes, protocols, animal husbandry data. Data formats : -Text files : Rich Text Format (.rtf), plain text data (Unicode, .txt), MS Word (.doc/.docx), eXtensible Mark -up Language (.xml), Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf), LaTex (.tex) format .

Estimated yearly storage : 150 MB. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNI QUE IDENTIFIERS . ☒ Yes ☐ No Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes that refer to specific datasets. While specific data types may require particular metadata, as a general rule the metadata will be based on a generalized metadata schema such as Dublin Core or DataCite, including the following elements: • Title: free text • Creator: last name, first name, organization • Date and time reference • Subject: Choice of keywords and classifications • Description: Text explaining the content of the dataset and other contextual information needed for the correct interpretation of the data, the software(s) (including version number) used to produce and to read the data, the purpose of the experiment, etc. • Format: Details of the file format FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12 • Resource Type: dataset, image, audio, etc. • Identifier: DOI (when applicable) • Access rights: closed access, embargoed access, restricted access, open access. For specific datasets, additional metadata will be associated with the data file as appropriate. The final dataset as deposited in the chosen data repository will be accompanied by this information under the form of a README.txt document. This file will be loc ated in the top level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file -naming convention used. This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory/scientific community and add context ual value to the dataset for future reuse. 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? As a rule, digital data will be stored on KU Leuven servers. All omics data generated during the project will be stored on KU Leuven servers or, for larger datasets, on The Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC) in the staging area, at first. Upon publication, all omics data supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via open access repositories such as the PRIDE Archive for proteomics data, the EMBL -EBI platform for genomics and epigenomics data, and the LIPID MAPS Lipidomics Gateway for lipidomics data. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BAC KUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS , STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON -DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH .1 REFER TO INSTITUTION -SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE . The operating system of the KU Leuven vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of upgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound by the ICT cod e of conduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. Stored data is backed up using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. As standard, 10% of the requested storage is reserved for backups using the following backup regime: an hourly backup (at 8am, 12pm, 4pm and 8pm), the last 6 of which are kept; a daily backup at midnight, the last 6 of which are kept; and a weekly backup at midnight between Saturday and Sunday, the last 2 of which are ke pt. A security service monitors the technical installations continuously, even outside working hours. 1 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https:// osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13 Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: If no, please specify : We give preference to the use of robust, managed storage with automatic backup. Options include central storage facilities of the research unit, the group or KU Leuven, or a cloud service offered by KU Leuven, all of which have sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES ) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 1 Animal administrative, husbandry and animal welfare data are sensitive data and are stored in the LAIS database according to security procedure of KU Leuven. For any other sensitive data, we will abide by the Belgian law on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data (30th July 2018) and the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679. The Privacy Team of KU Leuven will be notified before the start of the proj ect research starts and the Data Stewart will therefore: - designate the categories of persons who have access to the sensitive data, with a precise description of their capacity in relation to the processing of these data; - keep the list of the designate d categories of persons at the disposal of the competent supervisory authority (Data Protection Authority); - ensure that the designated persons are obliged by a legal or statutory obligation, or by an equivalent contractual provision, to observe the confi dential nature of the data concerned. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Our intention is to minimize data storage costs by sharing data, and this through the implementatio n of standard procedures for e.g. metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free -to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Unless mentioned otherwise, data management co sts will be covered by the laboratory budget. All digital files Digital files will be stored on KU Leuven servers: - the “L -drive” costs 173,78€/TB/Year. This server is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster with NetApp e series storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front - end. Stored data is backed up daily using snap shot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14 - The “J -drive” costs 519€/TB/Year. This server is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controllers with an Ontap 9.1P9 operati ng system. Stored data is backed up using snapshot technology where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. Backups are performed hourly, daily and weekly; in each case the last 6 backups are kept. Both servers are acce ssible only by laboratory members, and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. We will use free -to-use repositories to share digital files, so that there will be no additional cost required to make the data open access. Vectors All published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the non -profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request . The associated costs are thus minimal (only shipment costs). All other vectors generated during the project will be shared with researchers upon request (handling by the technical staff of the laboratory, shipping costs supported by the receiver). Manage ment of the vector collection is under the responsibility of the PI and the lab manager. Long -term preservation of this collection is of extremely high value for the laboratory, and as a general rule , at least two independently obtained clones will be pres erved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock ( -80°C). These will be stored for the remainder of the PI’s research career. Note that any DNA sequences derived from human subjects will be de -identified. Genetically modified organisms Maintaining a mouse colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), excluding the costs of genotyping. When no experiment is planned with a particular mouse strain, and in compliance with the 3R’s rule (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk), cryopreservation will thus be used to safeguard the strain, prevent genetic drift, loss of transgene and potential infections or breeding problems. Cryopreservation of sperm/embryos costs about 500 to 700 euro per genotype, plus a minimal annual storage fee (25 euro per strain for 250 to 500 embryos). Frozen specimen are kept in two separate liquid nitrogen tanks at two different sites on campus. When necessary, the costs of revitalization from cryopreserved sperm/embryos ar e about 1,100/600 euro respectively . FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 15 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). The data will be stored for a minimum of 10 years, i.e. at least 5 years after t he end of the project. After this period, the PI will regularly evaluate whether retention of the data is still necessary and, if applicable, delete data. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? Images will be archived using the OMERO platform. Upon publication, all omics data supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available (and archived) via open access repositories such as the PRIDE Archive for proteomics data, the EMBL -EBI platform for genomics and ep igenomics data and the LIPID MAPS Lipidomics Gateway for lipidomics data. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Similarly to the data management costs during the project, data preservation after the end of the FWO project will be covered by the laboratory budget. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 16 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATASET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABL E, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY .

If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. Metadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse, and will be conform to community norms. Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories that support FAIR d ata sharing. When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS ’. As previously stated, n o embargo will be foreseen unless imposed by e.g. pending publications, potential IP requirements or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be made publicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 17 Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS . IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED , THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED . DO NOT E THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT . EXAMPLE ANSWER : E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS .” 2 Datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Ded ication or an ODC Public Domain Dedication and License , with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corres ponding DOI. For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non -disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here . INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA . ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes: not available yet What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? As stated above, it is the intention to minimize data sharing costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free -to- use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. 7. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project? The research and technical staff will gen erate, collect, process, analyze and store the data listed above, as detailed in the project description. All staff members are committed to conduct high quality research. In particular, standard protocols will be followed to collect data, if needed after appropriate training. Data and methods used will be regularly discussed during team and lab meetings to ensure a high level of confidence in the data generated. 2 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 18 Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project? Regarding data security, transfer of sensitive data will be performed according to the best practices for “Copying data to the secure environment” defined by KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of upgra des and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound by the ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. Stored data is backed up using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. As standard, 10% of the requested storage is reserved for backups using the following backup regime: an hourly backup (at 8am, 12pm, 4pm and 8pm), the last 6 of which are kept; a daily backup at midnight, th e last 6 of which are kept; and a weekly backup at midnight between Saturday and Sunday, the last 2 of which are kept. A security service monitors the technical installations continuously, even outside working hours. Who will manage data preservation and sharing? The PI is responsible for data management. Access to the digital vault is possible only by using a KU Leuven user -ID and password, and user rights only grant access to the data in their own vault. Who will update and implement this DMP? The PI bears the overall responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP ."
