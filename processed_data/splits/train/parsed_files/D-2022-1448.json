Among the enzymes comprising this pathway, FabI, an enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase\n(ENR), was identified as the target of triclosan, one of the most common additives to consumer\nproducts. In recent years, FabI inhibitors with a better bio-availability and toxicity profile have been\nreported as a potential new class of antibiotics. Yet, several notorious and highly pathogenic\nbacteria, such P. aeruginosa, an opportunistic â€œsuperbugâ€​ have been shown to be resistant to\nFabI inhibitors as they (co)express FabV, an ENR isoenzyme. In the current project, FabV inhibitors\nwill be identified and optimized as a potential new class of antibiotics, acting through the re-\nsensitization to FabI inhibitors.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
