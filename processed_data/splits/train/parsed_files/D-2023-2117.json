We have recently demonstrated that fluorescence-activated cell sorting has significant potential to increase the sensitivity of\nforensic DNA analysis. This project aims to build further on these advancements by (1) designing and developing a cell preselection\nmicrofluidic device for application in two of the most common samples in forensic investigations (i.e., post-coital swabs and trace contact\nsamples) and (2) validation and accreditation of this new analytical protocol in an ISO17025 accredited laboratory. Miniaturising the\nprocess of cell preselection will reduce (1) sample loss, (2) the number of cells required for analysis, (3) cost, (4) turn-around-time and\nmost importantly (5) increase the sensitivity to detect target cells relevant for the investigation. The µForensiCell project will therefore\nprovide an innovative solution for the analysis of the rapidly increasing number of reported sexual crimes associated with the\nestablishment of Sexual Assault Reference Centres.\nLast modified: \n01-03-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

If so, please comment per dataset or data type\nwhere appropriate. \nYes\nThe μForensiCell project is expected to generate novel IP on the combination of forensic and microfluidics. Although it is difficult to secure IP on purely microfluidic designs, as it is an\novercrowded field, we expect that novel approaches for labelling and staining cells and DNA content from swab and contact trace samples will be developed. This combined with the microfluidic\ntechnical solutions is expected to lead to patentable matter. We will continuously review if protocols or bioassays should be protected by patent filing or trade secret. The consortium as a whole\nand in particular the IOF manager Dr. Dal Dosso, will continuously scout for IP opportunities, always in consultation with LRD. In addition, the microfluidics modules developed during the\nμForensiCell project can be adapted to accommodate multiple types of applications including the detection, sorting and dispensing of single low frequency cells, which is becoming increasingly\nimportant in health sciences. This will also further strengthen the IP position of the microfluidics expertise centre at the Biosensors group, that already holds several patents on microfluidics such\nas a filing (currently at national phase, WO 2020/094848 A1) on a microfluidic chip design used for single cell isolation. When there is concrete potential for tech transfer, the IP related to these\nresearch data will be protected, with the support of KU Leuven LRD (e.g. I. Roelants, A. Beckers, who have been following the microfluidic IP portfolio) and the IOF manager supporting this\nproject (Dr. F. Dal Dosso). \nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material or Data transfer agreements, Research collaboration agreements)? If so,\nplease explain in the comment section to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.\nNo\nThere are no 3rd party agreements in place regarding this project.\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

If so, please explain in the comment section to\nwhat data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.\nYes\nAs of today, a preliminary FTO analysis has not shown major IP conflicts (e.g. search by claims keywords like forensic/crime/criminal did not reveal patents which are dedicated to this specific\nfield of application) but this assumption will be continuously checked and revised during the project when a specific method or device is selected or developed. As we are aware of the impact of\nnot having FTO for a service-oriented with licensing options exploitation plan, in the third year, we will apply for a Wellcome Trust-LRD ignite grant to support an in-depth FTO analysis by external\nIP firm (e.g. DenkIP, as already working with the Biosensors group on another microfluidic file).\nDocumentation and Metadata\nClearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep \ndata understandable and usable\n, for yourself and others, now and in\nthe future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, codebook.tsv etc. where this information is\nrecorded). \nProtocols, the research progress and clear descriptions of obtained data, what they represent and how they were generated, will be collected in the Biosensors group in an electronic\nnotebook (eLABJournal, Bio-ITech). Here, folders will be provided for all subtasks of the project. In each folder, a new file will be made for each experiment, named with the date and\nsubject, and including information on the responsible person (i.e., the person who created the file) as well as version tracking. Each experimental file will contain a section on the objective,\nprotocol, results (a description of results and observations rather than all raw and analyzed data) and conclusions. For each experiment, all raw and analyzed data files will be stored in a\nfolder on the shared server, using the same hierarchical folder structure as the electronic lab notebook. By using the same structure on the server and in the electronic lab notebook,\ncontextual information on the experimentally obtained data can be easily searched and used by a secondary analyst via the electronic notebook.\nMost important (raw) data which lead to publications (e.g. conference proceedings, journal paper) and/or to patents filings, will be stored on the shared folder created on the shared drive\n(J:\\SET-MEBIOS-BIOSENSORS-PROJ-DI0443\\C3 µForensiCell). This folder is open to all the consortium members and is secured and backed-up by the ICTS service of KU Leuven. This\nfolder contains also all the administrative items (e.g. project proposal, project reports, update presentations, contracts).\nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to \nfind and reuse the data\n?  \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. \nIf not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. \nNo\nBeing a highly interdisciplinary project, it is not possible to use a standard metadata system.\nThe Biosensors group will use the electronic lab notebook in which a number of predetermined topics have to be described for each experiment (Objective, protocol, results, and\nconclusion). The electronic lab notebook facilitates searching for particular metadata through a search engine. By mimicking the folder structure of the electronic lab notebook in the server-\nbased folder with the experimental data, linking of the metadata to the actual data will be facilitated.\nThe electronic lab book software will also be used to manage the sample inventory (coded label, position, date) and track samples in and out of the fridges and freezers.\nFor each peer-reviewed article, a separate folder will be made on the server, containing the latest word version and all raw and processed data used in the article. In addition, a separate\nfile will be made in the electronic lab notebook for each article, containing clickable links to all metadata files of data that were used in that particular article, to facilitate tracing back of\nprotocols, results and conclusions.\nData Storage & Back-up during the Research Project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nOther (specify below)\nOneDrive (KU Leuven)\nA folder on the UZ Leuven secured server only accessible to the researchers. The folder is backed-up by ICTS service of UZ Leuven. The folder is open to the researchers involved with a\nUZ login.\nThe time-stamped digital data will be stored in an already created project folder on the shared drive (J:) of KU Leuven. The time-stamped digital metadata will be stored on the server of\nthe electronic labbook (eLABJournal, Bio-ITech), and .pdf exports will be made on a weekly basis to be saved on the shared drive (J:).

How will these costs be covered?\nType 1 server back-end storage with mirror backup for the project share folder will cost 519 Euro per Tb per year. Costs will be covered by the project consumables budget.\nData Preservation after the end of the Research Project\nWhich data will be retained for 10 years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? \nIn case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\nAll data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy\nThe data to be retained during 10 years after the project's end are dissemination data (source files of publications and presentations), documentation on measurements set-ups, and the most\nrelevant measurement data.\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? \nOther (specify below)\nA distinction is made between research data and dissemination data. The research data, namely microscopy images, video recordings and measurement results, will be stored on the archive\nserver (K-drive) of KU Leuven in a folder that is only accessible for the staff of our group. Dissemination data, namely files corresponding to papers and presentations, will be stored on the PI's\nPC, and back-upped daily on the readily accessible server (J-drive) of KU Leuven for permanent storage.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nThe volume corresponding to dissemination data is expected to be relatively low (<10 GB), and therefore can be seamlessly embedded in the PI's allocation on the KU Leuven server. The\ncosts (1000 EUR/year) will be covered by other on-going projects at that point in time.\nThe research data will be stored on the archive server (K-drive) of KU Leuven.

Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for 10 years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy The data to be retained during 10 years after the project's end are dissemination data (source files of publications and presentations), documentation on measurements set-ups, and the most relevant measurement data. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Other (specify below) A distinction is made between research data and dissemination data. The research data, namely microscopy images, video recordings and measurement results, will be stored on the archive server (K-drive) of KU Leuven in a folder that is only accessible for the staff of our group. Dissemination data, namely files corresponding to papers and presentations, will be stored on the PI's PC, and back-upped daily on the readily accessible server (J-drive) of KU Leuven for permanent storage. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The volume corresponding to dissemination data is expected to be relatively low (<10 GB), and therefore can be seamlessly embedded in the PI's allocation on the KU Leuven server. The costs (1000 EUR/year) will be covered by other on-going projects at that point in time. The research data will be stored on the archive server (K-drive) of KU Leuven. The costs will be (12 EUR/100GB/year) will be covered by other on-going projects at that point in time. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Other (specify below) Relevant digital data will be published and made available after the end of the project. Data with valuable IP will be protected prior to publication. We will comply with open access regulations of KU Leuven. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. NA Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. No Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. Other (specify below) KU Leuven RDR (Research Data Repository) NA When will the data be made available? Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 01 March 2023 4 of 5 Upon publication of research results Upon publication of research results, as soon as the research results have been published, the data can be made available to other researchers. Upon request by mail, due to the data volume, access will then be granted to a restricted access repository. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) Do you intend to add a persistent identifier (PID) to your dataset(s), e.g. a DOI or accession number? If already available, please provide it here. No NA What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? A restricted access repository can be implemented through the KU Leuven’s Research Data Repository platform, which provides a platform to upload and share research data. This platform is provided by the university and free of charge. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project? The researchers who will work on this KUL C3 project will be responsible for the data collection, documentation and metadata. They will be trained in data management at the beginning of the project. Supervisors will manage the data storage facilities Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project? The lab technician and researchers who will work on this KUL C3 project will be responsible to store the data on the appropriate accommodation provided by KU Leuven. The ICTS service of KU Leuven is responsible for the back-up of the network drives at KU Leuven. The folders will be managed by the supervisors. Who will manage data preservation and sharing? The PIs of this project will be responsible for the data preservation and eventual reuse of obtained data. Who will update and implement this DMP?
