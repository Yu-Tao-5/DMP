The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Ellen Desie https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5947-9517\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Karen Vancampenhout - 0000-0002-9159-7011\nLars Vesterdal - 0000-0003-0309-3735\nBruno De Vos - 0000-0001-9523-3453\nProject number 1 & title  1292824N - Boosting carbon stability in forest soils: the role of soil biota in climate-smart management\nFunder(s) GrantID 2FWO - 1292824N\nAffiliation(s) ☐ KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\nPlease provide a short project description Rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations call for urgent action to develop strategies for negative emissions,  \nincluding nature-based solutions. The role of forests in climate change mitigation is widely recognized as  \nforests can store vast amounts of carbon both above- and belowground. However, many forest ecosystems  \nare affected by environmental pressures, and are at risk of becoming sources of CO2. As a consequence, EU  \ncountries are setting up large networks to monitor forest soil carbon stocks and assess potential losses and  \ngains. This effort is crucial in understanding emissions and sequestration in forests, but only monitoring  \nstocks is of little help in determining what forests are of risk of turning from a sink into a source, nor do they  \nprovide avenues for management to enhance carbon stabilization in forests in the future. There is a growing  \nbody of literature that pinpoints soil biota as the missing link between forest management and carbon  \nstabilization. In this project, I aim to identify changes in carbon stability and to disentangle the drivers of such  \nchanges, while specifically taking into account the role of soil biota relative to edaphic factors, climate  \nchange and management, in order to ultimately optimize climate-smart-management and boost C stability.\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

Guidance on security for research data Due to the personal nature of OneDrive, files that you do not explicitly share are not accessible to anyone else. As such, a separate folder will be created and encrypted for this dataset. Only the PI and registered collaborating researchers will have access to this folder via the encryption key. KU Leuven network drive, specifically L-drive. The KU Leuven network drives are incorporated within secured KU Leuven environments, are password-protected (including smartphone-based multi-factor identification) and are only accessible by registered collaborating researchers. Only the PI can request access to the network drive for study personnel. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?OneDrive for Business is free for staff and students of KU Leuven. The Department of Movement Sciences provides our research group (Physical Activity, Sports & Health) with an Ldrive. As such, costs will be covered by the department. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 95. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): Digital data: The generated research data, metadata and documentation necessary to reuse the data will be transferred to the K-drive (LVS network drive) for long-term data archiving, managed by KU Leuven ICTS with automatic back-up procedures. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Given the expected size of the database of less than 1 GB, costs for long-term storage are estimated to be 0. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☐ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☒ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: All digital data will be made available in a restricted access repository. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Scientific researchers will have to motivate why they want access to the data: What topic are you studying? How is the data linked to your research domain? Why do you think you need this data? Which question/problem will the data help with? What do you expect the data to provide you with? We will always ask to give credit to the original data creators when the data it is being used by other researchers. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Other data repository (specify) ☐ Other (specify) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11When will the data be made available? ☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. Check the RDR guidance on licences for data and software sources code or consult the License selector tool to help you choose. ☒ CC-BY 4.0 (data) ☐ Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) ☐ MIT licence (code) ☐ GNU GPL-3.0 (code) ☐ Other (specify) Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☒ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☐ No A DOI will be available through RDR, but is not yet available What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? RDR is free for KU Leuven personnel, hence, no costs are expected for data sharing. 7.
