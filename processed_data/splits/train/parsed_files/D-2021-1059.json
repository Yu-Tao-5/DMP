Actively unfolding sociocultural formations and processes of development are\nsurveyed with a case study in Dawei District, southern Myanmar, generating novel insights into\nthe linkages between globalized tourism imaginaries and political economy. This project expands\nthe methodological affordances of anthropology by conjoining qualitative ethnography, discourse\nanalysis, and close reading in the pursuit of three objectives: 1) identify and historicize dominant\ntourism imaginaries, 2) trace how imaginaries produce systems of development and\nconsumption, and 3) uncover the potential for imaginaries to be reconfigured. By embedding\nwith residents in Dawei Districtâ€™s Pa Nyit village, who are actively seeking to retain local\nautonomy as development sweeps the region, this project asks if community-based resistance\ncan produce new or alternative imaginaries and developmental trajectories. As COVID-19 and the\nacceleration of climate change disrupt local lifeways and transnational networks of mobility,\ndocumenting community strategies for adaptation to these existential dilemmas suggests more\nsustainable avenues for the future of global tourism.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 5\nQualitative\ndata ~50\ninterviews\naudio\nrecordings\nstored in\n.mp3\nformat;\ntranscribed\ninto MS\nWord\nformat\n10-12 GB\nFace-to-face\nand online\ninterviews with\ntourism\nworkers,\ntourists, and\nresidents in\ntourism\ndestinations\nField notes\nhandwritten\non paper;\ntranscribed\ninto MS\nWord\nformat\n<1 GB\nWritten at the\nconclusion of\nsessions of\nparticipant\nobservation\nPhotographs\n.jpeg\n10 GB\nTaken with a\nphone or a\nDSLR camera\nduring\nparticipant\nobservation\n \n \n \n \n3. Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nYes\nPrivacy Registry Reference: G-2021-4251-RS(MAR)\nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used:\nNational origin, age, and gender will be asked of all interview subjects. With ethnographic\nparticipants, if they are comfortable I will additionally inquire about class status, occupation, and\npersonal hobbies. All of this personal data will only be identified in field notes and subsequent\ndatabases via pseudonyms.\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nYes\nKindly see my PRET approval, G-2021-4251-RS(MAR)\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation?

If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\n1) A ReadMe file will be created for the interview codings, containing information regarding the\ninterview methodology, period and location of collection, storage process, and relevant\ntranscripts.

The\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 5\nphotographs will be noted by category. This ReadMe file will be updated as the project\nprogresses and more interviews are conducted, transcripts are generated, and photographs\ntaken.\n2) All interviews will be manually coded using a grounded approach for dominant themes (.xlsx).\nAll codings will be written following psuedonymization protocols. \n3) Transcripts will be created for the interviews (.doc), with all identifying information following\npsuedonymization protocols. The transcripts will be noted in relation to the interviews on the\nReadMe file.\n4) Photographs (.jpeg) will be categorized according to research location in separate folders and\norganized by date, e.g., 'wadi alsahtan - 2022.03.09'. The folders will be listed on the ReadMe\nfile.\nThe ReadMe file, interview codings, transcripts, and photographs will be contained in a folder\nthat will be uploaded to OneDrive and the J: server at KU Leuven. All data will be deleted from my\npersonal (password-protected) laptop at the conclusion of the project, yet it will be retained on\nOneDrive and the J: server for 10 years.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nA ReadMe file will be created that will log the different forms of retained data, following the\ntemplate provided by KU Leuven.

Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\n1) Data will be stored on a personal password-protected laptop during fieldwork and data\nprocessing, and backed up on OneDrive.\n2) Because interviews and photographs potentially contain personal data, only psuedonymized\ndata will be uploaded to the J: server.\n3) All data will be deleted from the personal laptop at the conclusion of the project.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe data will be backed up on OneDrive automatically through a folder that is linked to the\npersonal laptop where data collection and analysis is taking place. Backup will take place\nwhenever there is internet connection, potentially only disrupted during periods of remote\nfieldwork.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThe total data collected is not expected to exceed 25 GB, for which ample room is provided on\nboth the personal laptop and OneDrive.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nThere are no additional costs expected as a result of data storage, as the personal laptop is\nalready purchased and OneDrive access already provided.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nThe data during fieldwork and analysis is stored on a password-protected laptop, and during the\nwriting up stage of the project following initial analysis it will be secured with FileVault.

Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\n1) interview codings\n2) interview transcripts (psuedonymized)\n3) photographs (psuedonymized; e.g., with faces blurred)\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\n1. The data will be retained on OneDrive for the period of my tenancy at KU Leuven.\n2.

How will the costs be covered?\n1. There are no additional costs expected in the retention of data. The dataset is unlikely to\nexceed 25 GB, and as the ICTS storage guide notes, there is no additional cost for files under 100\nGB.\n7.

In line with anthropological practices, if participants contact the PI and say they want their\ndata removed, all data relevant to this participant will be destroyed at a potentially earlier date\nthan 10 years.\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\n1. The full project dataset will be available upon request, in order to protect research\nparticipants.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nUpon request by mail\n1.
