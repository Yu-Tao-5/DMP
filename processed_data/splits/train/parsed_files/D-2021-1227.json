Although cellular heterogeneity can have a genetic origin, there is growing\nevidence that cancer cells can acquire diverse phenotypic properties, including stem-like\nfeatures, without any genomic alterations, through â€œphenotype switchingâ€​. Combining\nsingle-cell RNA sequencing approaches with in vivo lineage tracing and mathematical modeling,\nthe host laboratory identified a dedifferentiated/stem-like cell state that exhibits a high\ndifferentiation potential. Preliminary evidence indicated that this population may exhibit cancer\nstem cell properties. I propose herein to establish their functional contribution to primary and\nmetastatic growth using genetic lineage tracing and ablation experiments. Importantly, this\npopulation is spatially distributed in close proximity to blood vessels indicating that this\nphenotype may be induced and/or maintained by a perivascular niche. I therefore propose to\nidentify intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms of tumor-stromal cell interactions that regulate their\ncellular identity, cell reprogramming ability (i.e. plasticity) and phenotype. I will then test\nwhether pharmacological interventions that target key niche-dependent CSC specification\nmechanisms can restrict melanoma growth. This project will pave the way for the development of\ninnovative therapies that contend with, or even exploit, the â€œchameleonicâ€​ behavior of\ncancer cells.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
