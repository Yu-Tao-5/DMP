These\nservices range from traditional, fixed bus lines to a fully flexible door-to-door Uber service. However, multiple case studies report that the\nimplementation of these services is not straightforward. The identified research gap between theory and practice is that these services are studied\nseparately and not as part of a bigger transportation system.

Yes RDR, the data management tool of KU Leuven has such a standard. For code, standard practice concerning readability and documentation will be used. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? The data will be stored on the research computer of the researcher, with a back up at the internal storage drives of the research group. Cloud services, such as KU Leuven onedrive will be used as well. Gitlab is used for code. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? The internal drive of the research group provided by the department is used as a backup, this drive has an auto backup. For code, gitlab works with version control. So if necesarry, a rollback to a previous version of the code can be made as well. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes KUL OneDrive and Gitlab quota are sufficient for the entirety of the project. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Security checks are in line with KU Leuven regulations (e.g. dual factor authentication for accessing all platforms where data is shared, such as gitlab, teams, onedrive,...). Some platforms, such as gitlab, furthermore use leveled access. This makes it impossible for non-authorised to access these files. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? No additional cost are expected 4.

In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). institutional policies...). KU Leuven research data management policy stipulates that all relevant data generated are retained for a period of minimally 10 years after the Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 11 March 2024 6 of 10 end of the project. This will be followed. The GitLab repository of the group including all the developed codes stays intact irrespective of people finishing their research and moving on to other projects. All data related to publications will necessarily be retained along with other important unpublished data. The possibility of publication of open-source tools as formal publications with permanent public identifier is currently being examined for other packages in the group and will become our standard for open-science publishing. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? After the research is concluded, the data will be kept at RDR as well as the internal storage drive of the research group and the gitlab. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The stored data is assumed to be small enough to not incur additional costs. 5. Data sharing and reuse 5.
