However, the pathogenesis of MAS, and\nin particular the development of liver pathology, remains incompletely understood. Recently, a\nnew cell population with an extensive cytokine-producing ability, designated as type 1 innate\nlymphoid cells (ILC1s), has been described in mice and humans. Nevertheless, studies\ninvestigating the role of ILC1s in cytokine storm syndromes are scarce and even lacking in case\nof MAS. We identified the expansion of a highly activated ILC1-like population in the liver and\nother organs from a mouse model for MAS, and in blood of patients with MAS. This project aims\nto elucidate the development of this population in the context of MAS and to explore their role in\nthe induction of the cytokine storm and hepatic failure in MAS. By using peripheral blood\nmononuclear cells of patients with MAS, we will translate our findings to the clinical setting.\nClarifying factors involved in induction of ILC1-like cells and exposing their role in inflammation-\ninduced damage will provide a breakthrough in our understanding of the pathogenesis of MAS\nand in particular the development of liver pathology.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nReuse existing data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nDuring this research project, several types of data will be collected including raw\nresearch data and patient data. An overview of the different categories of data collection can be\nfound in the table below. We estimate that 500 GB of data will be collected per year, so in total\nwe will generate 2 TB of data after 4 years. Next to the collection of new data, we will also reuse\ndata of patient samples previously collected by Dr. Jessica Vandenhaute. The aims\nof this research project fit in the ethical committee project submission of Dr. J.

The collected patient data\nconsist of general characteristics (i.e. age, sex) as well as disease-specific information\n(e.g. plasma levels of inflammatory markers, type of treatment, etc.)\nand the results of functional assays and immunophenotyping of leukocytes. The data of healthy\ncontrols consist of general characteristics and the results of functional assays and\nimmunophenotyping of leukocytes. All patient data will be collected by Prof. Dr. Carine Wouters\nand Dr. Lien De Somer. When the researchers\nreceive the patient data, this data is always pseudonymized to make patient name\ntracing impossible.\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)?

Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nDocumentation including experimental protocols, breeding schemes, and observational numeric\ndata will be recorded in physical lab books and stored into Word or Excel files, which\nautomatically imprint the metadata (user, date, time,\nequipment parameters) from these experiments. Data folders containing raw and processed data\nwill be hierarchically organized and labeled based on the date of data generation, the number of\nthe experiment and the source of the data. Imaging data will be created by default with\nmetadata imprinted by the image acquisition\nsoftware automatically. This includes information on user, data and time, duration of\nexperiments, equipment parameters and imaging configurations. The metadata are\nsaved and transferred with the original imaging file. The created data files will be\norganized in folders named by the data of the experiment (DDMMYYYY) followed by\nthe research who performed it and the title of the experiment. Overall, all files will be stored in\nthe KU Leven shared Storage space (J-Drive), with sharing possibilities via Box Sync and One\nDrive (managed by the KU Leuven IT department).\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nElectronical data will be stored in conformity with KU Leuven and FWO RDM policy. All datatypes,\nincluding protocols, raw data and analysed data, will be stored at a shared Rega Drive. We will\nkeep a copy of all data on an external hard disc and/or computer, and on the KU Leuven One\ndrive account. There is sufficient storage and backup available at the Rega Institute. In case\nadditional storage is required, the KU Leuven data centre provides storage on two additional\nlocations, in order to preserve data for a period of more than 20 years. Hard copy notebooks with\nraw data will be stored physically in our laboratory.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nWe will use the central server storage of KU Leuven (Data centre ICTS Luna storage),\nwhich provides a daily automatic back up. Moreover, the data will be backed up on the\nRega Institute Virtual Drives (Rega NAS (network adapted storage)) and on external\nhard-drives kept by the investigators.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nEnough storage and back-up capacity is available at the systems of Rega Institute\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 6\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nLong-term data storage and costs will be managed by the principal investigator\nworking in the project, Prof. Dr. Patrick Matthys and our IT-manager (Mr Dieter Devos). The cost\nfor data storage is 519\neuro/TB/year, thus the accumulated cost for 4 years is approximately 2000 euro. The\ncosts will be covered by previous funding obtained by the host lab and by the bench\nfee offered by the FWO PhD fellowship.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nTo protect our data, the shared Rega drive is secured with a login connected to your personal KU\nLeuven account and password.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nPatient data will be preserved for four years as required by the informed consent form of the\nethical\ncommittee of UZ Leuven. All other research data will be stored up to 5 years after the end of the\nproject.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nThe data will be stored redundantly during and after the research on our computers, on\n3 external hard-drives of the researcher, on the personal KU Leuven Onedrive of the\nresearcher and also in the KU Leuven data centers (ICTS Luna storage [J:// drives]\nand Rega NAS [network adapted storage]).\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nThe cost for data storage is 519\neuro/TB/year. Long-term data storage and costs will be managed and evaluated by the principal\ninvestigator of this project, i.e. my promotor Prof. dr. Patrick Matthys.\n7.
