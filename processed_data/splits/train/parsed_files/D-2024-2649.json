In forest plant\nspecies, this threat may be exacerbated by deteriorating microclimates in forest edges that arise as a\nconsequence of severe habitat fragmentation. With over 20% of European forests being\ncharacterized by compromised microclimates, we need an understanding of how edge effects impact\nthe evolutionary potential of understory plant species. Such species are typically long-lived, resulting\nin low rates of genetic and demographic change after environmental disturbances. This renders them\nprone to extinction debts and time-delayed evolution; understudied phenomena that are\nnevertheless critical to long-term forest biological integrity. I hypothesize that (i) understory plant\nspecies face range-wide time-delayed extinctions, (ii) forest edge populations show reduced potential\nto adapt to climate change, and (iii) the presence of core populations can provide evolutionary\nrescue of forest edge populations. I will address these objectives through range-wide genome\nanalyses of the forest specialists Paris quadrifolia and Circaea lutetiana. By studying genomic\nvariation in light of past environmental factors in addition to the current microclimate, I will be able\nto provide novel insights into the spatial distribution of extinction debt and climate resilience within\nand across European forests.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n24-01-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
