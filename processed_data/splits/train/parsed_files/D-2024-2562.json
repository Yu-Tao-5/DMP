The main obstacle to wide-spread commercial adoption is their low stability under moderate heat,\nmoisture and even light. To improve their stability, new MHP configurations are reported frequently utilising cation mixtures, metal dopants, surface\npassivators, different dimensional frameworks/phases, and more. However, the key to better material design is detailed structural characterisation,\nwhich is often lacking in the rush for the highest efficiency materials. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a proven tool for examining\nMHP materials at the local atomic level. This project aims to develop bespoke NMR hardware, designed specifically for the in-situ study of MHPs.\nNamely, magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR under irradiation to study the evolution of the MHP structure under visible light; and sensitivity-optimised\nMAS NMR of MHP thin films printed on slides, allowing nondestructive examination of the materials in their device format. These novel techniques\nwill provide insight into the structure-function relationships of MHP materials in their operating conditions, revealing the degradation pathways that\nhinder their stability, providing a route towards state-of-the art optoelectronic devices.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n10-01-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
