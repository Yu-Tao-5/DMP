If so, please describe these issues further and refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate.☐ Yes, human subject data ☐ Yes, animal data ☐ Yes, dual use ☒ No If yes, please describe: Will you process personal data6? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. If available, add the reference to your file in your host institution's privacy register.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes: -Short description of the kind of personal data that will be used: -Privacy Registry Reference: Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin- offs, commercial exploitation, …)?

If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3.Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded).Sequencing data will be accompanied by README.txt files that clearly describe the origin of the data, the sequencing date and facility, and metadata necessary for reanalysis of the read data. Data analysis including the version of the bioinformatical tools will be noted in digital notebooks and made accessible within the research group upon request. Experimental procedures will be catalogued in duplicate (one physical and one digital) notebooks and exported as .pdf files to prevent data manipulations. Within these notebooks, the experimental procedure, manipulation of samples, as well as the dates of data collection will be noted meticulously. Bacterial and viral count data will be stored in digital and physical notebooks and certified on a monthly basis by the supervisors of the project to prevent data manipulation. Microscopy data will be accompanied with README.txt files to catalogue metadata needed to interpret the images. FWO DMP 1225223N – D. Holtappels 8Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: Folders containing sequencing data will be named by the fellow’s initials, followed by the experiment number and data of data collection: DH_exp001_DDMMYYYY Each folder will be provided with raw sequencing reads (folder: DH_exp00X_rawreads) along with a README.txt including information necessary metadata including details on the sequencing. Processed reads will be included in a separate folder as follows: DH_exp00X_assembledreads which includes a README.txt describing information on the processing of the reads, the assembler used (including version) and data necessary for the reanalysis of the data. Additional files generated will be included in a third folder: DH_exp00X_downstream. A similar set-up will be established for microscopy data If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Data will be stored short term on a personal computer and backed up to the drives of KU Leuven. These drives are accessible lab members upon request. FWO DMP 1225223N – D. Holtappels 9How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.Digital data will be backed-up on a physical hard drive (1 TB data storage) that is securely stored within the lab and is accessible upon request. These physical back-ups are generated after raw sequencing/microscopy data is available to prevent data manipulation and accompanied by README.txt files describing the necessary metadata. Non digital data generated during the project will be signed and dated by the supervisor monthly during one-to-one meetings. Afterwards, pictures or scans will be taken from the notebooks and stored digitally on a hard drive. This hard drive contains a folder with the fellow’s initials including a folder for each month throughout the fellowship with pictures of the notebook from every page of that month. Similarly, digital notebooks will be converted to .pdf files, dated and stored in a similar way. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: A hard drive (1 TB) is available for the fellow to store all the data generated during the project. If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7Temporary digital data will be stored on personal drives to ensure data manipulations from third parties. The external hard drive will be stored in a secured place (locked cabinet) with a key for the supervisor and fellow. This includes the notebook of the fellow and any other data that might be manipulated by others. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP 1225223N – D. Holtappels 10What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?The expected costs for data storage include: 100 euro for an external hard drive and will be covered by the fellow’s bench fee 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All data generated during the project will be kept for at least five years on the drives of KU Leuven within an archived folder. Additionally, the external hard drive will be handed to the supervisor for safe keeping. This includes raw sequencing data, microscopy data, raw count data, as well as processed sequencing data and generated figures and datasheets. Physical notebooks will be kept in a locked closet with limited access by other parties. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?The external hard drive and physical notebooks will be kept for long-term storage in secured cabinets. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?No additional costs will be expected for the retention period.
