The main goal is to associate convex polytopes to algebraic varieties such that significant geometric properties of the\nvariety can be read off from their polytopes. The appearance of convex polytopes in algebraic geometry goes back to Sir Isaac Newton.\nFor example, a toric variety is a certain algebraic variety modeled on a convex polytope. My main goal is to develop new and unifying\ntools to extend the tools from toric varieties to general varieties via toric degenerations.\n \nI will first develop combinatorial tools to construct points in tropical varieties and study their associated Gröbner degenerations. Then, I\nfind explicit characterization for such points leading to toric degenerations, that is their corresponding polynomial ideal is binomial and\nprime. Furthermore, I will study the relations among toric degenerations of a given variety by studying their associated polytopes. In\nparticular, I will study the combinatorial mutations of these polytopes. My goal is to determine isomorphic degenerations and characterize\nthem. Finally, I will provide algorithms to compute tropicalization and toric degenerations for specific families of varieties. As a particular\ncase, I plan to study the Grassmannians and flag varieties.\nLast modified: \n31-03-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
