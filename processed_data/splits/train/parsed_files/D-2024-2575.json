Postprocessing tools for experimental data: they will be added to the RDR repository Research output: there will be made an entry on RDR for each publication/presentation linking the simulation and experimental data and the postprocessing scripts to the corresponding paper. Within our group, we already have an archive space for long-term storage on the VSC cluster, but the idea is to start exploiting \"ManGO\" for active data storage and management.

No For KU Leuven RDR and ManGO the format of the metadata will be tailored to our specific needs of computational experiments. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3.

File synchronization (devices/collaborators) and backup: for version-controlled files, we use the KU Leuven Gitlab service or ITER GIT repository. For other files, we use KU Leuven OneDrive. Large simulation results are stored on a dedicated archive on the VSC cluster. When possible, all relevant data will be made publicly available with the paper. For this, we will use a coupling between ManGO and the KU Leuven RDR system that is designed for this purpose. Manuscripts and all corresponding data are stored on an archive drive in the research group and/or on an archive drive at the VSC depending on the nature of the research data. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? All solutions described above are equipped with automated back-up procedures that are provided by the central university services. Personal laptops of researchers are synced with their home directory on the departmental servers. These servers are backed up as per the above. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes KU Leuven OneDrive services and dedicated archive storage on the VSC (presently 4TB archive storage available) suffice to store the data. If needed, the VSC archive space can be extended. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? All systems described above are configured to prohibit access to unauthorized persons. All data of computational experiments stored in ManGO will be read-only to avoid accidental changes by authorized persons. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? We expect the data management cost can be covered by the working budget of this FWO grant and other research projects within the group. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). institutional policies...). All simulation code, simulation data, scripts and figures/tables that are needed to reproduce published results will be available in open access repositories and findable via a link in the publication. All other data (e.g. on the archive or ManGO) will be retained as long as needed, and at least for five years after the end of the project. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Simulation inputs and relevant outputs, postprocessing tools will be published on the KU Leuven RDR repository in open access Manuscripts and all corresponding data are stored on an archive drive in the research group and/or on an archive drive at the VSC depending on the nature of the research data.

What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Publishing on RDR requires no costs. We expect data management costs to be eligible costs from the working budget of this or other research projects within the research group. Archive storage at the VSC currently costs 100 EUR/TB/year (with 4TB available to the project). 5. Data sharing and reuse 5.
