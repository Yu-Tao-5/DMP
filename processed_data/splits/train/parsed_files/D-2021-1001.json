RDM Guidance on data If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type. Ethical approval by the Ethical Review Committee of the University Hospitals UZ/KU Leuven already obtained before the start of the project (S61883; S62548; S63253; S62795; S62285; S63720; S64325; S65028; S65304; S53364; S65158). Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number.☒ Yes, human subject data; provide SMEC or EC approval number: ☐ Yes, animal data; provide ECD reference number: ☐ Yes, dual use; provide approval number: ☐ No Additional information: The use of clinical data and samples already included in this study is approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the University Hospitals UZ/KU Leuven (S61883; S62548; S63253; S62795; S62285; S63720; S64325; S65028; S65304; S53364; S65158). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 7Will you process personal data4? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number).☒ Yes (provide PRET G-number or EC S-number below) ☐ No Additional information: Ethical approval was obtained by the EC of UZ Leuven S61883; S62548; S63253; S62795; S62285; S63720; S64325; S65028; S65304; S53364; S65158, G-2021-3755 Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin- offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please comment: We envision possible valorization by tech transfer to companies working in the field of liquid biopsy and/or biomarker development: we foresee to patent our pipelines or identified biomarkers and to eventually license the patents to interested companies or create a spin-off. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☒ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: If the generated within the project data will have the valorization potential and lead to IP creation, it will be protected and regulated accordingly to the intellectual property rights and ownership. 3.Documentation and Metadata 4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 8Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .Wet lab protocols are described in detail and recorded in Word files and PDF files, stored in appropriately labelled folders on project-specific KU Leuven OneDrive or UZ Leuven M drive. For some wet lab procedures SOPs from the UZ diagnostic unit will be followed. Where applicable, final bioinformatic scripts will be tracked in Jypiter notebooks and for reproducibility and data analysis will be upload on GitHub platform or e.g. Figshare, which will be accompanied by a README.txt file. Sequencing data will be collected and stored either on KU Leuven Large Volume Storage (L: Drive) and mainly at VSC Flemish Super Computer. A metadata file will be provided with the clear description of the raw data and how they were generated; the metadata file will be kept together with the sequencing data. Clinical data will be stored in RedCap system, or in an Excel file, provided of a README sheet at UZ Leuven M drive. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.Sequencing data will be stored on VSC, accompanied by a metadata file, containing the necessary information to find and re-use specific files (sample key, technical parameters). Sequencing data require specific metadata when submitted to access-controlled repositories (e.g., EGA). Data documentation will be tailored to their ultimate deposition in public repositories. When depositing data in a repository, the final dataset will be accompanied by detailed information regarding technical and analytical methods used to generate and analyze the data, to allow for independent reproduction; bioinformatics scripts will be provided in repositories like Figshare or GitHub. 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9Where will the data be stored?

Guidance on security for research data Data are stored on RedCap, UZ or KU Leuven IT infrastructure (KU Leuven Large Volume Storage, KU Leuven One Drive, UZ Leuven Server and VSC Flemish Super Computer), requiring for the access a Multifactor Authentication. Also, initial access is defined by the corresponding PI research group, so it will be only available to authorized personnel.

How will these costs be covered?VSC Staging storage: € 30 / TB / year. The costs for data storage for this project are foreseen and allocated within the project budget. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): VSC archive for raw digital files and after publication sequencing data will be deposited to European Genome-phenome Archive /GEO data repositories with controlled access meaning that a third party can obtain access to the data only following approval by the KU Leuven/UZ Leuven Data Access Committee (DAC). What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?VSC archive storage: € 30 / TB / year. The costs for data storage for this project are allocated within the project budget and within future projects. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 116.
