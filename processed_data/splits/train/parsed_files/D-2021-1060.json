In study 1, we will\ninvestigate whether BPD patients display more emotional egocentricity and altercentricity than\nHCs when observing others' non-verbal emotion communication. In study 2, we will investigate\nwhether naÃ¯ve observers' emotional responses to BPD patients' emotion communication differ\nfrom responses to HCs. In study 3, videorecordings of interactions with BPD vs. HC participants\nwill be analyzed to compared interpersonal synchrony. Different types of data from human\nparticipants will be collected: (a) self-report questionnaire responses, (b) behavioral responses to\ndifferent task conditions, (c) psychophysiological measures (Heart Rate/Skin Conductance) and\n(d) videorecordings. The purpose for which this data is collected is to answer specific research\nquestions in order to better understand the interpersonal difficulties patients with BPD\nexperience with the goal of improving treatment and overall well-being.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\n- Readme file for each dataset (following KU Leuven\ntemplate https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/README)  \n- Information on the methodology used to collect the data will be published in detail in research\npapers\n- Codebooks and coding rules, describing in detail what the meaning is of the data (how each row\nand each column in the dataset was coded) (.docx, .xls, .csv)\n- Syntax files on how raw data was processed and analyzed (SPSS syntax files .sps; R script .r)\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\n- Demographic information and self-report questionnaires data collected in REDCap (Data types\n1, 2 and 6 in Section 2): Metadata will be exported (as a data dictionary) out of the REDCap\nproject. Each row in the data dictionary corresponds to one field in the project's dataset.\n- For all experimental data (Data types 3, 4 and 5 in Section 2): metadata will be exported out of\nthe experimental software (PsychoPy) in txt. file format.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\n1. The master copy of the data (pseudonymized) will be stored in the university's secure\nenvironment (encrypted network drive with automatic back-up procedures), with a physical\nback-up on a bit-locker encrypted external hard drive.\n2. Anonymized copies can be made and kept on personal devices. Since we will collaborate with\nresearchers from other research units and groups, we will use OneDrive for active use of the\nanonymized data during the project.\n4. The participant name and contact information coupled to the study ID's will be stored\nseparately from the master file in a secure environment. Only the lab manager Yannic Verhaest\n(yannic.verhaest@kuleuven.be) has access to this information.\n5. The videorecordings of the participants (images of participant's faces) cannot be anonymized.\nThe files will be compressed and stored in the university's secure environment, with a physical\nback-up on a bit-locker encrypted external hard drive.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 5\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers (encrypted network drives) with\nautomatic daily back-up procedures. Once per week the data will be backed up on a bit-locker\nencrypted external hard drive.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThis is managed by KU Leuven IT (we pay for the volume we store).\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nThe data will be hosted on the servers of KU Leuven. In view of the expected size (+- 10-15 GB),\nthe estimated cost will be 10-20 euros per year. This will be covered by the FWO bench fee.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nAll data will be de-identified and merged in a master file. Each participant's record will be stored\npseudonymized (the personally identifiable information will be removed and replaced by a\nunique study identifier). Only the data lab manager (Yannic Verhaest,\nyannic.verhaest@upckuleuven.be) will be able to link these codes to the person (which is needed\nto contact participants for follow-up measures). This linking file will be password encrypted and\nstored within the secure UZ Leuven network (accessed only by Yannic Verhaest). All physical\ndata (i.e., informed consent) will be stored in a locked archive closet. The video-recordings\ncannot be anonymised and will be compressed and securely stored on the university's secure\nenvironment for private data. \n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nIn line with the regulations of KU Leuven, the anonymized master file of the data will be\npreserved for 10 years after the end of the study. The link between the participant contact\ninformation and the participant study ID's will be destroyed at the end of the study. The\nvideorecordings are viewed as a highly valuable dataset that will be preserved for future\nresearch in a safe environment.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nThe anonymized master file of the data will be stored on in the KU Leuven RDR Research Data\nRepository for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.
