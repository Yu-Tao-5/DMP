Important visual quality factors in determining the commercial value and consumer\nacceptance of the fruit, are its size, shape and structure. However, the processes driving and\ncontrolling the development of these features during growth are poorly understood. In order to\nsustain the supply of healthy and high quality fruit while adapting to climate change and\nreducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is therefore crucial to gain insight into the development of\ngrowing fruit. Hereto in this PhD project, a mathematical model of water transport and\nmechanical deformation of growing apple fruit is developed, taking into account the 3D\nmultiscale geometry and vascular formation, for investigation of the quality changes during\ngrowth.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
