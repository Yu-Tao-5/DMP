In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). institutional policies...). All above mentioned data (mass spectrometry data, clinical data collected in REDCAP file) will be retained for 10 years (according to KU Leuven RDM policy). If too much space is needed to store all the data, the raw data generated by the Xevo G3 Q-TOF mass spectrometer will not be maintained for 10 years.
