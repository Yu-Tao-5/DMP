It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all materials that need proper management because they are valuable, difficult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentation/metadata.

RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .SPSS Statistics Data Documents (.sav) contain a description (i.e. variable list, measurement units, scale information) of each variable in order to keep the data understandable and usable. Readme.txt files provide the necessary information to keep the data in database understandable and usable. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.

Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☐ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☒ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☒ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): Paper data will be sent to an archive (OASIS: https://www.oasisgroup.be/) Digital data (anonymized) will be stored on the central server of UZ Leuven.
