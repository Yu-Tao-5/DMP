SCFA are proposed as potential mediators of the health benefits associated with fiber intake as they affect the\nphysiology either locally in the gut or via the systemic circulation.

However, while SCFA are absorbed in the colon upon fiber consumption, SCFA are absorbed in the small\nintestine upon consuming fermented foods.

KU Leuven's ICT solutions adhere to stringent university-wide information security protocols. Access\npermissions for the raw network storage managed by the faculty's ICT service are strictly regulated, delegated, and audited by designated data\nmanagers who are trained for this role, regardless of their IT expertise. For the code files, which include pseudonyms, access is tightly\ncontrolled by a dedicated data manager, with the Principal Investigator serving as an alternate overseer.

This corresponds with a cost of\n503.66 euro/TB/year or in total 2014.64 euro (4x 503.66 euro x 1 TB). For metabolomics and microbiota data we will use the large volume\nstorage which will cost 104.42 euro/ year/TB. The data will only be collected during the final part of the project and therefore we expect that\nthe large volume storage will cost in total 835.36 euro (2 years x 4 TB x 104.42 euro).

Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Demographic data and questionnaires (VAS_appetite and GSRS) will be kept on RedCap software to which only assigned employees of our lab have access to. During the research project, data folders containing pseudonymized clinical data, processed data, sample lists and scripts will be stored on the KU Leuven shared J-drive assigned to our group. The code file with the name, email and bank account of participants and the assigned pseudonym will be stored in a separate file on the shared drive, secured with a password known by the principle and executing investigator. Sequencing (microbiome) and metabolomics data will be kept on the KUL L- large volume storage assigned to our group. The informed consents will be kept in a locked cabinet. Once the project has ended, all data will be stored on the KUL large volume storage (assigned to our group) for long term preservation. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up?

Last modiﬁed 10 April 2024 6 of 9 Yes There is still 1 TB available on the shared J drive which is enough for the clinical data of ~ 5 GB. The large volume storage contains 8 PB which is enough to store the metabolomics and microbiome data (4TB) during the project and all data for long term preservation. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? To secure our data, we store it within KU Leuven's shared drive and Large Volume Storage both compliant with high and medium confidentiality standards, respectively. KU Leuven's ICT solutions adhere to stringent university-wide information security protocols. Access permissions for the raw network storage managed by the faculty's ICT service are strictly regulated, delegated, and audited by designated data managers who are trained for this role, regardless of their IT expertise. For the code files, which include pseudonyms, access is tightly controlled by a dedicated data manager, with the Principal Investigator serving as an alternate overseer. Researchers involved in the project are granted access exclusively to pseudonymized data, ensuring that personal identifiers are not disclosed. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? We expect that we need around 5 GB storage space on the shared drive for the clinical data of this project. This corresponds with a cost of 503.66 euro/TB/year or in total 2014.64 euro (4x 503.66 euro x 1 TB). For metabolomics and microbiota data we will use the large volume storage which will cost 104.42 euro/ year/TB. The data will only be collected during the final part of the project and therefore we expect that the large volume storage will cost in total 835.36 euro (2 years x 4 TB x 104.42 euro). These expenses will be covered using our current grant money and through future grant applications. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project 4.

In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). institutional policies...). The digital data of this research project, biological samples and the informed consents will be preserved for 25 years as according to CTC recommendations for clinical experiments on humans. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? For long term preservation the digital data of the project will be stored on the large volume storage provided by KU Leuven. Biological samples will be managed and stored by the UZ/KU Leuven Biobank. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The expected costs for 25 years data preservation on the large volume storage are 13502.5 euros (104.42 euro/year/TB). The costs will be covered with our current grant money and through future grant applications. 5. Data sharing and reuse 5.
