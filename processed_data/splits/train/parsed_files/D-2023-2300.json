For  many  \nbiomaterials,  strategies  to  achieve  the  advantageous  unification  between  structure  and  mechanical  \nproperties have been through millions of years of evolution, as in the case of nacre, one good example of a  \nmaterial that combines high strength, high stiffness, and high toughness.\nInspired by nature strategies to increase toughness, BioInter proposes to engineer the interface of  \ncomposites by creating alternate sections around the fibre and along the fibre length of high and low  \nadhesion with the matrix using micro-plasma surface deposition and activation, promoting intermittent  \nsections of high and low shear strength during the process of debonding. The strong regions ensure that the  \nfilament strength is taken, while the weak areas weaken the running crack, creating a complex pattern for  \ncrack evolution.\nInstitution: KU Leuven\n1. GENERAL INFORMATION\nName applicant: Yentl Swolfs\nFWO Project Number & Title:  G0D5323N, Bio-inspired design of fibre interfaces with intermittent weak \nand strong areas for obtaining tough composites\n2. DATA DESCRIPTION\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?  \n●Generate new data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. \nThis may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and per WP or objective of the \nproject. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of these data.  Distinguish data types (the \nkind of content) from data formats (the technical format).\nType of data Format Volume How created \nOptical and scanning \nelectron microscopy \nimages.tiff 10 GB Taken using an optical \nmicroscope or scanning \nelectron microscope\nAbaqus simulation files .inp, .odb, .cae 4 TB Processed with Avizo\n2- Simulation trajectories\n- Analysis and post-\nprocessed results.gro, .xtc, .trr, .pdb, .m, .py\n, .xyz50 TB From MD solvers like \nLAMMPS and Gromacs\n3. LEGAL AND ETHICAL ISSUES\nWill you use personal data?  If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add the \nreference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for Research and Public Service  \nPurposes (PRET application).   Be aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is  \na legal obligation.\n●No\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on \nhumans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant \nethical review committee(s)\n●Yes\nCarbon fibres are dual-use items. The KU Leuven “Ethics Committee on Dual Use, Military use & Misuse \nof Research” sets out three questions:\n-Does the research have a military finality?\n-Is the research part of a sensitive call?\n-Is there a sensitive partner, funding body, end use(r) due to the project content?\nThe answer to all three questions is clearly no for this project, which implies that we do not to apply for \nexplicit approval of the committee.\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? \nWill IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions \nwill be asserted? \n●No\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If \nso, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\n●No\n4. DOCUMENTATION AND METADATA\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this \nproject?\n1. For the optical images: camera details, magnification, sample dimension  \n32. For the scanning electron images: SEM details, voltage, current, magnification, sample dimensions, \ncoating details\n3. For the Abaqus simulation files: The Abaqus and Python scripts will contain comments\nabout specific features implemented in the models. The .inp and .cae files store all input information\nin terms of material properties, behaviours and geometric features of the model, so this can easily be \ntraced back afterwards. Together with the Python scripts, this provides enough information to enable the \nreuse of the models.\n4. For the molecular dynamics simulations: The LAMMPS and Gromacs input files, e.g. data (topology) \nand input script (simulation parameters) files, as well as Python and MATLAB scripts to process the XYZ \ndump files generated by the MD solvers.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so,  describe in detail which standard will be used.  If no, \nstate in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse.\n●Yes\nFor the optical images, manual metadata will be created including the data mentioned above. For the \nscanning electron microscopy images, this data is automatically created.  \nFor the CSV and TIFF data, the ISA-Tab standard, developed at the University of Oxford, will be followed.  \n5. DATA STORAGE AND BACKUP DURING THE FWO PROJECT\nWhere will the data be stored?  \nAll the data will be stored on the hard drives of the researchers involved in this project, and the smaller \nfiles will be stored on OneDrive.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe researchers will regularly backup their data on our NAS system.  \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will  \nbe taken care of.\n●Yes\nWe have enough space on our NAS for the mentioned data. We will buy one hard drive per researcher to \nenable easy access to the data.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these \ncosts be covered? \nWe will buy 2 external hard drives. Our NAS still has enough storage capacity at the moment, so we only \nneed minor further investment if one of the current hard drives fails.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified \nby unauthorized persons?\n4Our data is not highly sensitive. The data on our NAS and hard drives are encrypted, and access to our \nNAS is limited to a few people in the group. The selected data on OneDrive is only accessible to the \nresearchers themselves.  \n6. DATA PRESERVATION AFTER THE FWO PROJECT\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case \nonly a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or \ncontractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nThe data will be retained for 5 years after the end of the project. When the researchers eventually leave \nKU Leuven, the responsibility will be transferred to Prof. Yentl Swolfs.  \nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nOn the NAS and the external HDDs.  \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years?

However, we will make the most \nuseful images and model data available through supplementary information, a Data-in-Brief article or \nMendeley Data. \nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\n●In an Open Access repository\nWe already regularly publish datasets on Mendeley Data with an accompanying Data in Brief Journal \npaper. We will do the same for the current project.  \nWhen will the data be made available?\n●Upon publication of the research results\nWe will make the data publicly available as soon as the results are submitted for publication.  \n5Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nBoth Mendeley Data and Data in Brief articles are open access.
