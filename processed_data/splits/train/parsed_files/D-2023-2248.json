In TBI and other causes of \nacute brain injury, primary damage is followed by a cascade of secondary events with brain ischemia as a final \ncommon result. Providing oxygen and energy to the brain through adequate cerebral blood flow (CBF) is critical in \nmanaging patients. Real-time monitoring of CBF and the status of its protective autoregulatory mechanisms – that are  \noften impaired following injury – is still impossible to date. It leaves clinicians uncertain with only indirect assessments  \nand no proactive or swift means of therapeutic action. Through a collaborative effort, we have recently demonstrated \nusing ultrasound neuroimaging (USNI) that high-resolution hemodynamic measurements in a porcine cranial window \nmodel are strongly correlated with CBF changes. We have also performed a complete characterization of the \ncerebrovascular autoregulation curve. Our project aims at establishing the complex links between CBF, \nautoregulation status, currently monitored physiological variables in TBI patients in the intensive care unit (ICP, CPP, \nPbO2), brain activity and brain ischemia. We will investigate the efficiency of USNI for decision support and prediction  \nof ischemia in a translational TBI pig model. We will also evaluate the effect on ischemia of distinct therapies to aim to  \nimprove CBF. If successful, our results are highly transferrable to patients.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 32.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.
