By focusing on everyday\nmovements and infrastructural engagements of a displaced community (from the Gali region) across a militarized border, the project asks: How do\npeople constitute, experience, and perceive the conflict spaces that they inhabit? The study proposes the concept of infrastructural mobilities, and aims\nto theorize the experiential and spatial dynamism of spaces of long-term conflict in ways that challenge state and territory centric analyses. In doing so,\nit works at the nexus of anthropological studies of contested spaces and sovereignties, borders and mobility, and infrastructure and materiality. The\nproject expands the affordances of ethnographic methodologies by cultivating sensory techniques (interviews-in-motion, mapping-and-narrating), and\npursues three objectives: 1) identify and examine the sociopolitical backgrounds of the infrastructures intersecting with everyday mobilities of the Gali\npopulation, 2) unpack how crosscutting infrastructures and mobilities shape each other and constitute places, 3) examine how infrastructural mobilities\nimpact the Gali people’s perceptions of the contested borderland. At a time of wars and refugee crises in Europe, the project seeks to capture the\ncomplexity of life in conflict zones, and question the normative definitions of territory and borders. \nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n27-05-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Responsible Person: Dr. Noel Salazar During data collection, data will be backed up on password protected personal laptop and secured with FileVault, with copies uploaded to OneDrive and J: server at KU Leuven. During analysis and write-up, data will be retained in personal laptop, OneDrive, J: server. At project’s conclusion, data deleted from personal laptop but retained on OneDrive and J: server. All data will be stored in password-protected computers at KU Leuven and retained for 10 years after the research.
