In reality, despite large efforts of the\nscientific community and a strong industrial interest, bringing gene therapy to the market has proven challenging. The major hurdles faced by gene\ntherapy come in the form of its safety and efficacy with off- target effects caused by low specificity or inappropriate transgene expression levels. The\nuse of well-designed synthetic regulatory regions, called enhancers, could provide a solution to reach cell type-specificity and high levels of transgene\nexpression. This SBO project proposes to develop new computational and experimental tools, and combine them in a pipeline to identify enhancers in\ncomplex tissues. This pipeline will exploit recent advances in single-cell multi-omics, gene regulatory network (GRN) inference, and deep learning.\nWe will use this pipeline to design enhancers that are specifically active in three chosen brain cell types that are of high relevance for gene therapy.\nPractically, we will: 1) use mouse and human brain samples to generate a single-cell multi- omic atlas; 2) select unique regulatory regions to each cell\ntype and train enhancer models; and 3) design and validate synthetic enhancers in vivo, using massively parallel reporter assays. As a clinically\nrelevant case study, we will focus on microglia enhancers in the context of Alzheimer’s disease. In parallel, we will use the AI-based GRN and\nenhancer models to interpret and prioritize regulatory variation in whole genome sequences, in order to improve diagnosis and prediction of risk and\nprogression for neurodegenerative disease. Our project will yield licensable enhancers, software tools, and diagnostic AI models with direct industrial\napplicability, and will demonstrate our ability to interpret and generate enhancers specific to any cell type, which can find application in a wide range\nof diseases, even beyond the scope of our project.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n05-03-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

All published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the\nnon-profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request.\nCell lines: Newly created human cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid nitrogen storage and will be deposited in the\nUZ Leuven-KU Leuven Biobank. Other human cell lines will be stored locally in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory when\nactively used for experiments. Animal cell lines will be stored in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory.\nBacterial strains will be stored in a -80°C freezer. \nGenetically modified organisms: Mice will be maintained in facilities of the Laboratory Animal Center of KU Leuven, which applies\nStandard Operation Procedures concerning housing, feeding, health monitoring to assure consistent care in accordance with European and\nnational regulations and guidelines. All animals will be registered in the Leuven Animal Information System (LAIS) database, along with\ncorresponding genotyping information, ethical approval documents and animal provider receipts. \nHow will the data be backed up?\nHow will the data be backed up?\nKU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme:\n- data stored in manGO: Snapshots are made at regular intervals (hourly, daily and monthly) in case data needs to be recovered. The data itself\nis synchronized on two separate hardware storage systems, each 6 PB large, located at Leuven and at Heverlee (ICTS). The data is protected\nagainst calamities at either site by synchronizing it in real-time at hardware level. \n- data stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version\nare kept online; the last 14 backups are kept.\n- data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in\neach case the last 6 backups are kept.\n- data stored on the digital vault is backed up using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are\nkept online. As standard, 10% of the requested storage is reserved for backups using the following backup regime: an hourly backup (at 8 a.m.,\n12 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.), the last 6 of which are kept; a daily backup (every day) at midnight, the last 6 of which are kept; and a weekly\nbackup (every week) at midnight between Saturday and Sunday, the last 2 of which are kept.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project?

Data in these drives are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business\ncontinuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour.\nAccess to the digital vault is possible only through using a KU Leuven user-id and password, and user rights only grant access to the data in\ntheir own vault. Sensitive data transfer will be performed according to the best practices for “Copying data to the secure environment” defined\nby KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of upgrades and security patches.\nThe server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound by the ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root\nrights. A security service monitors the technical installations continuously, even outside working hours. Only the PI and medical team\nmembers will be granted access to the server to deposit private data.

How will these costs be covered?\n-The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 569,2€/5TB/Year for the “L-drive”, 519€/TB/Year for the “J-drive”, and 35€/TB/Year for the\nManGO platform. Data storage and backup costs are included in general lab costs.\n-Maintaining a mouse colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), excluding the costs of genotyping. When no experiment is\nplanned with a particular mouse strain, and in compliance with the 3R’s rule (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk), cryopreservation will thus be used to\nsafeguard the strain, prevent genetic drift, loss of transgene and potential infections or breeding problems. Cryopreservation of sperm/embryos\ncosts about 500 to 700 euro per genotype, plus a minimal annual storage fee (25 euro per strain for 250 to 500 embryos). Frozen specimen are\nkept in two separate liquid nitrogen tanks at two different sites on campus.

In reality, despite large efforts of the scientific community and a strong industrial interest, bringing gene therapy to the market has proven challenging. The major hurdles faced by gene therapy come in the form of its safety and efficacy with off- target effects caused by low specificity or inappropriate transgene expression levels. The use of well-designed synthetic regulatory regions, called enhancers, could provide a solution to reach cell type-specificity and high levels of transgene expression. This SBO project proposes to develop new computational and experimental tools, and combine them in a pipeline to identify enhancers in complex tissues. This pipeline will exploit recent advances in single-cell multi-omics, gene regulatory network (GRN) inference, and deep learning. We will use this pipeline to design enhancers that are specifically active in three chosen brain cell types that are of high relevance for gene therapy. Practically, we will: 1) use mouse and human brain samples to generate a single-cell multi- omic atlas; 2) select unique regulatory regions to each cell type and train enhancer models; and 3) design and validate synthetic enhancers in vivo, using massively parallel reporter assays. As a clinically relevant case study, we will focus on microglia enhancers in the context of Alzheimer’s disease. In parallel, we will use the AI-based GRN and enhancer models to interpret and prioritize regulatory variation in whole genome sequences, in order to improve diagnosis and prediction of risk and progression for neurodegenerative disease. Our project will yield licensable enhancers, software tools, and diagnostic AI models with direct industrial applicability, and will demonstrate our ability to interpret and generate enhancers specific to any cell type, which can find application in a wide range of diseases, even beyond the scope of our project.

Human Bodily Materials and Data Human Bodily Materials and Data Data creation: This study will generate new sequencing data from human samples. We will seek approval from Ethics Committee Research UZ / KU Leuven for the use of HBM for this purpose to ensure ethical compliance. Some of these efforts are already ongoing, such as the analysis of samples from the ASAP consortium, and have already obtained ethical approval. We will also be re-using sequencing data that was previously generated by consortium members. We will ensure that this use falls under the previous approvals granted by the Ethics Committee. For the ex vivo study of human organotypic brain slices, we will be using patient brain material that is being collected in an existing study. The JDW lab already has approval for the use of these materials. Data re-use: We will be re-using sequencing data generated by others. In doing so, we will adhere to the Data Transfer Agreement (DTA) and the Data Access Committee (DAC) guidelines of the data provider. Laboratory Animal Experiments Laboratory Animal Experiments We will be conducting experiments on mice and will seek approval from the Ethical Committee for Animal Experimentation before their initiation. For ex vivo experiments involving Rhesus macaques, we already have obtained approval before the start of this project. We will seek additional approval for any in vivo experiments involving Rhesus macaques that will be conducted during the project.

Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Digital data Digital data Primary storage for active digital files active digital files will be on KU Leuven servers. KU Leuven offers fast (\"J-drive) and slower (\"L-drive\") storage that allows reading/writing/modification of non-confidential, confidential, and strictly confidential data. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 05 March 2024 10 of 14 KU Leuven further offers the ManGO platform for storage and management of large volumes of active research data large volumes of active research data . This platform allows secure storage, manual and automated metadata coupling, data workflows, and file sharing. Data that is no longer active, can be archived archived on the KU Leuven K-drive, which allows reading of non-confidential, confidential, and strictly confidential data. Personal data Personal data of human subjects will be stored on a dedicated KU Leuven secure server (Digital vault). Algorithms, scripts and software Algorithms, scripts and software : All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software code will be stored on the lab GitHub account (https://github.com/aertslab). Omics Omics data: omics data generated during the project will be stored on KU Leuven servers or on the ManGO platform. Upon publication, all sequences supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via repositories such as the GenBank database or the European Nucleotide Archive (nucleotide sequences from primers / new genes / new genomes), NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (microarray data / RNA-seq data / CHIPseq data), the Protein Database (for protein sequences), or the EBI European Genome-phenome Archive (for human (epi)genome and transcriptome sequences). Physical samples Physical samples Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory. All human tissue samples will be registered with a Belgian biobank, in compliance with the Belgian law on human body material (dd 19-12-2008). Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacterial glycerol stock (-80°C). All published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request. Cell lines: Newly created human cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid nitrogen storage and will be deposited in the UZ Leuven-KU Leuven Biobank. Other human cell lines will be stored locally in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory when actively used for experiments. Animal cell lines will be stored in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory. Bacterial strains will be stored in a -80°C freezer. Genetically modified organisms: Mice will be maintained in facilities of the Laboratory Animal Center of KU Leuven, which applies Standard Operation Procedures concerning housing, feeding, health monitoring to assure consistent care in accordance with European and national regulations and guidelines. All animals will be registered in the Leuven Animal Information System (LAIS) database, along with corresponding genotyping information, ethical approval documents and animal provider receipts. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? KU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme: - data stored in manGO: Snapshots are made at regular intervals (hourly, daily and monthly) in case data needs to be recovered. The data itself is synchronized on two separate hardware storage systems, each 6 PB large, located at Leuven and at Heverlee (ICTS). The data is protected against calamities at either site by synchronizing it in real-time at hardware level. - data stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept. - data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept. - data stored on the digital vault is backed up using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. As standard, 10% of the requested storage is reserved for backups using the following backup regime: an hourly backup (at 8 a.m., 12 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.), the last 6 of which are kept; a daily backup (every day) at midnight, the last 6 of which are kept; and a weekly backup (every week) at midnight between Saturday and Sunday, the last 2 of which are kept. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes KU Leuven servers offer sufficient storage for active data (J/L-drive, ManGO) and archived data (K-drive). Required data-storage volumes can be easily scaled up. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?

The buildings on our campus are restricted by badge system so only employees are allowed in and visitors are allowed under supervision after registration. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 05 March 2024 11 of 14 Access to the “L-drive”, “J-drive”, and ManGO servers is possible only through using a KU Leuven user-id and password, and user rights only grant access to their own data, or data that was shared to them. Data in these drives are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. Access to the digital vault is possible only through using a KU Leuven user-id and password, and user rights only grant access to the data in their own vault. Sensitive data transfer will be performed according to the best practices for “Copying data to the secure environment” defined by KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of upgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound by the ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. A security service monitors the technical installations continuously, even outside working hours. Only the PI and medical team members will be granted access to the server to deposit private data. The PI and medical team members will be the only responsible for linking patient information and/or samples, and will strictly respect confidentiality. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? -The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 569,2€/5TB/Year for the “L-drive”, 519€/TB/Year for the “J-drive”, and 35€/TB/Year for the ManGO platform. Data storage and backup costs are included in general lab costs. -Maintaining a mouse colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), excluding the costs of genotyping. When no experiment is planned with a particular mouse strain, and in compliance with the 3R’s rule (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk), cryopreservation will thus be used to safeguard the strain, prevent genetic drift, loss of transgene and potential infections or breeding problems. Cryopreservation of sperm/embryos costs about 500 to 700 euro per genotype, plus a minimal annual storage fee (25 euro per strain for 250 to 500 embryos). Frozen specimen are kept in two separate liquid nitrogen tanks at two different sites on campus. When necessary, the costs of revitalization from cryopreserved sperm/embryos are about 1,100/600 euro. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project 4.
