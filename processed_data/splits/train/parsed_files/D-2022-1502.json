Electroencephalography (EEG) is by far the most popular non-invasive BCI\nmodality, because it is cheap, mobile, and it has an excellent temporal resolution to track neural\nresponses that are time-locked to a sensory stimulus. However, traditional BCI paradigms heavily\nrely on synthetic and controlled sensory stimuli and an active participation of the user, making it\nvery hard to integrate such paradigms in practical â€˜everyday-lifeâ€™ use cases. If BCI\ntechnology would be able to cope with uncontrolled and natural sensory stimuli, it would be able\nto naturally blend in with normal behavior and activities of the user. \nInspired by recent\nbreakthroughs towards decoding EEG responses to speech, we have the challenging goal to\ndesign a new data-driven methodology to identify and quantify the temporal coupling between\nnatural video footage and its EEG responses. To this end, we will leverage representation\nlearning techniques from the field of computer vision, and rethink them in combination with\nrecent insights in EEG decoding and visual BCI. We will also investigate whether and how this\nframework can be used to track visual and spatial attention to natural stimuli. Not only would this\nbe a game-changing tool for various experiment-driven research fields in neuroscience and\nmedical sciences, it would also pave the way towards many new BCI applications in various\ndomains.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
