The server is only accessible to researchers of the unit. Data is stored and uploaded to the\nserver at the time of experiments and is stored until 10 years after the publication of a manuscript\nwith accessibility by the principal investigator.\nPhysical data are permanently stored in appropriate storage places accessible with permit only (the \nbiobank of the BREATHE consortium).\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?For GBW-0076_LTx the annual cost is 519 euro/terrabyte. We currently use 377 Gigabyte of the 500 \nGigabyte reserved, resulting in an annual cost of 195 euro/year currently.  \nFor GBW-0017_LTx the annual costs are 156,6 euro. We currently use 10,7 terrabytes of the 15 terrabytes \nreserved resulting is a yearly cost of 2350 euro currently.  \nThe overall currently yearly cost for both servers is 2550 euro. The total budget needed for the 6 years of \nthe project is about 15000 euro. These costs are already covered for many years by the running projects \nand will be included in the budget of the laboratory by left budget and new projects.  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 115. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five \nyears (or longer, in agreement with other \nretention policies that are applicable) after the \nend of the project? In case some data cannot be  \npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this  \n(e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\n Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy\n☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with \nmedicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans\n☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain)\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long-term)?\nDedicated data repositories  are often the best place \nto preserve your data. Data not suitable for \npreservation in a repository can be stored using a KU  \nLeuven storage solution, consult the  interactive KU \nLeuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR\n☒ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes)\n☐ Shared network drive (J-drive)\n☐ Other (specifiy):\nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during the expected retention \nperiod? How will these costs be covered?Considering the currently yearly cost we expect costs for data preservation to be about 12500 euro. The \ndepartment CHROMETA reserves for each separate group per years a small budget which is enough to \ncover these annual (and total) cost of basic storage.\n6. Data Sharing and Reuse\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 12Will the data (or part of the data) be made \navailable for reuse after/during the project?  \nPlease explain per dataset or data type which \ndata will be made available.  \nNOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE \nDATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS \nAND USE MAY APPLY.

It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for \nmetadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-\nuse data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be \ncovered by the laboratory budget.\n7. Responsibilities\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 14Who will manage data documentation and \nmetadata during the research project?Data documentation and metadata will be organized by the PIs and fellows organizing the laboratory and \nproject namely Karen Maes (lab manager) and Celine Aelbrecht (lab technician).\nWho will manage data storage and backup \nduring the research project?Both servers are dedicated to the PI of the project and access is managed by the PI and the lab manager. \nICT (Gert Goos as contact person and PI) is handling back-up and if needed expansion of storage capacity.\nWho will manage data preservation and \nsharing?The PI is responsible for data preservation and sharing, with support from the research and technical staff \ninvolved in the project, from Raf De Coster for the KU Leuven drives.\nWho will update and implement this DMP? The PI bears the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP."

Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data.☒ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☒ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☐ Other: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? ☒ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back-ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data Prof. Laurens Ceulemans and Prof. Bart Vanaudenaerde are responsible for the server (secured J-drive and L-drive) of the BREATHE consortium where all digital data is stored. The BREATHE consortium provides a server (secured J-drive and L-drive) where all described datatypes can be stored. The server is only accessible to researchers of the unit. Data is stored and uploaded to the server at the time of experiments and is stored until 10 years after the publication of a manuscript with accessibility by the principal investigator. Physical data are permanently stored in appropriate storage places accessible with permit only (the biobank of the BREATHE consortium). What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?For GBW-0076_LTx the annual cost is 519 euro/terrabyte. We currently use 377 Gigabyte of the 500 Gigabyte reserved, resulting in an annual cost of 195 euro/year currently. For GBW-0017_LTx the annual costs are 156,6 euro. We currently use 10,7 terrabytes of the 15 terrabytes reserved resulting is a yearly cost of 2350 euro currently. The overall currently yearly cost for both servers is 2550 euro. The total budget needed for the 6 years of the project is about 15000 euro. These costs are already covered for many years by the running projects and will be included in the budget of the laboratory by left budget and new projects. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 115. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Considering the currently yearly cost we expect costs for data preservation to be about 12500 euro. The department CHROMETA reserves for each separate group per years a small budget which is enough to cover these annual (and total) cost of basic storage. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☐ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☒ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.People unrelated to the project will be able to reuse the data only after being approved by Prof. Laurens Ceulemans and Prof. Bart Vanaudenaerde. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Other data repository (specify) ☐ Other (specify) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13When will the data be made available? ☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. Check the RDR guidance on licences for data and software sources code or consult the License selector tool to help you choose. ☒ CC-BY 4.0 (data) ☒ Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) ☐ MIT licence (code) ☐ GNU GPL-3.0 (code) ☐ Other (specify) Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☒ No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to- use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. 7. Responsibilities FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 14Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project?Data documentation and metadata will be organized by the PIs and fellows organizing the laboratory and project namely Karen Maes (lab manager) and Celine Aelbrecht (lab technician). Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project?Both servers are dedicated to the PI of the project and access is managed by the PI and the lab manager. ICT (Gert Goos as contact person and PI) is handling back-up and if needed expansion of storage capacity. Who will manage data preservation and sharing?The PI is responsible for data preservation and sharing, with support from the research and technical staff involved in the project, from Raf De Coster for the KU Leuven drives. Who will update and implement this DMP? The PI bears the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP."
