The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders\nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 1\n1.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Daniel Groselj\nOrcid: 0000-0002-5408-3046\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Fabio Bacchini\nOrcid: 0000-0002-7526-8154\nProject number 1 & title  Project number: 12B1424N\nHow relativistic particles shine in astrophysical collisionless plasma turbulence\nFunder(s) GrantID 2\nAffiliation(s)  KU Leuven\nROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\nPlease provide a short project description Coronae of black-hole accretion disks in X-ray binaries and at the cores of active galaxies are\nextremely bright sources of high-energy radiation. The radiation is produced in a hot ionized gas\n(plasma) that shines through emission from relativistic particles. The energization of particles is\nmediated by collisionless plasma processes, among which electromagnetic plasma turbulence is a\nprime contender. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms for high-energy emission\ntherefore requires detailed kinetic models for how the particles are energized and how they pass\ntheir energy to radiation. This project aims to make important breakthroughs on the subject by\nperforming the most detailed kinetic plasma simulations of turbulence coupled with radiative\nprocesses, including ab initio modeling of Compton scattering, production and annihilation of\nelectron-positron pairs. The simulations will be directly compared with observations, particularly with\nthe hard spectral state in X-ray binaries. These results will deepen our understanding of the\nproduction of high-energy emission in extreme astrophysical environments and significantly advance\nthe state-of-the-art in modeling turbulent radiative plasmas.\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

Only these two persons will maintain \nregular access to the data, which requires relevant credentials (username + password + 2-factor \nverification).\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?We estimate to need only 500GB of memory on the shared network drive for the first year since it will be \nmainly dedicated to development and so not very data heavy. For the second and third year, we will \npurchase 2TB on the shared network drive. We will also increasingly need space on the Large Volume \nStorage as we accumulate data from simulations. We estimate 5TB for the second year and 10TB for the \nthird year. Hence, we estimate the costs to be:\n 1st year : ~250 euros\n2nd year : ~1,500 euros\n3rd year : ~2,000 euros\nThese expenses will be covered by the bench fee of 4,000 euros yearly that has already been approved  by \nthe FWO.

Of course, we will keep the configuration\nfiles of each simulations to ensure that we are able to rerun the exact same simulation. Those files are of \nthe order of the KB.\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long-term)?\nDedicated data repositories  are often the best place \nto preserve your data.
