Thus far, no cure is available for MS and current therapies can \ncome with severe  adverse effects as they are based on the depletion of broad ranges of immune cells. Recently, our \ngroup was closely involved in the identification of 236 MS genetic risk variants through genome-wide association \nstudies. These variants are >90% non-coding,  but display significant enrichment for variants affecting gene \nexpression and/or splicing. Increasing evidence points to the cell - and condition specificity of these processes, \nhowever, approaches to study gene expression or splicing have been limited to bulk RNA from broader immune cell \nsubsets in blood. In this project, I will move beyond the state- of-the-art by applying a unique multimodal approach that \nallows quantification of specific variants or splice forms at the single- cell level across thousands of cells. This \napproach adds two layers to the standard single-cell RNA sequencing landscape: one targeted layer to cover variants at specific positions, and a second long-read sequencing layer to optimally detect alternative splicing. After validation of the results by combining RNA with protein level where possible, data integration will take us one step closer to \nuncovering the mechanism of action of MS risk variants, and thereby open the door to novel more targeted therapies \nfor MS.  \n \nLast modified: 06-0 4-2023  \n \n \n \nMULTIPLE SCLEROSIS I MMUNOGENETICS: MOVING TO \nMULTIMODAL SINGLE -CELL RESOLUTION  \nApplication DMP  \n  \nQUESTIONNAIRE  \n \nDescribe the datatypes (surveys, sequences, manuscripts, objects … ) the research will collect and/or \ngenerate and /or (re)use.

DOCUMENTATION AND METADATA  \n \nClearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep \ndata understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of \ndocumentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, \nCodebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded).  \n \nDocumentation including experimental protocols and parameters (concentrations measured, number of cells \ncounted,...) will be recorded in physical laboratory books and stored into Word or Excel files, which also contains the \nnecessary metadata (user, date,...) regarding the experiment.   \nData folders containing the raw and processed data will be hierarchically organized and labeled based on the date of \ndata generation and source of the data. Each main data folder will contain a ReadMe.txt file containing all the \nnecessary information to keep the data understandable and usable.   \nAll of the R scripts will be made in Rmarkdown format and knitted to HTML format so that comments can be added in between the chunks of code, thereby providing explanations to keep the analysis understandable. R markdown files \nautomatically contain metadata (user, date,...)  \nAll of these files will be stored in the KU Leuven share storage space (J -drive) and will be backed up regularly to the \nKU Leuven large storage space (L-drive) and an external hard drive.   \n  \n \n \nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where \nappropriate per  dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where \nappropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.  \n \n● No \nSee above.  \n   \n3. DATA STORAGE & BA CK-UP DURING THE RESEARCH PROJECT  \n \nWhere will the data be stored?  \n \nElectronical data will be stored in conformity with KU Leuven and FWO RDM policy. All datatypes including protocols, \nraw data and analysed data will be stored on KU Leuven file shares (J, K, L). A copy of all data will also be stored on \nan external hard dr ive kept by the researchers in the laboratory. In case additional storage is required, the capacity of \nthe KU Leuven shares can be increased.   \nHard copy laboratory notebooks with raw data and records of the experiments will be physically stored in our laboratory.   \n \n \nHow will the data be backed up?  \n \nThe KU Leuven file shares (central ICTS data centre) provides hourly, daily and weekly automatic back ups. These \nback -ups are saved on their servers.   \nMoreover, the data will also be backed- up on external hard dr ives kept by the researchers in the laboratory.   \n \n \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.  \nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.  \n \n● Yes \nYes, enough storage and back -up capacity is available on the KU Leuven shares. In case additional storage is \nrequired, the capacity of the KU Leuven shares can be increased.  \n  How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized \npersons?  \n \nTo ensure our data is protected, the KU Leuven shares are secured with a login and password connected to our KU Leuven accounts. Only members of our laboratory have access to these drives.   \n \n \nWhat are the expected  costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs \nbe covered?  \n \nData storage and costs will be managed by the principal investigator responsible for this project, Prof. An Goris. The \ncosts for data storage is € 503.66/TB/y ear, which comes to approximately € 2000 for the duration of this FWO \nfellowship.   \nThe costs will be covered by previous funding obtained by the laboratory and/or by the FWO fellowship bench fee.   \n   \n4. DATA PRESERVATION  AFTER THE END OF THE RESEARCH PROJECT  \n \nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that \nare applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved,  clearly state the reasons \nfor this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).  \n \nPhysical samples from patients and controls will be kept for 30 years, as stated in the informed consent form signed by the par ticipants. Clinical data from patients and controls will be kept for at least 25 years, according to \nrecommendations for clinical trials.  \nAccording to KU Leuven RDM policy, all other research data will be kept for at least 10 years.   \n  \n \n \nWhere will these d ata be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)?  \n \nDuring and after the research project, data will be stored on KU Leuven shares. The same data will also be backed-\nup on an external hard drive.   \nThe registry containing all clinical data of patients and controls will be stored on UZ Leuven drives, with adequate \nback -up provided by UZ Leuven.  \n \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these \ncosts be covered?  \n \nData that need to be easily accessed w ill be stored on the KU Leuven shares J -drive, for which the costs are € \n503.66/TB/year. On the longer term, data can be preserved on the K -drive, specifically dedicated to archive storage. \nThis costs € 5.69/100Gb/year.   \nLong-term data storage and costs wi ll be managed and evaluated by the principal investigator responsible for this \nproject, Prof. An Goris  \n \n \n \n5. DATA SHARING AND REUSE \n \nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  In the comment \nsection please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available.  \n \n● No (closed access)  \n● Yes, in an Open Access repository  \n● Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …)  \nCounts matrix (or raw data) of single- cell RNA sequencing data will be made available in an open access repository \nsuch as GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus). Scripts will be shared upon request.   \nThe rest of the data will not be made available to third parties . \n \n \nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.  \n \n/ \n  \nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an \nagreement with a 3rd party, legal restri ctions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data \ntype where appropriate.  \n \n● No \n/ \n \n \nWhere will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.  \n \nThe raw single- cell sequencing data (or count s matrix) will be made available in an open access repository such as \nGEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) if this is a requirement from the journal.  \nThe scripts for data analysis will be shared upon request, for example through a (private- GitHub repository.  \n \n \nWhen will the data be made available?  \n \nThe data that will be shared, namely the counts matrix from single-cell RNA sequencing data and the scripts, will be \nmade available upon publication.   \n  Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, plea se explain why.  \n \nAs advised by the KU Leuven RDM helpdesk and the license selector tool, we will use the Creative Commons \nAttribution-ShareAlike (CC BY -SA-4.0) license. This license allows others to use, copy, distribute, and modify the \ndata for any purpose, as long as the original source is properly attributed and any modifications are distributed under \nthe same license terms  \n  \nDo you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the \noption to provide it in the comment section.  \n \n● Yes \nData in the GEO repository will be granted a GEO accession number.   \n \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing?

DOCUMENTATION AND METADATA Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). Documentation including experimental protocols and parameters (concentrations measured, number of cells counted,...) will be recorded in physical laboratory books and stored into Word or Excel files, which also contains the necessary metadata (user, date,...) regarding the experiment. Data folders containing the raw and processed data will be hierarchically organized and labeled based on the date of data generation and source of the data. Each main data folder will contain a ReadMe.txt file containing all the necessary information to keep the data understandable and usable. All of the R scripts will be made in Rmarkdown format and knitted to HTML format so that comments can be added in between the chunks of code, thereby providing explanations to keep the analysis understandable. R markdown files automatically contain metadata (user, date,...) All of these files will be stored in the KU Leuven share storage space (J -drive) and will be backed up regularly to the KU Leuven large storage space (L-drive) and an external hard drive. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. ● No See above. 3. DATA STORAGE & BA CK-UP DURING THE RESEARCH PROJECT Where will the data be stored? Electronical data will be stored in conformity with KU Leuven and FWO RDM policy. All datatypes including protocols, raw data and analysed data will be stored on KU Leuven file shares (J, K, L). A copy of all data will also be stored on an external hard dr ive kept by the researchers in the laboratory. In case additional storage is required, the capacity of the KU Leuven shares can be increased. Hard copy laboratory notebooks with raw data and records of the experiments will be physically stored in our laboratory. How will the data be backed up? The KU Leuven file shares (central ICTS data centre) provides hourly, daily and weekly automatic back ups. These back -ups are saved on their servers. Moreover, the data will also be backed- up on external hard dr ives kept by the researchers in the laboratory. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ● Yes Yes, enough storage and back -up capacity is available on the KU Leuven shares. In case additional storage is required, the capacity of the KU Leuven shares can be increased. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? To ensure our data is protected, the KU Leuven shares are secured with a login and password connected to our KU Leuven accounts. Only members of our laboratory have access to these drives. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Data storage and costs will be managed by the principal investigator responsible for this project, Prof. An Goris. The costs for data storage is € 503.66/TB/y ear, which comes to approximately € 2000 for the duration of this FWO fellowship. The costs will be covered by previous funding obtained by the laboratory and/or by the FWO fellowship bench fee. 4. DATA PRESERVATION AFTER THE END OF THE RESEARCH PROJECT Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Physical samples from patients and controls will be kept for 30 years, as stated in the informed consent form signed by the par ticipants. Clinical data from patients and controls will be kept for at least 25 years, according to recommendations for clinical trials. According to KU Leuven RDM policy, all other research data will be kept for at least 10 years. Where will these d ata be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? During and after the research project, data will be stored on KU Leuven shares. The same data will also be backed- up on an external hard drive. The registry containing all clinical data of patients and controls will be stored on UZ Leuven drives, with adequate back -up provided by UZ Leuven. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Data that need to be easily accessed w ill be stored on the KU Leuven shares J -drive, for which the costs are € 503.66/TB/year. On the longer term, data can be preserved on the K -drive, specifically dedicated to archive storage. This costs € 5.69/100Gb/year. Long-term data storage and costs wi ll be managed and evaluated by the principal investigator responsible for this project, Prof. An Goris 5. DATA SHARING AND REUSE Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. ● No (closed access) ● Yes, in an Open Access repository ● Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) Counts matrix (or raw data) of single- cell RNA sequencing data will be made available in an open access repository such as GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus). Scripts will be shared upon request. The rest of the data will not be made available to third parties . If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. / Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restri ctions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. ● No / Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. The raw single- cell sequencing data (or count s matrix) will be made available in an open access repository such as GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) if this is a requirement from the journal. The scripts for data analysis will be shared upon request, for example through a (private- GitHub repository. When will the data be made available? The data that will be shared, namely the counts matrix from single-cell RNA sequencing data and the scripts, will be made available upon publication. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, plea se explain why. As advised by the KU Leuven RDM helpdesk and the license selector tool, we will use the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY -SA-4.0) license. This license allows others to use, copy, distribute, and modify the data for any purpose, as long as the original source is properly attributed and any modifications are distributed under the same license terms Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. ● Yes Data in the GEO repository will be granted a GEO accession number. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Sharing single-cell RNA sequencing data ion GEO is usually free of charge for smaller datasets. The basic GitHub accesses are also free for individuals and organization. 6. RESPONSIBILITIES Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project?
