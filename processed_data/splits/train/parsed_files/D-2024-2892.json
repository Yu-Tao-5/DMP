The Christological controversies sparked by the Council of Chalcedon in 451 led to divisions between\nchurches that persist to the present. Late antique letters offer rich details about interactions between leaders of the anti-Chalcedonian, miaphysite\nmovement which over the course of the sixth century became the Syriac Orthodox Church. The twenty-seven letters of Philoxenus of Mabbug (d. 523),\na bishop and major actor in the miaphysite movement, form the earliest corpus of ten or more letters in Syriac but have never been the subject of a\ndedicated study. This project uses Philoxenus’s letters as a focal point to understand the miaphysite movement from the perspective of its epistolary\nculture. Alongside a comprehensive dissertation on Philoxenus’s letters and the emerging Syriac Orthodox Church, the project will publish a suite of\ndigital fascicles that lay a foundation for further studies on Syriac letters and are linked with digital humanities projects in other fields extending the\npotential impact of the research. The project will thus lead to a breakthrough in the understanding of the history and literature of a religious community\nwhose voice has been marginalized in western accounts of the history of Christianity but whose heritage and future are tied to that of Europe.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n16-02-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
