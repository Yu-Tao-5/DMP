Nieuwe behandelingsopties op basis van immunotherapie hebben bij een klein deel van de patiënten veelbelovende resultaten\nlaten zien, maar bij veel anderen is het niet effectief. Een belangrijke reden hiervoor is direct gecorreleerd met een niet-immunogene tumor micro-\nomgeving (TME). Er bestaan verschillende manieren om de immunogeniciteit van de TME te verbeteren, waaronder adoptieve overdracht van door\nchimere antigeenreceptor (CAR) gemanipuleerde T- of natural killer (NK)-cellen, inductie van immunogene celdood of inductie van hoge endotheliale\nvenulen (HEV). Al deze methoden lijden echter aan de gevaren van off-target effecten en mogen alleen worden toegepast op de tumor of metastatische\nlocaties. In het huidige project stellen we voor om nanotechnologie te gebruiken om deze problemen te overwinnen door de activering van alle\ntherapieën mogelijk te maken door middel van nabij-infrarood licht (NIR) en hierbij selectief de therapeutische middelen die aanwezig zijn op de\ntumorplaats te activeren.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n26-07-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
