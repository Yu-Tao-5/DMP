It results from sensitisation of TRP (transient receptor\npotential) channels located on visceral afferent nerves, a phenomenon mediated by histamine\nreleased by mast cells. Histamine 1 receptor antagonism blocks TRP sensitisation and improves\nsymptoms in 50% of IBS patients. As TRP channels are also sensitised by other mast cell\nmediators, therapeutic success will be further improved by intervening with the intracellular\nmechanism involved in TRP sensitization, an approach that is independent of the initiating\ntrigger. Recently, we showed that resolvin D2 could be an interesting candidate; it prevents and\nreverses histamine-induced TRPV1 sensitisation via activation of its receptor GPR18, an\ninhibitory G protein coupled receptor. In this project, we want to further explore the therapeutic\npotential of GPR18 agonists. These insights are critical for our understanding of IBS and for\ndevelopment of novel treatment modalities.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. Data Description\nWhat data will you collect or create?
