To effectively manage these plant\npathogens, their timely detection and accurate identification is of crucial importance. Although detection technologies have improved over the years,\nboth in accuracy and sensitivity, detecting multiple plant pathogens simultaneously remains a challenge. Up until now, a diagnostic tool that combines\nhigh speed with high-throughput, multiplexing, and accurate pathogen identification is still lacking. In response to the market demands, a Nanopore-\nbased amplicon sequencing approach (Nanotect) is used in this project. This platform allows simultaneous detection and accurate identification of\nbacterial, fungal and oomycete plant pathogens in a single assay. To attain this goal, a novel approach is used in which multiple and large genetic\nmarkers are sequenced simultaneously on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION device. In this project, optimal genetic markers are selected and\namplified. Next, a data analysis pipeline is developed and optimized, which includes a machine learning approach that improves accuracy of\ntaxonomic identification. The Nanotect platform is further evaluated by analysis of spiked water and plant samples. Finally, this novel detection\nplatform is benchmarked to currently used detection techniques regarding several parameters, including accuracy, sensitivity, cost-effectiveness, and\nanalysis time.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n29-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

The alignment is \nnecessary for the evaluation of the candidate genes, as \n(1) it allows for a visual confirmation of the presence \nof highly variable (for identification) and highly \nconserved (possible primer binding sites) through the \ngeneration of a Shannon diversity plot. (2) The \nalignment is then used to generate a consensus \nsequence, which can subsequently be used for the \ncreation of possible primers.

These in silico \nevaluations will primarily concern the assessment of \nthe broad targetting potential of the universal primers. \nFor this purpose, compatible primer pairs will be used \nto extract their targetted regions on the large panel of \ngenomes (see 1.1). Subsequently, it will be assessed \nwhether the primers are specific (only the intented \ntarget is amplified). And lastly, the amount of \nmismatches the primers have with their intended \ntargets. For this, a combination of publicly available \nsoftware tools, as well as in-house developed scripts \nwill be used.

This will be in various file formats \ndepending on their availability. Next, candidate \ngenetic markers are extracted from these genome \nassemblies, preferably by annotation, using an in-\nhouse developed script.

The resulting \ndata will be used to evaluate various sequencing result \nanalyses, to select the best performing targets. \nFurthermore, the discriminative capacities of the \nselected genetic markers can be evaluated, together \nwith the efficiency and performance of the primers \n(PCR bias, sequencing bias, etc.).generate new \ndatadigital experimental.fast5\n.pod5 \n.fastq \n.fasta \n.xlsx<5TB\nWP2: \nConstruction \nof sequencing \ndata analysis \npipelines2.1 Creating a suitable \nreference sequence \ndatabase for the \nselected genetic \nmarkersThe selected primers are used to extract gene \nsequences from publicly available genomes from the \nNCBI assembly database.

Although detection technologies have improved over the years, both in accuracy and sensitivity, detecting multiple plant pathogens simultaneously remains a challenge. Up until now, a diagnostic tool that combines high speed with high-throughput, multiplexing, and accurate pathogen identification is still lacking. In response to the market demands, a Nanopore- based amplicon sequencing approach (Nanotect) is used in this project.

To attain this goal, a novel approach is used in which multiple and large genetic markers are sequenced simultaneously on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION device. In this project, optimal genetic markers are selected and amplified. Next, a data analysis pipeline is developed and optimized, which includes a machine learning approach that improves accuracy of taxonomic identification. The Nanotect platform is further evaluated by analysis of spiked water and plant samples. Finally, this novel detection platform is benchmarked to currently used detection techniques regarding several parameters, including accuracy, sensitivity, cost-effectiveness, and analysis time.

The alignment is necessary for the evaluation of the candidate genes, as (1) it allows for a visual confirmation of the presence of highly variable (for identification) and highly conserved (possible primer binding sites) through the generation of a Shannon diversity plot. (2) The alignment is then used to generate a consensus sequence, which can subsequently be used for the creation of possible primers. These primers are selected based on parameters estimated by the primer design software, such as length, degeneracy, melting temperature, etc. reuse existing data generate new datadigitalcompiled/agg regated data.fasta .py .png .xslx<1GB 1.3 In silico evaluation of designed primersCompatible primer pairs will be evaluated in silico before continuing with PCR tests. These in silico evaluations will primarily concern the assessment of the broad targetting potential of the universal primers. For this purpose, compatible primer pairs will be used to extract their targetted regions on the large panel of genomes (see 1.1). Subsequently, it will be assessed whether the primers are specific (only the intented target is amplified). And lastly, the amount of mismatches the primers have with their intended targets. For this, a combination of publicly available software tools, as well as in-house developed scripts will be used. The 3 best performing primer pairs for each genetic marker will be used for further analysis.generate new datadigitalcompiled/agg regated data experimental.tsv .xlsx .gff<1GB 1.4 Obtaining genomic material of microorganismsA representative panel of microorganisms, obtained from the host-lab's culture collection, will be used to evaluate the performance of the primers. In order to achieve this, genomic material of a taxonomically diverse group of microorganisms is used. The respective microorganisms are cultured, and their DNA is extracted. The microorganisms will be stored in a -80 °C freezer, whilst the genomic DNA will be stored in a -20 °C freezer for the remainder of the project. generate new dataphysicalvials of genomic DNA, labelled and stored in boxes at - 20°CAppendix 1 1.1 Obtain genomes and extracting candidate genetic markers for universal primer design of large ampliconsFor the purpose of generating novel, larger than conventional, universal primers, a collection of genomes obtained from NCBI assemblies (only representative and reference genomes) is downloaded. This will be in various file formats depending on their availability. Next, candidate genetic markers are extracted from these genome assemblies, preferably by annotation, using an in- house developed script. The sequences of the selected genes are then compiled into a single fasta file.Reuse existing datadigitalcompiled/agg regated data.fasta .gbff .py<1 TB 1.5 Evaluating the primers on a representative panel of microorganismsThe primers are evaluated against the representative panel of microorganisms with PCR reactions using both DNA templates consisting of singular and a combination of genomes (i.e. mock communities). They will be evaluated on factors such as specificity, sensitivity, amplification efficiency, universality (all strains show amplification), etc. In addition, PCR optimizations occur simultaneously by performing temperature gradient PCRs, increasing polymerase concentrations, increasing extension times, etc. The resulting best primer pairs, and their optimized PCR conditions will be used to generate the DNA amplicon libraries for the subsequent Nanopore sequencing.generate new datadigital experimental.xlsx .tiff .jpg 1.6 Nanopore sequencing of the genetic markersFor each genetic marker, a sequencing run will be initiated for (1) seperately barcoded amplicons obtained from a single strain, as well as from (2) a series of complex mock communities. The resulting data will be used to evaluate various sequencing result analyses, to select the best performing targets. Furthermore, the discriminative capacities of the selected genetic markers can be evaluated, together with the efficiency and performance of the primers (PCR bias, sequencing bias, etc.).generate new datadigital experimental.fast5 .pod5 .fastq .fasta .xlsx<5TB WP2: Construction of sequencing data analysis pipelines2.1 Creating a suitable reference sequence database for the selected genetic markersThe selected primers are used to extract gene sequences from publicly available genomes from the NCBI assembly database.

Two main routes are explored here: (1) aligning the sequences to the reference sequence database directly and (2) clustering the sequences into OTUs, after which the sequences are identified. Before the sequences are used, data curation occurs by filtering for qualities of the sequences, their length, as well as the sequences being their intented targets.generate new datadigital experimental .tsv .xlsx<1GB 2.3 Exploring alternative sequence identification strategiesNext to already established sequence identification strategies, the implementation of machine learning techniques will be studied.

A wide range of samples is constructed, and the genomic material obtained from their DNA extraction will be used as template DNA for the PCR reaction, obtaining a DNA library for the Nanopore sequencing runs. generate new data reuse existing dataphysical experimentalvials of genomic DNA, labelled and stored in boxes at - 20°C 3.2 Sequencing the DNA libraries from the spiked water and plant samplesThe resulting amplicons from 3.1 are sequenced, to be used for further analysis of the suitability of the selected genetic markers for pathogen detection.generate new data digital experimental.fast5 .pod5 .fastq .fasta .xlsx<10TB 3.3 Analysis of the sequencing results of the spiked samplesThe optimal sequence identification techniques will be used to evaluate our methods performance on a wide range of samples.
