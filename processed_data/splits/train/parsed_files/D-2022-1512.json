We will characterize HIV particles that enter the nucleus using expansion\nmicroscopy. We will next investigate the role of host transportins 1 & SR2 (TNPO1/TRN-SR2) in\nthe nuclear import of HIV. Different parameters, such as nuclear import efficiency, nuclear\nlocalization, and the HIV integrase (IN) oligomerization state will be measured in T cell lines and\nprimary cells after depletion of transportins or by using an interaction defective mutant of\ntransportin-SR2. Finally, we will study the relationship between integration site selection and HIV\ntranscription and hence HIV persistence. Employing bDNA imaging we will investigate the impact\nof each transportin on integration site selection and transcription. Results may provide novel\nstrategies for a functional cure of HIV infection.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\n1. Analogous data generated : cell lines are stored in cell bank with appropriate registration,\nproteins expressed and purified are stored in protein database of the lab; plasmids will be\nengineered and stored in a plasmid database; primers and antibodies will be commercially\nacquired and stored in respective databases.\n2. Throughout WPs analytical data (PCR data, electrophoresis data, western blot data,\nimmunohistochemistry data, microscopy data) will be initially be collected in a variety of file\nformats mainly Microsoft Excel, MS Word and equipment specific software such as FlowJo for flow\ncytometry data. These files will also be stored in Open Document Format or as CSV files.\nEstimated size 200-300GB.\n3. Digital images (live imaging) will be saved as TIFF files with an estimated volume of 600 GB;\n3.

Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nAll collected digital data (i.e. cell line information, proteomic information, protocols, etc) are and\nwill be stored in an online labmanagement system with integrated Electronic Lab Notebook\nOneNote which runs on a secured and backed up server of KULeuven (managed by ICT of the\nBiomedical Sciences Group). This system also provides a logging system so no data can ever be\nerased, making that everything will be tracable and stored longterm (well beyond the common 5\nyear requirement). Certificates of cell lines and antibodies are stored as well with a link to te\nexperiment. All researchers also keep a paper labbook with annotations of\ndates/experiments/protocols/results/ and references to OneNote labbook and other files/folders\n(imaging data).
