IBD-MAC - DMP title\nProject Identifier\n C3/21/038\nGrant Title\n C3/21/038\nPrincipal Investigator / Researcher\n Gianluca Matteoli\nProject Data Contact\n Gianluca.matteoli@kuleuven.be\nDescription\n The intestinal immune response is tightly regulated to prevent aberrant immune\nactivation towards food antigens and symbiotic microflora, to which the gastrointestinal tract is\ncontinuously exposed. In individuals with a genetic and/or environmental predisposition, this\nregulation is impaired leading to chronic intestinal inflammation, which may result in\nInflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Recent evidence indicates that intestinal macrophages (Macs)\nare gatekeepers of the intestinal immune homeostasis. Consequently, the focus in IBD research\nhas recently shifted from the adaptive immune system towards the study of mucosal innate\nimmune responses, including monocyte/Mac function transitions. In this respect, we have\nidentified various drug candidates for repurposing, as well as a peptide, activating a metabolic\ncheckpoint enzyme, thereby steering Macs toward anti-inflammatory status. In line, our\npreliminary data indicate that the most promising drug significantly decreases IBD readouts in a\nmouse model of colitis. With this C3 project, we aim at establishing solid preclinical datasets as a\nbasis to file (a) patent application(s) and explore licensing opportunities with interested\ncompanies in the IBD domain.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Healthy ileal full-thickness biopsies will\nbe collected during right hemicolectomy for CRC and used as control. Health data such as\ndisease\nseverity and disease status of the collected samples will be recorded.\nSince the animal experiments will take place first, the adjustments to the existing PRET\napplication VLECC/CCARE S53684 are currently ongoing.\n3.2. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s).\nYes.\nAnimal experiments will be performed as part of this project. All animal experiments to be\nperformed in the laboratory of Prof. Gianluca Matteoli have been approved by the Ethical\ncommittee for Animal Experimentation (ECD) at KU Leuven, and are outlined in ECD\nproject P188/2019.\n3.3. Does your research possibly result in research data with potential for tech\ntransfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If\nso, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted?\nYes, we will proceed into patent application filing as soon as possible for data relating to the anti-\ninflammatory efficacy of our selected compounds.\n3.4. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the\ndata you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions regarding\nreuse and sharing are in place?\nNo 3rd party agreements are applicable.\n4. Documentation and metadata\n4.1. What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of the\ndata collected/generated in this project?\nFor every WP (if applicable), the following documentation will be made:\nExperimental design and logbook (.xls)\nProtocols (.docx)\nStructure of data (.docx)\nData analysis (input and output) according to the program used (R, GraphPad Prism, Image\nJ)\nRead me for every WP with the linked folders and locations (.txt)\n4.2. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be\nused. If not, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo.\nText documents and Excel files stored within each experiment folder in the J-Drive will\nrespectively contain guidelines describing data collection/analysis methods and all relevant\nmetadata (including experimental conditions, sample keys, computational analysis pipelines and\ntheir parameters) to ensure the reusability of the data and the reproducibility of any further data\ngeneration.\n5. Data storage and backup during the project\n5.1. Where will the data be stored?\nUpon data collection/pre-processing, copies of the data will be stored in the J-Drive of our\nresearch unit. Temporary copies of the data will be made and kept on personal hard drives.\nPhysical data such as tissue biopsies, (immuno)histologically stained tissue sections, biochemical\nsamples (protein extracts, mRNA) western blots, etc.) will be stored in our freezers/fridges.\nPatient samples will be stored at the UZ/KU Leuven Biobank under the conditions of the\nVLECC/CCARE S53684 protocol.\n5.2. How will the data be backed up?\nData stored on the KU Leuven J-Drive is managed, maintained, and backed up by KU Leuven IT\nservices. Specifically, mirror copies of the stored data are made immediately upon upload for\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 5\nsafety backup purposes\n5.3. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes, the KU Leuven J-Drive has sufficient storage capacity for the outlined project.\n5.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nThe annual cost of J-Drive storage is â‚¬519 per 1TB of storage space per year. This cost and\ncapacity include the performance of mirror copies of the stored data, for safety backup purposes.\nWe expect that 5 TB will be sufficient to store all data generated as part of the project. These\ncosts will be covered by the budget of the project lead (Prof. Gianluca Matteoli).\n5.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not\naccessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nData stored on KU Leuven-managed personal computers are protected via password access to\nthe computers, as set up by the KU Leuven IT Department. Off-site access to J-Drive data is\navailable from KU Leuven personal computers and data access points and is password protected.\nUpon request, access to the shared drive will be given only to authorized researchers.\n6. Data preservation after the end of the project\n6.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the\nproject? If only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is\nthe case (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll raw data will be retained for at least 10 years on the K-Drive storage space. Publication data\nwill be further organized and catalogued on a figure-by-figure basis for future reference to raw\ndatasets used for figure generation\n6.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)?\nLong term data archives will be maintained in specific archive folders on the K-Drive.\n6.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How\nwill the costs be covered?\nThe annual cost of K-Drive storage is 11.384 â‚¬ per 100GB of storage space per year. We expect\nthat 5 TB will be sufficient for long-term storage of all data generated as part of the project.\nThese costs will be covered by the budget of the project lead (Prof. Gianluca Matteoli).\n7. Data sharing and re-use\n7.1. Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data\n(e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions or because of IP\npotential)?\nNo.\nAfter filing patent application(s), there are no factors restricting sharing of the data.\n7.2. Which data will be made available after the end of the project?\nAll data will be made available through publication of articles in established, peer-reviewed\n(nonpredatory) academic journals. Relevant raw data will be made publicly available through\nupload\nto well-established open-access data repositories.\n7.3. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn an Open Access repository\nUpon request by mail\n7.4.
