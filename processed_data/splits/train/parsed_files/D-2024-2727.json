This new type of migrant often faces long-\nterm situations of legal uncertainty, while living in deplorable conditions. It currently remains unclear how domestic law should address this group in a\nhuman rights-compliant manner. This PhD project, which is situated at the intersection of human rights law and migration law, aims to contribute to\nboth the budding international scholarship on non-removable migrants and the current understanding of Belgian migration law. The overarching\nresearch objective is to theorize, analyse and realize the human rights protection of non-removable migrants, specifically in the Belgian legal system.\nFirst, an in-depth understanding of the group of non-removable migrants will be obtained through a detailed categorization exercise. Secondly, the\nprotection offered by human rights (both in theory and in current law) will be delineated in a comprehensive human rights model. Thirdly, Belgian\nmigration law will be evaluated in light of this human rights model, in order to identify gaps in the current legal framework. Finally, recommendations\nwill be formulated based, among others, on an analysis of alternative approaches and comparative research into the German Duldungsstatut and the\nBuitenschuldvergunning in the Netherlands. \nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n24-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
