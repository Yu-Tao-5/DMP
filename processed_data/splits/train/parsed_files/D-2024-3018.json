For the models (Modellica, Python and CFD), a codebook will be included to describe each model (mesh (only for CFD), boundary conditions, user defined functions). Each model will be given an ID number and stored in its own folder accordingly. The output data (i.e., numerical, visual) will be in the same folder and match the same ID number. For the experimental setups, word documents will be created describing the different equipment used and how it was built, the experimental conditions and how the experiments were executed step by step. A logbook will be also created to document important details of the experimental procedures (e.g., dates and time stamps, potential anomalies). This will ensure that the process is reproduceable. Upon execution, each experiment will be given an ID number, and a folder will be created per experiment. The folder will contain the experimental conditions and output measurement data from sensors will match the same ID of experiments.

Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 27 September 2024 4 of 9 No Yes, for models in CFD. For the CFD models generated, MCFD (metadata standard to describe metadata specific to CFD simulations) will be used. It covers aspects such as the simulation domain, grid resolution, boundary conditions, turbulence models, solver settings, convergence criteria, and simulation results. No, for experimental data and Modelica models. For the experiments, an experimental setup Metadata (in the form of a Word document) describing the setup, configuration of the experimental apparatus used to perform the measurements will be used. It will include details such as the equipment used, calibration, environmental conditions and parameters and the steps and sequences of steps performed as well as quality assurance procedures. A data processing and analysis metadata document will be also generated documents the steps involved in processing, analyzing and interpreting the experimental data. For the Modelica models, a codebook will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Data will be stored on the Teams-site of the NudgeFlow project. The virtual testbed will in the test phase be hosted on github.ugent.be from Ghent University and later in the project on protected server room on the HPC of the Building Physics research group at Ghent University (gvo00152). For CFD models from WP1, the data will be stored on Research Drive by SURF (TU Eindhoven). How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Standard back-up provided by the universities. SURF offers disaster recovery, meaning a maximum loss of 24 hours of data Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Maximum storage capacity on Teams-site is 5 TB. SURF has no limitations. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The data stored on the Teams-site can only be accessed by the partners in this VLAIO project. Github.ugent.be will be made accessible for partners in this VLAIO project. SURF allows access only to persons provided with access. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Costs for the shared Teams-site (up to 5 TB) are free for KU Leuven staff. Admission to HPC is free for universities. Eventually extra costs can be covered by the operational budget foreseen in the project. SURF charges about 360 euro per TB per year. Costs will come from the operational budget foreseen in the project. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 27 September 2024 5 of 9 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project 4.
