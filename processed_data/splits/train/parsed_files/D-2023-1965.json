Over the last decades, however, examples of social learning and even long-lasting cultural traditions have been discovered\nthroughout the animal kingdom, not just in vertebrates but even in insects. Bumblebees have emerged as a particularly attractive model\nsystem in this field, having been shown to be capable to learn even abstract and quite complex tasks through social learning. In the\npresent project, I will use bumblebees to address some major outstanding questions in the field of social learning and cultural\ntransmission in insects. Specifically, I will 1) study how social information modulates the exploration of alternative foraging options, i.e.,\nthe exploration-exploitation tradeoff, and 2) test if relatively simple learning mechanisms enable them to display seemingly complex\ncultural transmission biases, such as disproportionally copying either the most common or the most rewarding strategy (conformist &\npayoff-biased transmission). To test these hypotheses, I will make use of innovative robotic flower arrays, which will enable me to\nindividually track all flower visits and allow me to document social learning and cultural diffusion in unprecedented detail.\nLast modified: \n25-04-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be\nused. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nWe will use the metadata standard of the Research data repository that will be chosen at publication, for example Dryad or RDR (by KU Leuven).\n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nDuring and after the research, data will be kept on KU Leuven OneDrive as well as on the lab’s two QNAP NAS systems. Final, analysed data and code will also be published in the KU Leuven\nRDR database upon publication, where it probably will remain indefinitely.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nThe QNAP NAS (Network Attached Storage) is a storage device that provides a centralized and secure way to store, backup, and share data over a network. This way, the data will be backed up\ndaily. \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nMost of the output data of this project will consist of Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files. This is a simple and widely used file format for storing and exchanging data between different software\napplications. Their small file size makes them an efficient option for transferring and storing large datasets. The available storage on the QNAP NAS systems (currently 25.8 TB free space) should\nbe more than sufficient.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nAccess to the physical storage device will be limited to authorized personnel only, as the lab can only be entered by scanning a badge. The QNAP NAS systems use encryption technology and\ncommunicate over a secure connection, which ensures safe storage and prevents unauthorized access.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nAs all data storage systems are already in place at the lab, no costs are expected.\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be\npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\nAll data generated in this project will be preserved on the lab server (QNAP NAS) for at least 10 years.\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 25 April 2023\n6 of 8\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nFor long-term data archiving, repositories such as Dryad or the KU Leuven Research Data Repository (RDR) will be used.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nThere are no costs expected.\n5. Data sharing and reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made\navailable.\nYes, in an Open Access repository\nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.\nNA\nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment\nsection per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nNo\nWhere will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.\nCandidate repositories include the KU Leuven RDR, Dryad or others depending on the journal guidelines upon publishing.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of research results.\nWhich data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why.\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY-4.0)\nDo you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)?
