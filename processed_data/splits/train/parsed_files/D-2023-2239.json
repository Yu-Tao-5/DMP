For structural\napplications, first steps are being made to investigate the use of AM-MLS for weight reduction, and for improving and\ntuning mechanical characteristics such as stiffness, energy absorption, impact resistance, damping or fatigue\nperformance. Multi-functional MLS designed to perform well in several of these areas are at present, however, not\navailable. Also the complex relationships between manufacturing process, unit cell design, parent material, operational\nloading and dynamic behavior of\nsuch lattice structures are not yet well understood. This research project aims at addressing this by unraveling the\nfundamental features that influence the dynamic behavior of MLS. Unique inhouse developed hybrid laser based\nadditive/subtractive manufacturing techniques will be tailored for manufacturing of metal lattice structures with\nimproved and tunable surface characteristics aiming at enhanced impact, fatigue and dynamic material properties. At\nthe same time, the influence of unit cell design, material and operational dynamic loading will be analyzed in detail\nusing multiscale\nsimulations. Input for the simulations and validation cases will\nbe provided by purpose-developed static, fatigue and high strain rate experiments covering material length scales from\nthe lattice struts over, one or multiple, unit cells to solid structural components. \nLast modified: \n02-07-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
