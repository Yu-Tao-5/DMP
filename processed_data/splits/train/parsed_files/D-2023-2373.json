In this way, starting from whole pulse seed material, flours with different ratios of \ncells encapsulating their macronutrients (starch, pr otein) will be produced. We aim to gain insight into how, \ndepending on the intrinsic material properties of the raw pulse seeds, specific flour generation processing \nconditions can be used as an engineering tool to generate (novel) pulse -based flours with desired digestive, \ntechno -functional and sensorial properties for various food applications. For this purpose, we will \nimplement an integrated research approach (i.e. integration throughout the process chain as well as \nintegration of various functionalitie s of the generated pulse -based flours) to better understand (i) the effect \nof the starting pulse seed material (e.g. pulse type and variety, cell wall characteristics, composition), (ii) the \nimpact of various processing conditions during pulse flour genera tion (e.g. cooking time, cooking \ntemperature, cooking medium composition) on the microstructural properties (a.o fractions of broken cells, \nintact cells, cell clusters) of the pulse -based flour and (iii) the impact of these microstructural properties on \nthe digestive, techno -functional and sensory properties of the finished product(s) where these pulse -based \nflours are being used. Such an integrated approach is highly innovative and requires elaborated strategic \nbasic research on the selected pulse types/va rieties as further elaborated in detail in 3.4. In this way, it is \nthe ambition of PulseFlour to reach critical steps forward to comprehensively assess the application \npotential of pulse -based flours for the development of food products with defined and de sired \nfunctionalities and, hence, to better engage the integration of pulses as parts of our healthy and sustainable \ndiets.  \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   3 \n 2.

In this way, starting from whole pulse seed material, flours with different ratios of cells encapsulating their macronutrients (starch, pr otein) will be produced. We aim to gain insight into how, depending on the intrinsic material properties of the raw pulse seeds, specific flour generation processing conditions can be used as an engineering tool to generate (novel) pulse -based flours with desired digestive, techno -functional and sensorial properties for various food applications. For this purpose, we will implement an integrated research approach (i.e. integration throughout the process chain as well as integration of various functionalitie s of the generated pulse -based flours) to better understand (i) the effect of the starting pulse seed material (e.g. pulse type and variety, cell wall characteristics, composition), (ii) the impact of various processing conditions during pulse flour genera tion (e.g. cooking time, cooking temperature, cooking medium composition) on the microstructural properties (a.o fractions of broken cells, intact cells, cell clusters) of the pulse -based flour and (iii) the impact of these microstructural properties on the digestive, techno -functional and sensory properties of the finished product(s) where these pulse -based flours are being used. Such an integrated approach is highly innovative and requires elaborated strategic basic research on the selected pulse types/va rieties as further elaborated in detail in 3.4. In this way, it is the ambition of PulseFlour to reach critical steps forward to comprehensively assess the application potential of pulse -based flours for the development of food products with defined and de sired functionalities and, hence, to better engage the integration of pulses as parts of our healthy and sustainable diets.

Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Physical data: Most raw materials and samples generated during experiments do not need long -term storage, as all analyses need to be performed on fresh or freshly processed samples. If relevant, samples will be stored in freezers or desiccators until the associated data has been published or until the end of the project (end of the associated PhD). For samples that are difficult to regenerate, a longer storage period will be ensured. Digital data: Data will be stored on KU Leuven network drives: - Person al/‘I:’ network drive or OneDrive for Business storage (2 TB available to every PhD researcher – not for strictly confidential or personal data ) for daily personal use and data storage. - Archive/‘K:’ network drive will be used for storage of published da ta.
