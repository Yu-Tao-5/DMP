As a result, these specialised cells\nhave become the targets of intense drug discovery efforts. In melanoma, however, whether CSCs\nexist has remained unclear. Combining single-cell RNA sequencing with in vivo lineage tracing\nand mathematical modelling, we identified a population of melanoma cells that may function as\nCSCs. We propose herein to firmly establish their functional contribution to primary and\nmetastatic growth using genetic lineage tracing and ablation experiments. Importantly, based on\n(our own) recent findings, we hypothesise, that most, if not all, melanoma cells can acquire\nthese â€œdangerousâ€​ CSC properties when exposed to appropriate cues. We therefore also\npropose to define the spatial distribution of this newly identified stem cell population, map their\ncellular niche and identify intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms of tumour-stromal cell interactions\nthat regulate their identity and cell reprogramming ability (i.e. plasticity). We will then test\nwhether pharmacological interventions that target key niche-dependent CSC specification\nmechanisms can restrict tumour growth. This project will pave the way for the development of\ninnovative therapies that contend with, or even exploit, the â€œchameleonicâ€​ behaviour of\ncancer cells. \nWe propose herein to: (i) determine the functional contribution to these putative\nmelanoma CSCs to primary and metastatic growth using genetic lineage tracing and perturbation\nexperiments (i.e. lineage ablation); (ii) dissect the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms\nunderpinning their function(s) and potential reprogramming capacity (i.e. plasticity); (iii) define\ntheir spatial localization, map their cellular niche, identify mechanisms of stromal-tumor cell\ninteractions that involve either direct cell-cell contact and/or secreted ligand-receptor\ninteractions, which impact on the activity of downstream transcription factor(s) (TFs) that, in\nturn, regulate their identity and plasticity; (iv)investigate whether pharmacological interventions\nthat target CSC niche-dependent specification mechanisms can restrict primary and/or\nmetastatic tumor growth.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nStorage of small to intermediate size data is done on the KULeuven J-drive. The J-drive has the\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 8\nbenefit of securing the data with restricted access where necessary and a daily backup system\nwith recorded history that allows the restoration of data in case of accidental\nremoval/modification.\nLarge size data (sequencing data, proteomics data, imaging files) is stored on the KULeuven L-\ndrive. The L-drive has the same characteristics as the J-drive but is especially designed to handle\nlarge data files like sequencing files or imaging files. Total combined storage required for this\nproject is estimated at 50TB. \nWhile the project is ongoing, scripts used to process sequencing files  and their output results are\nsaved in ‘Staging’ HPC cluster storage and locally on personal computers with copies on the J-\ndrive. At the end of a project, only the scripts, important matrices and plots associated with the\nproject will be and all intermediate files will be removed, but can easily be recreated from the\nsaved scripts.\nThe sequencing data generated during the project will either be stored on VIB-KU Leuven servers\nor on the Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC), initially in the staging and archive area, and later\nonly in the archive area (mirrored).\nRaw and processed data will be submitted to a public repository (e.g. EGA) with appropriate\naccess control if required, to enable sharing and long-term validity of the data.\nFresh tissue, single-cell suspensions, nucleic acid samples resulting from (single-cell) nucleic acid\nisolation and sequence library preparations will be stored in in labeled tubes or SBS plates in\nboxes labelled per clinical trial, in -20°C or -80°C freezers purchased by our own funding.\nCryoblocks of tumor tissue will be stored at -20°C, paraffin blocks of tumor tissue will be stored at\nroom temperature.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nKU Leuven drives are automatically (daily) backed up using KU Leuven services according to the\nfollowing scheme:\nData stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all\nincremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups\nare kept.\nData stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly\n(at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept.\nData stored on the digital vault is backed up using snapshot technology, where all\nincremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. As standard, 10% of\nthe requested storage is reserved for backups using the following backup regime: an hourly\nbackup (at 8 a.m., 12 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.), the last 6 of which are kept; a daily backup\n(every day) at midnight, the last 6 of which are kept; and a weekly backup (every week) at\nmidnight between Saturday and Sunday, the last 2 of which are kept.\nIncremental backups are done daily from one 20 TB QNAP NAS to a second 20 TB QNAP\nNAS.\nAll omics data stored on the Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC) will be transferred on a regular\nbasis to the archive area which is backed up.\nData is stored on EGA for the purpose of data sharing.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nStorage space on the J-drive and L-drive are unlimited and can be expanded upon simple\nrequest.\nUpon closure of the project (or intermediately if required), all data will be transferred to the\narchive on the K-drive for long term storage. Data placed on the K-drive is more strictly secured\nwith only very specific members of the lab having the authority to place data on the K-drive and\nonly the head of lab has the authority to have data removed by the IT department.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project?

All folders on the J-drive and L-drive\nare accessible lab members only and can be further restricted in case of sensitive/personal data.\nIn case transportation of the files for home use on non-IT-configured computers or to share with\nexternal collaborators is required, the lab is equipped with encrypted hard drives.\nFor sharing of data with KULeuven internal members, the ICTS supported program BOX will be\nused as an intermediate.\nSequencing data will not be shared with any internal or external collaborators. \n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll digital data will be stored for the expected 10years period.\nOf the physical data only PDX models, (modified) cell lines & DNA vectors (as DNA or glycerol\nstocks) can be cryopreserved in the lab or at the KULeuven biobank for long term storage.\nAll other physical data will be removed over the course of 1- 5years after completion of the\nproject (gDNA, RNA, proteins) due to limited preservation possibilities.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nAs a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing\nplatforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of\npublication or preprint deposition.\nUpon closure of the project, all digital data will be transferred to the archive on the K-drive for\nlong term storage. Data placed on the K-drive is more strictly secured with only very specific\nmembers of the lab having the authority to place data on the K-drive and only the head of lab has\nthe authority to have data removed by the IT department.\nThe physical data in the form of PDX models, (modified) cell lines & mouse tissues will be\ncryopreserved in the lab or at the KULeuven biobank.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nDigital storage on the K-drive is expected to cost 1200 euro per year (at current rates) for 10TB.\nCost of physical storage at the KULeuven Biobank is currently still unclear. Costs of storage will\nbe carried by the labs future grants and VIB dotation.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n6 of 8\n \n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nNo\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nAll sequencing data and code & scripts will be made publicly available.

Personal data will be double coded and no reference\nto subject name will be made. Data will be reused by transfer via Belnet Filesender or secure\ncopy. Sharing policies for specific research outputs are detailed below:\nDouble-coded raw sequencing data (linked to double-coded clinical patient data) will be\ndeposited in open access repositories with restricted access control such as the EBI\nEuropean Genome-phenome Archive (EGA). The EGA is a repository for personally\nidentifiable genetic and phenotypic data. Sequencing data at EGA will only be available\nupon reasonable request via our institutional data access committee and if necessary a\nmaterial transfer agreement will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to describe the\ntypes of reuse that are permitted.\nAll protocols used to generate published data will be described in the corresponding\nmanuscript(s), and the related documentation will be included as supplementary\ninformation. These data and all other documents deposited in the (electronic) notebook are\naccessible to the researchers, and will be made available upon request.\nAll scientific publications will be shared openly.

Legal and ethical issues Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for Research and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). Be aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation. No Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant ethical review committee(s) Yes Utilisation of some GEMMs will be done on ECD already approved P125/2021. PDX and allografts ECDs are currently in writing process before approval by the animal facility of KU-Leuven. Harvesting human samples by TRACE to establish PDX models (prof. Leucci): UZLeuven S63799 Establishing PDX models by implanting tumor fragments (prof. Leucci): KULeuven P164/2019 Any further experimental work on animals or human samples are awaiting approval or an approval request will be submitted before we begin the experiments. Does your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted? Yes We do not exclude that the proposed work could result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorization. As the promoter of this grant is a member of VIB, VIB has a policy to actively monitor research data for such potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of cases the invention will be IP protected (mostly patent protection or copyright protection). As such, the IP protection does not withhold the research data from being made public. In the case, a decision is taken to file a patent application it will be planned so that publications need not be delayed. This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 3 of 8 Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place? No 4. Documentation and metadata What documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this project? All experiments will be performed from an experimental design document (.docx or .xlsx) that details: The hypothesis The different conditions/experimental endpoints The metadata linked to the experiment The link to the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) or published methodology used as protocol. Any experiment-specific changes or optimization will be Any other supporting files (schemes, tables, images, …) or intermediate data output will be stored alongside the data result files Software type, version and analysis type when applicable (e.g. FlowJo for flow cytometry data, R for scripts, qBase+ for (RT-)qPCR analysis, CLC and SnapGene for cloning analysis, etc…) Device settings when applicable and not recorded in the data output (e.g. PCR protocol for (RT-)qPCR) Storage conditions (and location) of physical samples All types of ethical clearance for animal experiments will be stored in dedicated folders on the J- drive. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used. If no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse. Yes For following type of experiments, the below international metadata standards will be used: qPCR: MIQE compliant RDML files will be exported from qBase+ (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19246619) FACS & Flow Cytometry: MiFlowCyt compliant metadata files will be exported from Fortessa & Sony and ARIA Fusion (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18752282) Image metadata will be exported as OME-XML files using Fiji and QuPath software For all other types of experiments no specific metadata standard will be used.

Data storage and backup during the FWO project Where will the data be stored? Storage of small to intermediate size data is done on the KULeuven J-drive. The J-drive has the This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 4 of 8 benefit of securing the data with restricted access where necessary and a daily backup system with recorded history that allows the restoration of data in case of accidental removal/modification. Large size data (sequencing data, proteomics data, imaging files) is stored on the KULeuven L- drive. The L-drive has the same characteristics as the J-drive but is especially designed to handle large data files like sequencing files or imaging files. Total combined storage required for this project is estimated at 50TB. While the project is ongoing, scripts used to process sequencing files and their output results are saved in ‘Staging’ HPC cluster storage and locally on personal computers with copies on the J- drive. At the end of a project, only the scripts, important matrices and plots associated with the project will be and all intermediate files will be removed, but can easily be recreated from the saved scripts. The sequencing data generated during the project will either be stored on VIB-KU Leuven servers or on the Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC), initially in the staging and archive area, and later only in the archive area (mirrored). Raw and processed data will be submitted to a public repository (e.g. EGA) with appropriate access control if required, to enable sharing and long-term validity of the data. Fresh tissue, single-cell suspensions, nucleic acid samples resulting from (single-cell) nucleic acid isolation and sequence library preparations will be stored in in labeled tubes or SBS plates in boxes labelled per clinical trial, in -20°C or -80°C freezers purchased by our own funding. Cryoblocks of tumor tissue will be stored at -20°C, paraffin blocks of tumor tissue will be stored at room temperature. How is backup of the data provided? KU Leuven drives are automatically (daily) backed up using KU Leuven services according to the following scheme: Data stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept. Data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept. Data stored on the digital vault is backed up using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. As standard, 10% of the requested storage is reserved for backups using the following backup regime: an hourly backup (at 8 a.m., 12 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.), the last 6 of which are kept; a daily backup (every day) at midnight, the last 6 of which are kept; and a weekly backup (every week) at midnight between Saturday and Sunday, the last 2 of which are kept. Incremental backups are done daily from one 20 TB QNAP NAS to a second 20 TB QNAP NAS. All omics data stored on the Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC) will be transferred on a regular basis to the archive area which is backed up. Data is stored on EGA for the purpose of data sharing. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Storage space on the J-drive and L-drive are unlimited and can be expanded upon simple request. Upon closure of the project (or intermediately if required), all data will be transferred to the archive on the K-drive for long term storage. Data placed on the K-drive is more strictly secured with only very specific members of the lab having the authority to place data on the K-drive and only the head of lab has the authority to have data removed by the IT department. What are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these costs be covered?

Box (100Gb) Price Free* €51,9 €11,384 €569,2 €10 Period Yearly Yearly Yearly Yearly Conditions Only stored data is charged All space is charged All space is charged All space is charged All expenses for storage are shared among all funded projects in the lab. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? All lab members have access to the university's central servers from their KUL IT-configured computers, either directly on the KUL network or with remote access via Pulse Secure. Access to the drives requires login with personal credentials. All folders on the J-drive and L-drive are accessible lab members only and can be further restricted in case of sensitive/personal data. In case transportation of the files for home use on non-IT-configured computers or to share with external collaborators is required, the lab is equipped with encrypted hard drives. For sharing of data with KULeuven internal members, the ICTS supported program BOX will be used as an intermediate. Sequencing data will not be shared with any internal or external collaborators. 6. Data preservation after the FWO project Which data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...). All digital data will be stored for the expected 10years period. Of the physical data only PDX models, (modified) cell lines & DNA vectors (as DNA or glycerol stocks) can be cryopreserved in the lab or at the KULeuven biobank for long term storage. All other physical data will be removed over the course of 1- 5years after completion of the project (gDNA, RNA, proteins) due to limited preservation possibilities. Where will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)? As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of publication or preprint deposition. Upon closure of the project, all digital data will be transferred to the archive on the K-drive for long term storage. Data placed on the K-drive is more strictly secured with only very specific members of the lab having the authority to place data on the K-drive and only the head of lab has the authority to have data removed by the IT department. The physical data in the form of PDX models, (modified) cell lines & mouse tissues will be cryopreserved in the lab or at the KULeuven biobank. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered? Digital storage on the K-drive is expected to cost 1200 euro per year (at current rates) for 10TB. Cost of physical storage at the KULeuven Biobank is currently still unclear. Costs of storage will be carried by the labs future grants and VIB dotation. This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 6 of 8 7. Data sharing and reuse Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? No Which data will be made available after the end of the project? All sequencing data and code & scripts will be made publicly available. Other data can be made available upon request. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? In an Open Access repository Other (specify): Whenever possible, datasets and appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. Personal data will be double coded and no reference to subject name will be made. Data will be reused by transfer via Belnet Filesender or secure copy. Sharing policies for specific research outputs are detailed below: Double-coded raw sequencing data (linked to double-coded clinical patient data) will be deposited in open access repositories with restricted access control such as the EBI European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA). The EGA is a repository for personally identifiable genetic and phenotypic data. Sequencing data at EGA will only be available upon reasonable request via our institutional data access committee and if necessary a material transfer agreement will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to describe the types of reuse that are permitted. All protocols used to generate published data will be described in the corresponding manuscript(s), and the related documentation will be included as supplementary information. These data and all other documents deposited in the (electronic) notebook are accessible to the researchers, and will be made available upon request. All scientific publications will be shared openly. Manuscripts submitted for publication will be deposited in a pre-print server such as bioRxiv. At the time of publication, research results will be summarized on the institutional website (https://www.vibcancer.be) and post-print pdf versions of publications will be made available there if allowed by copyright agreements, possibly after an embargo as determined by the publisher. Before the end of the embargo or in cases where sharing the post-print is not allowed due to copyright agreements, a pre-print version of the manuscript will be made available. (Pre-print) publications will also be automatically added to our institutional repository, Lirias 2.0, based on the authors name and ORCID ID. All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software tools driving the project will be described in manuscripts and/or on GitHub (https://github.com) accompanied by a README.txt file containing all the associated information and/or on our interactive webserver (http://blueprint.lambrechtslab.org). Extra data that do not support publication will be either deposited in an open access repository or made available upon request by email. When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results As a general rule all research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at the time of publication (or preprint deposition). No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, potential IP requirements – note that patent application filing will be planned so that publications do not need to be delayed – or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be made publicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? The full dataset of sequencing experiments and the codes & scripts used for their analysis will be uploaded in their respective databases as an open access dataset under a CC-BY license. Therefore, it will be available to anyone for any purpose, provided that they give appropriate credit to the creators. This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 7 of 8 All other data can be made available upon request by mail after signing an MTA. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered? Costs of data sharing are minimal (<100euro/year) and will be financed by the lab. 8.
