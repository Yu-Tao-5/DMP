The questions and\nhypotheses that I address are: 1) If during this period there is a crisis of the viceregal court system of government,\nanalyzing the retinues and households of the viceroys. 2) If the loss of the liberality of the offices of justice and\ngovernment by the viceroys was decisive in the conformation of a political rearticulation of the kingdoms of the\nIndies, moving from a government governed by criteria of domestic economy to another of political economy. 3) If\nduring this period a turning point began in which the Spanish Crown began to administer the American kingdoms\nas a colonial system. -The purpose for which the data is collected and created is of a purely scientific nature,\ndedicated exclusively to the analysis of whether or not there was a change in the imperial government of the\nSpanish Monarchy. \nAll these data will allow us not only to establish a correct analysis of the imperial government\nin the distance through the servants and servants of the viceroys, as well as the officials who ruled in Spanish\nAmerica, but also if there was the decomposition of the court system as a way to govern the overseas empires and\nthat was giving rise to the nation-states that we know today.This is the fundamental reason for the creation of this\ndata plan.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. General Information\nName applicant\nJuan Jiménez Castillo\nFWO Project Number & Title\n12ZV522N:\n Viceregal Houses, Power, Articulation. The Origins of Political-Economic Government in the Kingdom of\nPerú in a time of incertainty (1675-1725)\nAffiliation\nKU Leuven\nMy affiliation is with the KU Leuven, Faculty of Arts, Department of Modern History. My director for this postdoctoral\nproject is Professor Werner Thomas.\n2. Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nReuse existing data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume.\nThis may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and per WP or objective of the project.\nIf you reuse existing data, specify the source of these data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of\ncontent) from data formats (the technical format).\n1. As the main WP of the project I will use existing data available in print or digital format (text editions, articles,\nbooks, library catalogues, online databases, etc.). Likewise, for documentation extracted from archives,\ndocumentation will be transcribed into Word documents and Excel tables, as well as hand-collected notes in\npersonal notebooks. Together with the photographs and photocopies, they will be automatically saved in the KU\nLeuven's Onedrive archive on my personal computer.\n2. International archival sources, such as Peruvian archives, will be consulted in Lima during a research stay. My\ntask will be to transcribe the documentation, as well as to make photocopies and archive photographs, which will\nbe saved on my personal computer and on KU Leuven's OneDrive. The bibliography and exhibition catalogues\nconsulted and purchased with the project budget will become part of the KU Leuven library collection.\n3. Most of the documentation in Spanish and European libraries is digitised, so there is hardly any need to travel.\nThe calculation of the weight of the documentation is complex to calculate, as it depends on the development of\ndigitisation in each library. I will mainly consult the Biblioteca Digital Hispánica and the Biblioteca Nacional de\nChile, both with numerous digitised works. For them, their public use and downloading does not require\ncertification or rights protection of any kind, so there will be no problems. As for the National Library of Peru, I have\nconsulted numerous works during my doctoral thesis, which will help me to carry out this project, although the\nnew works I consult will be digitised and incorporated into our documentary folders held at the KU Leuven.\n4. The incorporation of maps are digitised in the section of the Archivo de Indias, \"Maps\". The weight of each\ndocument will depend on the level of scanning, although they are usually quite heavy.\n5. The graphics and client power networks will not be very heavy, as processors such as Excel, GHIS-INDIAS and\nONODO will be applied, which are simple to use, but of great visualisation for the understanding of the main\nresults.\n6\n. \nThe following chart clarifies the procedures for the data collected and generated:\n \nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 5\n \nType of data\nFormat \n Volume\nHow created? \nTranscription of archival\ndocuments.\nFile formats:\nMainly docx\nRough estimate of data size:\n50MB\nSoftware and methods:\nMicrosoft Word, Excel tables\nand individual folders to\nseparate documentary\nsections.\nDigital manuscripts\nPdf format\n10GB\nPDF\nPhotographs, photocopies\nand scans of archival\ndocumentation\nJpg and pdf format\n10GB\nPhotos taken on site and\nphotocopies requested from\nthe archive.\nDigitized cartographic maps\nand prints\nPdf format\n10GB\nPDF download\nHandwritten notes in a\npersonal notebook.\nDocx and paper format\n1GB\nObservations taken on site\n3. Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add the\nreference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for Research and Public Service\nPurposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a\nlegal obligation.\nNo\nPrivacy Registry Reference:\nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used:\nThe only data to be used will be from people who died more than 300 years ago.\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on\nhumans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant ethical\nreview committee(s)\nNo\nNo\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? Will\nIP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions will be\nasserted?\nNo\nNo, except for the copyrights from my research papers in journals and books.\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If so,\nto what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo. In the case of documentation from the General Archive of the Nation of Peru, there are no restrictions or\nconditions of use, except for the payment of documentary rights for its scientific dissemination, as is the general\nrule in most state archives.\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this project?\n1. The main data will be reported in scientific papers to be published in high impact journals.\n2. A README file will be created, containing relevant and specific information for all files in each folder. It will\nincorporate the following aspects: a) the set and origin of the data and information extracted from archives and\nlibraries; b) the file references extracted; c) folders and labels indicating the content of the files analyzed; d)\nreference to the specific locations and variables defining the source of the documentation; e) structural\ninformation for the data set (whether they are tables, maps, transcription, etc.); f) the confidentiality of the data,\nlicenses and legal conditions for its reuse; g) the software used for the data, the licenses and legal conditions for its\nreuse; h) the software used for the data, the licenses and the legal conditions for its reuse. ); f) confidentiality of\nthe data, licenses and legal conditions for its reuse; g) the software used to process and open the documentation;\nh) main instruments used for the scope of the data generated.\n3. The collected information and data will be dumped in easy-to-use and open-access databases for the scientific-\nhistorical world. One of them is ONODO to create personal networks to analyse the constitution of viceregal power.\nAnother is HGIS de las Indias, for analysing and downloading maps extracted from the archive, allowing us to\nunderstand the new vertebration of the Americas. The digital photos and microfilms will be stored by city,\nlibrary/archive and number. Anyone will be able to consult the data extracted from the research, as it is open\naccess.\n4. The tables created during the research using processors such as Excel will be incorporated in the scientific works\n(articles, book chapters), which will allow a permanent and open location.\n5. The documentation digitised for the project from archives (such as the Archivo General de Indias), as well as\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 5\nfrom other national libraries, have a copyright that prohibits its public use, allowing these institutions only its\nscientific use, for research work and projects.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be used. \nIf no, state in\ndetail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nNo metadata standard will be used.\nHowever, it should be noted that the tables and folders contained in the repository (Onedrive) of the KU Leuven,\ncontains a search system that allows us to easily locate any information relating to all the folders included\nthroughout the research. The same can be done in my laptot, where I will store documentary copies, and where\nthe documents can be located, as well as specific data to facilitate the research, as well as to make the project\nitself and the researcher more visible, closer and more informative.\nThe answer to the second question is implied in the last answer \"4\". However, I must comment on the following\npoints:\n1. To indicate that the documentation will be collected in folders that I will file in my work computer in order to be\nincorporated in the databases, as well as in the scientific work that will be carried out.\n2. The documentation will be collected in separate folders according to the archives and libraries consulted. In\neach of these folders, the documentation collected will be incorporated, with the official code number and\nnomenclature that each archive and library maintains, as indicated by the standards established by official\nscientific historical research.\n3. The coherence and quality of the data collected will be in accordance with the transcription standards used by\nhistorical science, in order to adhere faithfully to the original documentation.\n4. The results of this research in the form of articles and/or book chapters will be peer-reviewed in order to meet\nthe standards of scientific quality applied to the historical sciences.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\n1. The main copy will be stored on two main devices. On the one hand, in the digital archive of the department of\nEarly Modern History of the KU Leuven (Onedrive), on my personal work computer, from where the first copy of\ndocumentation will be obtained and exported to other personal digital devices, in order not to lose the\ndocumentation.\n2. Given that the documentation is of a historical nature and does not involve any damage to third parties, this\ndocumentation will be used so that any colleague in the department who has research projects related to my\nproject can make use of this data. Likewise, this storage will enable the department of Early Modern History and, in\ngeneral, the Faculty of Arts of the KU Leuven, to become a substantial source of information for the History of\nAmerica once the project is completed.\n3. Finally, being in contact in the department with other researchers who maintain projects associated with my\ntimeframe, we will use OneDrive for the transfer of information on both sides, in order to improve the results of our\nwork, as well as to open up new lines of research previously unknown.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\n1. All documentation will be incorporated into KU Leuven's digital services (Onedrive), which allows for regular\nautomatic copying, in order to ensure the best possible safekeeping of the documentation.\n2. The microfilms of maps can be downloaded directly from the web portal of the Spanish archives (PARES) and\nincorporated into the services of the KU Leuven, after payment of fees to the General Archive of the Indies.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If\nno or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will be taken care\nof.\nNo\n1. There is currently no data storage problem, as most of the documentation will be transcribed into Word\ndocuments. The capacity of such documentation, although ample, is not large enough to cause problems in the\nfuture. In consultation with the ICT of the KU Leuven, there is sufficient space for the storage of documents\ndigitised and downloaded during the project. If necessary, part of the project budget would be incorporated into\nthis data storage.\n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these costs be\ncovered?\n1. Storage costs in this respect will be minimal, as the digital facilities of the Faculty of Arts of the KU Leuven will be\nused, as well as the devices (computers, computer keys, etc.) that will allow us to store the documentation. Should\nan increase in costs be necessary in this respect, a larger amount will be allocated to data storage than the 4,000\neuros per year that this project has for overhead costs.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by\nunauthorized persons?\n1. The analysed (transcribed) documentation will only be consulted by the members of the project, and will be kept\nby the storage facilities of the Faculty of Arts of the KU Leuven.\n2. The mapping and digitised documentation can not be modified.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 5\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a\nselection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual\nrestrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\n1. The main data generated by the project will be accessible in the form of scientific articles and book chapters in\ninternational journals and publishers open to the public and the scientific community. They will also be accessible\nthrough LIRIAS, open to the scientific community of KU Leuven.\n2. The databases and personal archives collected during the years of the research project will be stored on the\nservers of the KU Leuven (Onedrive) for a short-term period. After the end of the project, the relevant data will be\nkept for a minimum of 10 years in a safe, secure and sustainable manner for reproducibility, verification and\npossible reuse, as stated in the KU Leuven RMD Policy, as well as in published scientific papers. For long-term\ncustody I will be able to use two systems: a) the RDR repository of the KU Leuven, a platform to upload, describe\nand share my research data in an accessible and convenient way, with the support of the University staff. Here I\nwill be able to securely archive project data upon completion and increase the impact of the research, as well as\nenhance that of others, which costs €100/500GB, or 20 cents/GB per year; b) download and use an open-access\nacademic data repository.\n3. Bibliography will be made available to the humanities library at the Faculty of Arts of the KU Leuven.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\n1. The data generated as well as the main research results will be stored at KU Leuven, as well as at the Faculty of\nArts and the LIRIAS platform, as indicated in the previous answer.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will\nthe costs be covered?\n1. The cost of data preservation is hardly a cost that can be taken into account. Most of the documentation will be\nincorporated in articles and book chapters that will be openly accessible through LIRIAS. Likewise, the possible\nmicrofilm, as well as the cartography, will not be of large capacity, so the storage cost for KU Leuven is minimal. In\nany case, the custody of this data will also be kept in the department of Modern History of the Faculty of Arts,\nwhich has a budget associated with it. In the hypothetical case that this would be necessary, the budget could be\nreadjusted.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an\nagreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nNo\nNo. Data and information from state archives and libraries may be disseminated with prior permission from their\narchives and images. In the case of extracting information, images (tables, plans, maps, etc.) from private archives\nand libraries, I would refer to the impossibility or not of transferring the rights of such documentation.\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\n1. Most of the data will be made available in the form of articles and book chapters accessible to the public through\nLIRIAS.\n2. The documentation incorporated into the ONODO and HGIS databases will be permanently registered. Likewise,\nall this information will be offered to the Spanish-American archives and, mainly, to the General Archive of the\nIndies, in order to be a useful tool for future researchers.\n3. Mainly, the data used in the project will be collected in the RDR platforms of the KU Leuven (indicated in point\n6.1), as well as in an open access academic repository, in which to offer in a simple, informative and open way to\nthe scientific community the main data and sources collected, in order to make the project and the research, as\nwell as the researcher, better known.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn an Open Access repository\nUpon request by mail\n1. Scientific articles and book chapters in international journals and publishers will be open access digitally and in\nthe LIRIAS platform of the KU Leuven and in the Spanish repository DIALNET.\n2. Data (documentation, maps, and digitised information) will be posted on platforms such as ONODO, HGIS, and\nthe KU Leuven storage repository RDR.\n3. In case any international researchers are not familiar with KU Leuven's databases or storage, they can always\nconsult the project work through the Academia.edu dissemination platform, as well as send an email to the\nprincipal investigator.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nImmediately after the end of the project\nAfter finishing the WPs.\nLikewise, once the various articles and scientific papers have been published, a large amount of data will be\npermanently open.\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 5\nCf. 7.3.\nAs indicated in answer 7.3, the data will be made available to the general public and to all international\nresearchers through the platforms and databases ONODO, HGIS, DIALNET, LIRIAS, Academia.edu, etc., in addition\nto the KU Leuven repository. Its use will be allowed as long as it is for research and scientific dissemination\npurposes.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nThe cost for dissemination and data sharing is not significant, as we will take advantage of already created\ndatabases that feed on information from other projects. Likewise, the scientific results of the project will be\ndisseminated through university scientific platforms (LIRIAS), scientific journals and publishers. KU Leuven itself will\npromote the use of this type of data and documentation collected.\n8. Responsibilities\nWho will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?\nThe principal researcher:\nWP1: Juan Jiménez Castillo\nAnd the supervisor/director of the postdoctoral project:\nWP2: Werner Thomas\nWho will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nThe principal researcher:\nWP1: Juan Jiménez Castillo\nAnd the supervisor/director of the postdoctoral project:\nWP2: Werner Thomas\nWho will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ?\nThe principal researcher:\nWP1: Juan Jiménez Castillo\nAnd the supervisor/director of the postdoctoral project:\nWP2: Werner Thomas\nWho bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nJuan Jiménez Castillo\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n5 of 5"

The Origins of Political-Economic Government in the Kingdom of Perú in a time of incertainty (1675-1725) Affiliation KU Leuven My affiliation is with the KU Leuven, Faculty of Arts, Department of Modern History. My director for this postdoctoral project is Professor Werner Thomas. 2. Data description Will you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data? Generate new data Reuse existing data Describe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and per WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of these data. Distinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the technical format). 1. As the main WP of the project I will use existing data available in print or digital format (text editions, articles, books, library catalogues, online databases, etc.). Likewise, for documentation extracted from archives, documentation will be transcribed into Word documents and Excel tables, as well as hand-collected notes in personal notebooks. Together with the photographs and photocopies, they will be automatically saved in the KU Leuven's Onedrive archive on my personal computer. 2. International archival sources, such as Peruvian archives, will be consulted in Lima during a research stay. My task will be to transcribe the documentation, as well as to make photocopies and archive photographs, which will be saved on my personal computer and on KU Leuven's OneDrive. The bibliography and exhibition catalogues consulted and purchased with the project budget will become part of the KU Leuven library collection. 3. Most of the documentation in Spanish and European libraries is digitised, so there is hardly any need to travel. The calculation of the weight of the documentation is complex to calculate, as it depends on the development of digitisation in each library. I will mainly consult the Biblioteca Digital Hispánica and the Biblioteca Nacional de Chile, both with numerous digitised works. For them, their public use and downloading does not require certification or rights protection of any kind, so there will be no problems. As for the National Library of Peru, I have consulted numerous works during my doctoral thesis, which will help me to carry out this project, although the new works I consult will be digitised and incorporated into our documentary folders held at the KU Leuven. 4. The incorporation of maps are digitised in the section of the Archivo de Indias, \"Maps\". The weight of each document will depend on the level of scanning, although they are usually quite heavy. 5. The graphics and client power networks will not be very heavy, as processors such as Excel, GHIS-INDIAS and ONODO will be applied, which are simple to use, but of great visualisation for the understanding of the main results. 6 .

Be aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation. No Privacy Registry Reference: Short description of the kind of personal data that will be used: The only data to be used will be from people who died more than 300 years ago. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant ethical review committee(s) No No Does your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted? No No, except for the copyrights from my research papers in journals and books. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place? No. In the case of documentation from the General Archive of the Nation of Peru, there are no restrictions or conditions of use, except for the payment of documentary rights for its scientific dissemination, as is the general rule in most state archives. 4. Documentation and metadata What documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this project? 1. The main data will be reported in scientific papers to be published in high impact journals. 2. A README file will be created, containing relevant and specific information for all files in each folder. It will incorporate the following aspects: a) the set and origin of the data and information extracted from archives and libraries; b) the file references extracted; c) folders and labels indicating the content of the files analyzed; d) reference to the specific locations and variables defining the source of the documentation; e) structural information for the data set (whether they are tables, maps, transcription, etc.); f) the confidentiality of the data, licenses and legal conditions for its reuse; g) the software used for the data, the licenses and legal conditions for its reuse; h) the software used for the data, the licenses and the legal conditions for its reuse. ); f) confidentiality of the data, licenses and legal conditions for its reuse; g) the software used to process and open the documentation; h) main instruments used for the scope of the data generated. 3. The collected information and data will be dumped in easy-to-use and open-access databases for the scientific- historical world. One of them is ONODO to create personal networks to analyse the constitution of viceregal power. Another is HGIS de las Indias, for analysing and downloading maps extracted from the archive, allowing us to understand the new vertebration of the Americas. The digital photos and microfilms will be stored by city, library/archive and number. Anyone will be able to consult the data extracted from the research, as it is open access. 4. The tables created during the research using processors such as Excel will be incorporated in the scientific works (articles, book chapters), which will allow a permanent and open location. 5. The documentation digitised for the project from archives (such as the Archivo General de Indias), as well as This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 2 of 5 from other national libraries, have a copyright that prohibits its public use, allowing these institutions only its scientific use, for research work and projects. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used. If no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse. No No metadata standard will be used. However, it should be noted that the tables and folders contained in the repository (Onedrive) of the KU Leuven, contains a search system that allows us to easily locate any information relating to all the folders included throughout the research. The same can be done in my laptot, where I will store documentary copies, and where the documents can be located, as well as specific data to facilitate the research, as well as to make the project itself and the researcher more visible, closer and more informative. The answer to the second question is implied in the last answer \"4\". However, I must comment on the following points: 1. To indicate that the documentation will be collected in folders that I will file in my work computer in order to be incorporated in the databases, as well as in the scientific work that will be carried out. 2. The documentation will be collected in separate folders according to the archives and libraries consulted. In each of these folders, the documentation collected will be incorporated, with the official code number and nomenclature that each archive and library maintains, as indicated by the standards established by official scientific historical research. 3. The coherence and quality of the data collected will be in accordance with the transcription standards used by historical science, in order to adhere faithfully to the original documentation. 4. The results of this research in the form of articles and/or book chapters will be peer-reviewed in order to meet the standards of scientific quality applied to the historical sciences. 5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project Where will the data be stored? 1. The main copy will be stored on two main devices. On the one hand, in the digital archive of the department of Early Modern History of the KU Leuven (Onedrive), on my personal work computer, from where the first copy of documentation will be obtained and exported to other personal digital devices, in order not to lose the documentation. 2. Given that the documentation is of a historical nature and does not involve any damage to third parties, this documentation will be used so that any colleague in the department who has research projects related to my project can make use of this data. Likewise, this storage will enable the department of Early Modern History and, in general, the Faculty of Arts of the KU Leuven, to become a substantial source of information for the History of America once the project is completed. 3. Finally, being in contact in the department with other researchers who maintain projects associated with my timeframe, we will use OneDrive for the transfer of information on both sides, in order to improve the results of our work, as well as to open up new lines of research previously unknown. How is backup of the data provided? 1. All documentation will be incorporated into KU Leuven's digital services (Onedrive), which allows for regular automatic copying, in order to ensure the best possible safekeeping of the documentation. 2. The microfilms of maps can be downloaded directly from the web portal of the Spanish archives (PARES) and incorporated into the services of the KU Leuven, after payment of fees to the General Archive of the Indies. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will be taken care of. No 1. There is currently no data storage problem, as most of the documentation will be transcribed into Word documents. The capacity of such documentation, although ample, is not large enough to cause problems in the future. In consultation with the ICT of the KU Leuven, there is sufficient space for the storage of documents digitised and downloaded during the project. If necessary, part of the project budget would be incorporated into this data storage. What are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these costs be covered? 1. Storage costs in this respect will be minimal, as the digital facilities of the Faculty of Arts of the KU Leuven will be used, as well as the devices (computers, computer keys, etc.) that will allow us to store the documentation. Should an increase in costs be necessary in this respect, a larger amount will be allocated to data storage than the 4,000 euros per year that this project has for overhead costs. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? 1. The analysed (transcribed) documentation will only be consulted by the members of the project, and will be kept by the storage facilities of the Faculty of Arts of the KU Leuven. 2. The mapping and digitised documentation can not be modified. This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 3 of 5 6. Data preservation after the FWO project Which data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...). 1. The main data generated by the project will be accessible in the form of scientific articles and book chapters in international journals and publishers open to the public and the scientific community. They will also be accessible through LIRIAS, open to the scientific community of KU Leuven. 2. The databases and personal archives collected during the years of the research project will be stored on the servers of the KU Leuven (Onedrive) for a short-term period. After the end of the project, the relevant data will be kept for a minimum of 10 years in a safe, secure and sustainable manner for reproducibility, verification and possible reuse, as stated in the KU Leuven RMD Policy, as well as in published scientific papers. For long-term custody I will be able to use two systems: a) the RDR repository of the KU Leuven, a platform to upload, describe and share my research data in an accessible and convenient way, with the support of the University staff. Here I will be able to securely archive project data upon completion and increase the impact of the research, as well as enhance that of others, which costs €100/500GB, or 20 cents/GB per year; b) download and use an open-access academic data repository. 3. Bibliography will be made available to the humanities library at the Faculty of Arts of the KU Leuven. Where will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)? 1. The data generated as well as the main research results will be stored at KU Leuven, as well as at the Faculty of Arts and the LIRIAS platform, as indicated in the previous answer. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered? 1. The cost of data preservation is hardly a cost that can be taken into account. Most of the documentation will be incorporated in articles and book chapters that will be openly accessible through LIRIAS. Likewise, the possible microfilm, as well as the cartography, will not be of large capacity, so the storage cost for KU Leuven is minimal. In any case, the custody of this data will also be kept in the department of Modern History of the Faculty of Arts, which has a budget associated with it. In the hypothetical case that this would be necessary, the budget could be readjusted. 7. Data sharing and reuse Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? No No. Data and information from state archives and libraries may be disseminated with prior permission from their archives and images. In the case of extracting information, images (tables, plans, maps, etc.) from private archives and libraries, I would refer to the impossibility or not of transferring the rights of such documentation. Which data will be made available after the end of the project? 1. Most of the data will be made available in the form of articles and book chapters accessible to the public through LIRIAS. 2. The documentation incorporated into the ONODO and HGIS databases will be permanently registered. Likewise, all this information will be offered to the Spanish-American archives and, mainly, to the General Archive of the Indies, in order to be a useful tool for future researchers. 3. Mainly, the data used in the project will be collected in the RDR platforms of the KU Leuven (indicated in point 6.1), as well as in an open access academic repository, in which to offer in a simple, informative and open way to the scientific community the main data and sources collected, in order to make the project and the research, as well as the researcher, better known. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? In an Open Access repository Upon request by mail 1. Scientific articles and book chapters in international journals and publishers will be open access digitally and in the LIRIAS platform of the KU Leuven and in the Spanish repository DIALNET. 2. Data (documentation, maps, and digitised information) will be posted on platforms such as ONODO, HGIS, and the KU Leuven storage repository RDR. 3. In case any international researchers are not familiar with KU Leuven's databases or storage, they can always consult the project work through the Academia.edu dissemination platform, as well as send an email to the principal investigator. When will the data be made available? Immediately after the end of the project After finishing the WPs. Likewise, once the various articles and scientific papers have been published, a large amount of data will be permanently open. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 4 of 5 Cf. 7.3. As indicated in answer 7.3, the data will be made available to the general public and to all international researchers through the platforms and databases ONODO, HGIS, DIALNET, LIRIAS, Academia.edu, etc., in addition to the KU Leuven repository. Its use will be allowed as long as it is for research and scientific dissemination purposes. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered? The cost for dissemination and data sharing is not significant, as we will take advantage of already created databases that feed on information from other projects. Likewise, the scientific results of the project will be disseminated through university scientific platforms (LIRIAS), scientific journals and publishers. KU Leuven itself will promote the use of this type of data and documentation collected. 8. Responsibilities Who will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?
