While such approaches have been shown to\nhave huge potential, most of this work is targeted to ML experts. Little work has been done to\nsupport such human-in-the-loop approaches for non-expert users, i.e. users with little or no ML\nknowledge. In addition, existing approaches for non-expert users mostly focus on rather simple\nML models that are easy to explain. The objectives of this project are threefold: first, we will\nresearch how existing model-agnostic explanation methods can be extended with interaction\ncapabilities to capture feedback of non-expert users. Second, we will research how feedback\nelicited with these mixed-initiative explanation can be incorporated in ML models. Third, we will\nresearch which mixed-initiative explanation methods work better for particular user groups and\nhow they can be personalised. By researching the effectiveness of different mixed-initiative\nexplanation methods from a Human-Computer Interaction perspective, and using model-agnostic\nexplanation methods to capture user feedback, we aim to provide a generic framework that can\nbe used to incorporate user feedback in a range of ML models, including more complex deep\nlearning models.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
