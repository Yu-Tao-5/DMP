By helping to\nbetter understand whether and how depoliticization and politicization are related, this project breaks new ground by allowing it to assess the potential\nconsequences of different behavioral constellations for policymaking processes and outcomes. In this way, it can shed light on strategic\n(communicative, procedural) behaviors/practices that are usually informal in nature, but nevertheless capable of shaping decision-making processes,\nnamely by exposing or shielding them from polarization, salience and mobilization. Consequently, it has concrete policy implications that can lead to\ngreater awareness of the implications of different strategies, especially in terms of policy support/acceptance.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n13-03-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
