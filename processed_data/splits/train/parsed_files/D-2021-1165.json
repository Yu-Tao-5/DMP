The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but\nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\n1.General Information\nName applicant Thomas Ceulemans\nFWO Project Number & Title FWO project number: 1166722N\nProbabilistically modelling the birth and death of stars: changing\nthe game with fast and precise emulation-enabled radiative\ncooling\nAffiliation x KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent\n☐ Universiteit Hasselt \n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel\n☐ Other: \n2.Data description\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 1\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make\nuse of existing data? x Generate new data\nx Reuse existing data\nDescribe the origin, type and format of the data \n(per dataset) and its (estimated) volume\nIf you reuse existing data, specify the source of these\ndata. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from \ndata formats (the technical format).A new solver (self-written, c++ code, <1GB)\nBenchmarks of the new solver (generated, test results, <1GB)\nMachine learning dataset (generated, dataset, ~100GB)\nMachine learning model (trained on dataset, neural network, <1 GB)\nStellar wind models (reuse of Institute of Astronomy models, numerical model, ?
