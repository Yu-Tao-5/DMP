Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Locally on my laptop. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9 How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS , STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL A ND NON -DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH .7 REFER TO INSTITUTION -SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE . The data will be backed up automatically and continuously to https://onedrive.kuleuven.be/ Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: I can store up to 2048 GB on onedrive.kuleuven.be, which is more than sufficient for the whole project. If no, please specify : How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 7 The backup (onedrive.kuleuven.be) is consi dered secure enough to be used by KU Leuven and the provided security is deemed sufficient for this project. Access to the data is restricted to a per -invitation basis. Access to the primary data (on my laptop) is limited to me personally through physical access + a un ique PIN code that is not to be shared with anyone. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10 What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the resear ch project? How will these costs be covered? Since the project is only concerned with a small amount of data, there will be no costs except for the laptop (covered by FWO fellowship ) and the costs borne by KU Leuven to provide the OneDrive storage space. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). All final versions of the data sets listed in the table under 2 above will be retained for at least five years. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? The generated data sets will be archived in KU Leuven’s Research Data Repository . If calculational detai ls are provided in Mathematica notebooks, these will be stored on the open -access preprint repository arXiv as ancillary files to the corresponding publications . What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? KU Leuven’s Research Data Repository is managed centrally by the KU Leuven . No funding from the current project is required to cover this. arXiv is managed by Cornell University and does not charge the researchers to store data. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILA BLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY . AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS . FOR MORE INFORMATION : HTTPS ://WIKI.SURFNET .NL/DISPLAY /STANDARDS /INFO-EU- REPO /#INFOEUREPO -ACCESS RIGHTS ☒ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☐ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify : Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. The generated datasets will be made available through KU Leuven’s Research Data Repository and relevant Mathematica notebooks through arXiv (see above). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12 When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS ’. Upon publication of the results. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDE R WHAT CONDITIONS . IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED , THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED . DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT . EXAMPLE ANSWER : E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS .” 8 Data from the project will be made available under the CC -BY 4.0 license . Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here . INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIF IER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA . ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes: DOIs are generated automatically for arXiv submission s (which might include Mathematica notebooks as ancillary files) and also for KU Leuven Research Data Repository datasets. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? There is no cost associated to making the data available at neither arXiv nor KU Leuven’s Research Data Repository , other than the time required to prepare the f iles, write the associated documentation etc. This time cost will be borne jointly be the PI and collaborators. 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13 7.
