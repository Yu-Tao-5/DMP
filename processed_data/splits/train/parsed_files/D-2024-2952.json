No The research is algorithm-oriented. The code will be shared according to the standards in our field. Typically, our algorithms are implemented in python and will then be shared in the the form of an easily installable python package. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Software will be developed in KU Leuven GitLab or private GitHub repositories Datasets will be stored either on the gitlab repositories or the NetApp-based storage solution at the Dept. of Computer Science (KU Leuven). How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? GitLab and the NetApp-based storage system have secure backups that are automatically stored at a second location at KU Leuven, so loss of data is minimized. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Only authorized users can access the NetApp-based storage, GitLab repositories and private GitHub repositories. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? All storage and backup costs are covered by the project budget. After the project has ended, the costs will be covered by the DTAI research group. 4.
