The metadata can be exported as a .csv file. For the interview documentation, the questions/topics list, consent forms and information letters will be provided. A .pdf file can be produced for these documents. As for the documentation that will contain the key characteristics of the interview participants and the interview date, time and location, they will be stored on a secure, password-protected MS Excel (.xlsx) file. For the analysed interview data, a codebook and readme.txt will be provided. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.

STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.‚òí Yes ‚òê No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: When necessary, the research will use the Dublin Core metadata standard. If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? All the data that do not contain any personal or private information of the researcher and the participants (i.e., journal articles, desk research notes, interview questions, information letters, publication materials, pseudonymized transcripts and interview analyses) will be stored in the researcher's KU Leuven OneDrive account. The data that may contain personal and private information will be stored in a secure KU Leuven managed storage, specifically a Sharepoint On-Premise Site. Access to the site will be purchased as soon as the first interview data is generated. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.The data will be stored on OneDrive for Business. KU Leuven ICTS protects and manages the accounts used. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.‚òí Yes ‚òê No If yes, please specify concisely: The data will consist of video, audio and pdf forms. It is projected that the data that do not contain personal data and the videos can be stored in the 2TB storage that comes from the KU Leuven's OneDrive cloud storage, which is free for staff and students of KU Leuven. The videos and those that have personal data will be stored in the SharePoint Online-Site which is free for KU Leuven staff and offers 5TB of storage. If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7Only the researcher (Julius Porqueri√±o) has access to the files that contain personal data and interview videos. KU Leuven for Business allows for multifactor authentication to protect access to strictly confidential data. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?OneDrive is free for students and staff at KU Leuven, and the SharePoint online-site is free for KU Leuven staff. In the unlikely event that additional storage space is required, the researcher's FWO bench fee will be used to cover the costs. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).The KU Leuven policy for data management will be followed, meaning data must be preserved for ten years, following the RDM policy of KU Leuven. The data that will be stored are: the transcribed and pseudonymised interviews (.docx, .pdf), the analysis through NVivo (.nvp), and the researcher's notes (.docx, .md). Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?The data will be archived via the OneDrive account managed by KU Leuven for at least 10 years. Data that will contain personal and private information will be deleted once the research project is done. Only the analyzed and pseudonymized interview data, and other important data gathered during the research will be kept. As such, these will be stored with promoter (Prof. Annemie Dillen) for at least 10 years. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?There are no expected costs for data storage. OneDrive for business is free for staff and students of KU Leuven. However, in the event that a paid service is necessary to store data during the retention period, the bench fee of the researcher will be used. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 136. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available.

Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS.

Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.‚òê Yes ‚òí No If yes: What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? There are no expected costs for many of the data repositories. However, in the event that a paid service is necessary to share data, the bench fee of the researcher will be used. 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 157.
