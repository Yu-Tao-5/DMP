        "full_text": "FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   1 \n FWO DMP  Template - Flemish Standard Data Management Plan   \n \nProject supervisors (from application round 2018 onwards) and fellows (from application round 2020 onwards) will, upon being awarded their project or fellowship, be invited to develop their answers to the data management related questions into a DMP. The F WO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official  start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO \nbut to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel.  Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.  \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. T his \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives  of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contai ns the core \nrequirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link\n.  \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   2 \n 1.

I will use neutrophil -specific PAD4 \nknockout mice, with a proven cardioprotective phenotype  in aging , to study NET -mediated mechanisms of \ncardiac aging. Single nucleus transcriptomics will generate non -biased gene expression profiles of heart \ntissue cells in aging upon PAD4 deficiency. Afterwards, the interaction between NETs and a ffected cell \ntypes and pathways will be validated in in vitro experiments. Finally, we will characterize the immune \nresponse in the hearts of aged mice to an acute stressor to identify factors that increase vulnerability of the aged heart. This could advance our mechanistic insight in immune related mediators of cardiac aging, thereby providing new opportunities to reduce the burden of CVD and improve quality of life in the elderly.  \n \n \n     \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   4 \n 2.

    "clean_full_text": "FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 1 FWO DMP Template - Flemish Standard Data Management Plan Project supervisors (from application round 2018 onwards) and fellows (from application round 2020 onwards) will, upon being awarded their project or fellowship, be invited to develop their answers to the data management related questions into a DMP. The F WO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. T his Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contai ns the core requirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link .

I will use neutrophil -specific PAD4 knockout mice, with a proven cardioprotective phenotype in aging , to study NET -mediated mechanisms of cardiac aging. Single nucleus transcriptomics will generate non -biased gene expression profiles of heart tissue cells in aging upon PAD4 deficiency. Afterwards, the interaction between NETs and a ffected cell types and pathways will be validated in in vitro experiments. Finally, we will characterize the immune response in the hearts of aged mice to an acute stressor to identify factors that increase vulnerability of the aged heart. This could advance our mechanistic insight in immune related mediators of cardiac aging, thereby providing new opportunities to reduce the burden of CVD and improve quality of life in the elderly.
