Besides regularly provided automated backups by ICTS (of J -drive, K -drive), the data stored on personal PCs , \npersonal KUL SharePo int and J -drive will be back -up on external hard disks. External SSD hard -disks (up to \n12 TB storage capacity) keep the storage costs feasible.  \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or  insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.  ☒ Yes \n☐ No \nIf no, please specify : Yes. The lab of experimental radiotherapy shares a shared drive with the lab of \nexperimental oncology. The J -drive  has a capacity 400GB, the K -drive has a capacity 500GB. Extensions of \nthis volume can be asked for at ICTS for an additional cost. We have currently several external hard disks \n(12TB, 5TB, 1TB capacities). Same for liquid nitrogen tanks or freezers, but s ufficient capacity is currently \navailable.  \n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template   6 \n What are the expected costs for data storage and \nbackup during the project? How will these costs \nbe covered?  \n \nAlthough FWO has no earmarked budget at its \ndisposal to support correct research data \nmanagement, FWO allows for part of the allocated \nproject budget  to be used to cover the cost incurred.  Currently the expenses for the shared drives are covered by the shared budgets of the labs. The external \nhard disks on lab budget are available . Extra data storage can be covered by the FWO budget .  \nData security: how will you ensure that the data \nare securely stored and not accessed or modified \nby unauthorized person s?  Clinical and imaging data will be available in electronic patient files (KWS) of the UZ Leuven and will only be \navailable to the involved researchers by passwords. The archives and SharePoint  both KUL/UZ Leuven  will \nbe available to the involved researc her by passwords.  \n \n6.

In case \nonly a selection of the data can/will be \npreserved, clearly state the reasons  for this \n(legal or contractual restrictions, physical \npreservation issues, ...).  Generated data will be preserved, raw and processed, for at least 5 years.  \nUnpublished data from unfinished work will be kept for longer than 5 years since there is a possibility to use \nin publications.  The final delineation tool will be made public after  consultation and advice from the \nUniversity Research and Development Office . \nWhere will these data be archived (= stored for \nthe long term)?  K-drive and external SSD hard disks.  \n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template   7 \n What are the expected costs for data \npreservation during these 5 years? How will the \ncosts be covered?   \n \nAlthough FWO has no earmarked budget at its \ndisposal to support correct research data \nmanagement, FWO allows for part of the allocated \nproject budget  to be used to cover the cost incurred.

Should there \nbe any additional expenses, it will be funded by the FWO Bench Fee.  \n \n1. Data sharing and reuse  \n \nAre there any factors restricting or preventing \nthe sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined \nin an agreement with a 3rd party, legal \nrestrictions)?  ☒ Yes \n☐ No \nIf yes, please specify : Data sharing will occur through publications (open access policy). The planned \ndepositions of data in the relevant responsible repositories will occur after publication. We do not plan to \nshare any unpublished data.  Delays to the above data sharing policy may only arise through IPR. We will \nseek advice from the University Research and Development Office . This consultation will take place prior to \nany publication or disclosure of results.  \nWhich data will be made available after the end \nof the project?
