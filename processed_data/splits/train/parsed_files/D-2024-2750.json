From an engineering perspective, it is intriguing how the bacterial colonies\nshape their surroundings to provide protection from external influences (mechanical/chemical\nstress). On the other hand, the biofilm needs to be structured in such way that bacteria can move\nduring its formation and nutrients can reach the bacteria. In many applications, such as wound\nhealing, food production and industrial fouling, biofilms are undesired. However, biofilms are of\ngrowing interest as a positive instrument in biotechnical applications including bioremediation,\nbiofertilization and energy production. The goal of this project is to gain a mechanistic understanding\nof the internal functioning and morphology of biofilms. To do this, I will investigate the biofilm matrix\nand its hierarchical porous structure using optical and mechanical techniques. Also the kinetics of\nbiofilm formation, the transport phenomena inside biofilms and bacterial motility in biofilms will be\ninvestigated. This mechanistic view of biofilm functioning is novel, and I believe the newly generated\ninsights will contribute to methodologies and principles for design and engineering of biofilms. This\nwill allow optimization of existing applications and will lay the groundwork for invention of new\npositive applications of biofilms, contributing in the end to the sustainability of our society.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n29-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
