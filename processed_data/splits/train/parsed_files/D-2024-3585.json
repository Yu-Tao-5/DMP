Eerder onderzoek toonde aan dat metacognitieve monitoring zich bij kinderen ontwikkelt van\neen domein-specifieke tot een domein-algemene vaardigheid en dat deze verandering zich voordoet tijdens de lagere school. Het is\nechter nog niet duidelijk wanneer deze overgang specifiek plaatsvindt en welke mechanismen hier onderliggend aan zijn. Dit\nonderzoeksproject richt zich daarom op de ontwikkeling van metacognitieve monitoring en heeft als doel deze overgang te bestuderen in\nkinderen van verschillende (lagere school)leeftijden en te achterhalen in welke mate deze ontwikkelingen gestuurd worden door\neducatieve en/of maturationele processen. Kinderen van het tweede tot het vijfde leerjaar zullen longitudinaal onderzocht worden via\n(academische) gedragstaken. Praktisch informeert dit onderzoek ons over het soort interventies (specifiek vs. algemene) en de timing\nervan om metacognitieve vaardigheden op school te stimuleren.\nID: \nID: \n211742\nStart date: \nStart date: \n27-11-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n30-09-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n23-12-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
