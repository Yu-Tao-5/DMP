An \neasy-to-follow hierarchy will be used, and folder names will be descriptive. Main folders are kept for each \nresearcher (e.g. Data Roger). Subfolders will be used, with broader topics at higher levels. For example:  \nData Roger  ‘Mouse model’ - project (e.g. Ocn-Cre;Vhl  High fat diet). Next, subfolders will be created \naccording to type of data (e.g. histology, flow cytometry, qPCR,)… Within each type of data folder, \ndescriptive subfolders will be created depending on type of data (e.g. histology  subfolders ‘H&E \nstaining’, ‘TRAP staining’,.. in which the raw and processed data will be stored; e.g. H&E stainings \nsubfolders ‘Adipocyte counting’, ‘ROI cropped’, ‘ROI’, …  in which the raw and processed data will be \nstored). As mentioned above, mice log lists, protocols and metadata regarding data acquisition will be \nstored on the shared drive, such that they are easily accessible for all lab members.\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 65.Data storage & backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?  Data will be kept on the internally shared and secured backed-up drives of KU Leuven (long-term: L drive, \nshort-term: J drive). Moreover, copies of the data will be stored on working personal computers hard \ndrives, a temporary copy in OneDrive cloud, and a backup copy in an external hard drive.\nHow will the data be backed up?  The data is stored on the central server of KU Leuven, and in an external hard drive.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.  ☒ Yes\nCurrently there is sufficient storage in the Long-term KU Leuven server drive and in the back up external \nhard drives. Additional capacity can be reserved at any time, and additional working hard drives and back \nup hard drives will be purchased when needed.  \n☐ No\nIf no, please specify:  \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the project? How will these \ncosts be covered? \nAlthough FWO has no earmarked budget at its \ndisposal to support correct research data \nmanagement, FWO allows for part of the allocated \nproject budget to be used to cover the cost incurred.€800/year for data storage on the KU Leuven server (electronic files) and temperature-controlled storage \nsites (fridges, freezers, ultra-freezers -80°C, liquid N 2) (biological samples).  \nPurchase of back up hard drives (4T, €300).\nPurchase of working SSD drives (4T, €600).\nPurchase of freezers has been done before from preceding grants to the PI; costs for repair are occasional.\nThese costs will be covered by the PI (FWO and KU Leuven grants) and/or my FWO bench-fee.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data \nare securely stored and not accessed or \nmodified by unauthorized persons?  Shared drives KU Leuven: Access is only given to authorized researchers associated to the lab.\nPersonal hard drives: Hard drives are stored in the lab at any time, and accessible only to lab members\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 76.Data preservation after the end of the FWO project\nFWO expects that data generated during the project are retained for a period of minimally 5 years after the end of the project, in as far as legal and  \ncontractual agreements allow.\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 \nyear period after the end of the project? In case \nonly a selection of the data can/will be \npreserved, clearly state the reasons  for this \n(legal or contractual restrictions, physical \npreservation issues, ...).All data will be retained for at least the expected 5-year period after finalization of the project. After that, \nprof. Christa Maes will decide on what data will be retained. In principle, all key raw and analyzed data are \npreserved for 10 years or undetermined time after the project. Data or samples deemed uninformative or \nof no further value for research purposes (e.g., quality loss from biological samples) may be discarded \nafter the 5- or 10-year period.\nWhere will these data be archived (= stored for \nthe long term)? Data will be stored on the KU Leuven shared drive (L-drive) or transferred to the KU Leuven data \nrepository (K-drive). Additionally, a copy of all data will be kept on the personal hard drives, which will be \nhandled over to prof. Christa Maes after finalization of the project.\nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during these 5 years?

Any other data can be made available upon reasonable \nrequest after publishing the key results of the project.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for \nreuse? ☒ In an Open Access repository\n☐ In a restricted access repository\n☒ Upon request by mail\n☐ Other (specify):\nWhen will the data be made available?  After publishing the key results of the project.  \nWho will be able to access the data and under \nwhat conditions? Only uses for research and educational purposes will be allowed; commercial reuse will be excluded.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? \nHow will these costs be covered?  \nAlthough FWO has no earmarked budget at its \ndisposal to support correct research data \nmanagement, FWO allows for part of the allocated \nproject budget to be used to cover the cost incurred.Data sharing is generally not associated with costs. Data are shared either via public repositories (free for \ndepositing and users) or via email or free-of-costs data sharing services (e.g., Belnet, OneDrive).  \n8.Responsibilities\nWho will be responsible for the data \ndocumentation & metadata?
