Whilst documented positive \nconsequences for both\nemployees and organizations, practice and policy are still unsure about how to successfully\nmanage teleworking such that it enhances employee performance and scientific research\nremains inconclusive about how telework affects individual efficiency and effectiveness. We\nclaim that a disregarded though highly relevant factor is the nature of the tasks carried out while\nteleworking. This research project aims at unraveling the telework-performance relationship,\nusing a task-related approach based on work design theory. In a first study, we examine which\ntasks (e.g. complex) are best performed at home (compared to at the office) and how task-work\nlocation interactions affect employeesâ€™ task performance. In a second study, we assess how\ndaily communication exerts influence \non performance amongst teleworkers. A third study then\nuses an intervention to assess how daily and weekly work design, i.e. a combination of task\ncharacteristics at home and at the office, affects both daily and weekly performance. Findings\npromise to contribute to the topical telework literature and both practice and policy struggling\nwith managing teleworkers. Data for these quantitative studies are collected by using experience\nsampling (study 1), event sampling (study 2) and weekly and daily diary studies (study 3).\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nThis research project consists of three studies. For each study, new data will be generated using\ndiary surveys. The experience sampling method (study 1) and event sampling method (study 2)\nare implemented to collect data. In the third study, we will use daily and weekly diary surveys.\nData is collected via surveys conducted either via participants’ phones (using an online research\napp, i.e., Expiwell) or via e-mail while using Qualtrics. Each study contains of data from both pilot\nand official studies in Excel and SPSS, and separated files with (potential) candidates’ e-mail\naddresses.\nFor the first study, data from two pilot studies are already collected and stored.

Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nYes\nYes. In each study, will use (potential) participants’ e-mail addresses as a key to combine\ndatasets from different days in the same study with one another and to contact them regarding\nthe practicalities of the data collections.\nThis DMP will include information on how I plan to safeguard this personal data throughout each\nstudy and after the end of this project.\nThe reference from the accepted PRET application is; G-2021-3769.\nDescription of the personal data:\nE-mail addresses are collected during each study in order to contact both potential and\ninterested participants after the study and to combine multiple datasets.\nThe data collection for the first study goes as follows: after filling out a demographic\nquestionnaire in August 2020, which was part of an earlier data collection of my promoter,\nemployees of VDAB were asked whether they wanted to participate in the first (diary) study. If\nthey agreed, they were voluntarily asked to fill in their \ne-mail addresses\n, so that they can be\ncontacted afterwards about several practicalities involving the data collection. Data for the\nfollowing studies are collected in a similar manner. Hence, respondents' e-mail addresses are the\nonly personal data that is collected in this research project, and they are stored in a separate\nfile. Those e-mail addresses will be stored on the secure Y-drive of the Faculty of Economics and\nBusiness, KU Leuven, which is a central storage that only the primary researcher has access to.\nParticipants in each study can also indicate whether they are interested in the results of the\nstudy by filling in their e-mail addresses, and that data is stored and secured in a similar manner.\nAfter the studies, e-mail addresses will be deleted since they no longer serve us a purpose. From\nthat point on, data are thus anonymized. During the actual data collection (i.e., not contacting or\ncollecting participants) in Expiwell, data are already anonymized because participants log in on\nthe mobile application with their own profile, using an anonymous link that was sent by the\nprincipal researcher of this project. Therefore, we do not know which participant is filling in the\nquestionnaires and no datafile exists that includes a key to link the answers with participants.   \nDuring each study, we will also collect \nsociodemographic data\n. Examples are age, sex,\nfunction, tenure, number of children living at home, highest educational degree, and working\nregime.\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 6\nYes\nYes, reference to ethical committee approval (PRET application): G-2021-3769\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nFor each data collection in study 1-3, an xlsx file of the used scales and instructions is prepared\nby the researcher and reviewed by the promoters of this project. These files include the\ntypologies of questions, the codes that were given to the variables in the datasets, the\nreferences of the original source of the variables and their response categories and variables.\nDuring and after each study, the files are also stored on the OneDrive and X-drive of KU Leuven,\nrespectively. The X-drive is a KUL storage that only WOS-researchers have access to (i.e., the\ndepartment of the involved researchers at KUL).\nFurthermore, each step in the analyses and methodology (e.g., data cleaning, recoding variables,\netc.) undertaken by the researcher is documented either via codes or syntax files, so that\nreplication and reviews are possible.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nThe datafiles generated from either Qualtrics or Expiwell include metadata (e.g., date, number of\nsurvey, time, location, etc.) and are analyzed and recoded in SPSS. The formats of both platforms\nare used during this study, for convenience purposes. More specifically, the xlsx files downloaded\nfrom both Qualtrics or Expiwell already include the metadata for each file and these are stored\non the KUL X-drive. The metadata files for the surveys will be stored as .xlsx files during the\nproject and csv files afterward.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nDuring each study, data is stored on the secured OneDrive of KU Leuven. Datafiles are only\nshared with researchers involved in and during this project.\nAfter each study, our research data will be stored on the secure X-drive of the Faculty of\nEconomics and Business, KU Leuven, which is a central storage that only the primary researcher\n(Jonas De Kerf) and his KUL promotor (Rein De Cooman) have access to. These network drives\nhave enough capacity for the data that I plan to collect during this project. These separated and\nsecured X-drive files are back-up on a daily basis. After 10 years, the research data will be\ndeleted, in line with the FEB and FWO guidelines.\nThe researcher (Jonas De Kerf) will only have access to the personal data, whilst both his\npromotors (Rein De Cooman and Sara De Gieter) and other researchers/collaborators will have\naccess to the \nanonymized\n data in OneDrive.\nMaster’s students are also used to collect and analyze data, although they will only have access\nto the \nanonymized\n data in SPSS.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nKU Leuven’s central servers have automatic daily back-up procedures and are used as back-up\nstorage during each study. Furthermore, the professional and secured OneDrive account of the\nresearcher is used during every study, which has an automatic back-up procedure as well.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 6\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThe OneDrive of KUL is used during each study, and the Y-drive when each study is finished. The\nstorage locations of the WOS department have been used extensively in the past and proved\nnumerous times to have enough capacity.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nAlthough no costs are expected while storing the data, since this service is free for KUL\npersonnel, unexpected costs can be covered by the bench fee provided by FWO.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nAccess to data, as well as reading and editing rights, are restricted to a limited number of\nauthenticated persons (i.e. the principal researcher and promoters), based on security groups\nmanaged and audited through a web interface by the researcher himself. Access to the web\ninterface is controlled through a Shibboleth authentication process. Access from other devices or\naccess without proper access authorization is prevented by a combination of system and storage\naccess control, encryption and firewalling of the systems involved.\nOnly the PhD student and his KUL promotor (Rein De Cooman) have access to the long-term data\nstorages after each study in the secured X-Drive. On the primary investigator’s personal Y-drive,\nthe personal e-mail addresses are stored. When these personal datafiles have no further purpose\n(e.g., after contacting respondents or combining datafiles), e-mail addresses are deleted.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nOnly the datafiles that are eventually used for the analyses in the research studies are retained,\nso other scholars could verify or replicate the results when necessary or requested. Also the data\nthat was collected during pilot studies is stored for the expected 10 years, in case the PhD\nresearcher would prefer to carry out extra analyses or use the data for additional purposes (e.g.,\nverifying other hypotheses, providing an example during teaching courses, etc.).\nDatafiles with personal data (i.e., the e-mail addresses) are deleted as soon as they are no longer\nrequired.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nA separate archive is made on the secured KUL X-drive when the PhD researcher finishes a study\nto store the data for the longer term (i.e., the required 10 years).\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nNo costs are expected while storing the data, since this service is free for KUL personnel.\nNonetheless, unexpected costs can be carried by the FWO bench fee.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nNo\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nWe plan to provide our anonymized data on which the analyses of each study are based in an\nopen access repository. However, if possible, only for a limited duration (10 years).\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn an Open Access repository\nThe anonymized datasets with documentation will be available through the \nOpen Science\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n5 of 6\nFramework\n, on my public profile.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nThe Open Science Framework works with licenses, which we possibly will use to avoid our data\nbeing used for commercial ends or modified by unauthorized people.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nWe do not expect costs for data sharing. The OSF is a free service, managed and maintained by\nthe Center for Open Science.\n8.

This DMP will include information on how I plan to safeguard this personal data throughout each study and after the end of this project. The reference from the accepted PRET application is; G-2021-3769. Description of the personal data: E-mail addresses are collected during each study in order to contact both potential and interested participants after the study and to combine multiple datasets. The data collection for the first study goes as follows: after filling out a demographic questionnaire in August 2020, which was part of an earlier data collection of my promoter, employees of VDAB were asked whether they wanted to participate in the first (diary) study. If they agreed, they were voluntarily asked to fill in their e-mail addresses , so that they can be contacted afterwards about several practicalities involving the data collection. Data for the following studies are collected in a similar manner. Hence, respondents' e-mail addresses are the only personal data that is collected in this research project, and they are stored in a separate file. Those e-mail addresses will be stored on the secure Y-drive of the Faculty of Economics and Business, KU Leuven, which is a central storage that only the primary researcher has access to. Participants in each study can also indicate whether they are interested in the results of the study by filling in their e-mail addresses, and that data is stored and secured in a similar manner. After the studies, e-mail addresses will be deleted since they no longer serve us a purpose. From that point on, data are thus anonymized.

Documentation and metadata What documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this project? For each data collection in study 1-3, an xlsx file of the used scales and instructions is prepared by the researcher and reviewed by the promoters of this project. These files include the typologies of questions, the codes that were given to the variables in the datasets, the references of the original source of the variables and their response categories and variables. During and after each study, the files are also stored on the OneDrive and X-drive of KU Leuven, respectively. The X-drive is a KUL storage that only WOS-researchers have access to (i.e., the department of the involved researchers at KUL). Furthermore, each step in the analyses and methodology (e.g., data cleaning, recoding variables, etc.) undertaken by the researcher is documented either via codes or syntax files, so that replication and reviews are possible. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used. If no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse. No The datafiles generated from either Qualtrics or Expiwell include metadata (e.g., date, number of survey, time, location, etc.) and are analyzed and recoded in SPSS. The formats of both platforms are used during this study, for convenience purposes. More specifically, the xlsx files downloaded from both Qualtrics or Expiwell already include the metadata for each file and these are stored on the KUL X-drive. The metadata files for the surveys will be stored as .xlsx files during the project and csv files afterward. 5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project Where will the data be stored? During each study, data is stored on the secured OneDrive of KU Leuven. Datafiles are only shared with researchers involved in and during this project. After each study, our research data will be stored on the secure X-drive of the Faculty of Economics and Business, KU Leuven, which is a central storage that only the primary researcher (Jonas De Kerf) and his KUL promotor (Rein De Cooman) have access to. These network drives have enough capacity for the data that I plan to collect during this project. These separated and secured X-drive files are back-up on a daily basis. After 10 years, the research data will be deleted, in line with the FEB and FWO guidelines. The researcher (Jonas De Kerf) will only have access to the personal data, whilst both his promotors (Rein De Cooman and Sara De Gieter) and other researchers/collaborators will have access to the anonymized data in OneDrive. Master’s students are also used to collect and analyze data, although they will only have access to the anonymized data in SPSS. How is backup of the data provided? KU Leuven’s central servers have automatic daily back-up procedures and are used as back-up storage during each study. Furthermore, the professional and secured OneDrive account of the researcher is used during every study, which has an automatic back-up procedure as well. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 4 of 6 Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.

On the primary investigator’s personal Y-drive, the personal e-mail addresses are stored. When these personal datafiles have no further purpose (e.g., after contacting respondents or combining datafiles), e-mail addresses are deleted. 6. Data preservation after the FWO project Which data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).

A separate archive is made on the secured KUL X-drive when the PhD researcher finishes a study to store the data for the longer term (i.e., the required 10 years). What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered? No costs are expected while storing the data, since this service is free for KUL personnel. Nonetheless, unexpected costs can be carried by the FWO bench fee. 7. Data sharing and reuse Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? No Which data will be made available after the end of the project? We plan to provide our anonymized data on which the analyses of each study are based in an open access repository. However, if possible, only for a limited duration (10 years). Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? In an Open Access repository The anonymized datasets with documentation will be available through the Open Science This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 5 of 6 Framework , on my public profile. When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? The Open Science Framework works with licenses, which we possibly will use to avoid our data being used for commercial ends or modified by unauthorized people. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered? We do not expect costs for data sharing. The OSF is a free service, managed and maintained by the Center for Open Science. 8. Responsibilities Who will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?
