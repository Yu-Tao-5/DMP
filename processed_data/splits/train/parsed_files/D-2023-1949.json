How \nwill these costs be covered?The   total   estimated   cost   of   data   storage   during   the\nproject is  81,000 EUR. This estimation is based on the\nfollowing costs:\n- The costs of digital data storage are as follows:\n128,39€/TB/Year   for   the  “L-drive”   and\n519EUR/TB/Year for the “J-drive”.\n- The cost of VSC archive is 70 EUR/TB/Year, and\nstaging 130EUR/TB/Year.\n- We expect costs to drop slightly during the coming\nfour years. Additional budget for compute and data\nstorage is budgeted for in ongoing projects, and will\nbe costed in complementary project applications.\n5.

STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: GEO requires metadata under the MINSEQE standard when submitting sequencing data. Additionally we will make it clear which cells are annotated with each sex and cell type as we believe this is important for reanalysis by others If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Digital files will be stored on KU Leuven servers or on the Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC). Upon publication, sequencing data will be submitted to GEO and code submitted to github. All data will also be archived on KU Leuven servers or the VSC. Data Management Plan for 11I1523N 10How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.KU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme: - data stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept. - data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept. - All omics data stored on the Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC) will be transferred on a monthly basis to the archive area which is mirrored 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ Data Management Plan for 11I1523N 11Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: There is sufficient storage and back-up capacity on all KU Leuven servers: - the “L-drive” is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster with NetApp series storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front-end. - the “J-drive” is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controllers with an Ontap 9.1P9 operating system. - the Staging and Archive on VSC are also sufficiently scalable (petabyte scale) If no, please specify: If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7Both the VSC and KU Leuven servers require 2 factor authentication to access. Additionally, the work computers used to access these files are stored in a locked cabinet in a locked office. Data Management Plan for 11I1523N 12What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?The total estimated cost of data storage during the project is 81,000 EUR. This estimation is based on the following costs: - The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 128,39€/TB/Year for the “L-drive” and 519EUR/TB/Year for the “J-drive”. - The cost of VSC archive is 70 EUR/TB/Year, and staging 130EUR/TB/Year. - We expect costs to drop slightly during the coming four years. Additional budget for compute and data storage is budgeted for in ongoing projects, and will be costed in complementary project applications. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All sequencing and imaging data will be preserved locally for at least five years after publication. Those submitted to public repositories should be available indefinitely. Data Management Plan for 11I1523N 13Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?Sequencing data will be archived on the VSC and on GEO. Imaging data will be archived on the KU Leuven servers What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?As mentioned above, archival costs are in the range of 70-130 euros per TB per year. These costs will be covered through grants and ongoing projects. Data Management Plan for 11I1523N 146. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☐ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.The data will be published in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Data Management Plan for 11I1523N 15When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.Data will be made available upon publication Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes: 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ Data Management Plan for 11I1523N 16What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? GEO is funded by the NIH and is free to host our data. 7. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project?The award holder (Sam van Knippenberg) will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project?The award holder will manage data storage and back-up. Who will manage data preservation and sharing?The award holder will ensure that the data is preserved and publicly available at the end of the project.
