The project aims to\nanswer questions about the space of all such structures, similar to ones asked about the spaces of symplectic, Poisson and complex structures, such as-\nwhat is its local structure? What can we say about its homotopy/cohomology groups? Is it endowed with some additional structure over it?\n \nOne of the common methods to study spaces of geometric structures is deformation theory. Taking a geometric structure, which corresponds to a point\nin the space of all structures, and deforming it, is equivalent to finding nearby points in the space of all structures. The deformation theory of Dirac\nstructures is well known, and when a given Dirac structure admits a second Dirac structure which complements it in a certain way, the problem of\ndeforming it becomes a bit simpler. Therefore one of the main first objectives of the project is answering which Dirac structures admit such a\ncomplement. \nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n10-05-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
