Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). All source code files generated in the project (hardware, firmware , data analysis) will include comments to aid readability and interpretation. They will be accompanied by README files that explain their structure and dependencies . For hardware and firmwar e files, the README will additionally include c ompilation instructions and/or scripts to facilitate its (re)use . The power measurements files will be stored as CSV files consisting of a series of sequential bytes, where each byte corresponds to a sampl e in the time series. They will be accompanied by a README file detailing the acquisition settings of the measurement (FPGA model, clock frequency of design, sampling frequency of oscilloscope) and Python scripts to load the data. If relevant , the input data associated to the measurement will be provided also a s CSV file. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If n ot, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: The measurement data will be stored in CSV format . We are not aware of any metadata standard for power measurements, so we will ensure the format ting of our data is described in detail. 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Source code files will be stored in a Gitlab repository with access control hosted and managed by KU Leuven ICTS . In a later phase, after the publication of the research article concerned, the relevant source codes will be made available in a public Github repository. The measurement data wi ll be stored in KU Leuven OneDrive for Business, as it is not suited to version - controlled systems such as Gitlab. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10 How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS , STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON -DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH .7 REFER TO INSTITUTION -SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE . Both storage options ( Gitlab and OneDrive) as available through KU Leuven ICTS have adequate backup strategies in place . Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: The default Gitlab repository storage capacity of 1 GB is sufficient to store and backup all source files generated by the project. For the measurement files, the default 2TB storage capacity of OneDrive for Business is sufficient as well. If no, please specify : How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 7 The proj ect will not use or store any personal data. Nevertheless, both the Gitlab repository and OneDrive for Business storage have access control mechanisms to ensure secure storage behind proper authentication. Only members of the research team will have access to the stored data. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11 What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? There are no costs expected for d ata storage and backup , as we do not see a need for additional storage beyond what is already covered by the service offered by KU Leuven ICTS. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). All data will be retained for 10 years after the end of the project , in lines with the KU Leuven RDM policy. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for t he long -term)? Data will be archived using the Server File Storage hosted in the KU Leuven ICTS data centers. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The expected cost for the volume of data for 10 years is below 1000 EUR and will be covered by the project supervisor. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILA BLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY . AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS . FOR MORE INFORMATION : HTTPS ://WIKI.SURFNET .NL/DISPLAY /STANDARDS /INFO-EU- REPO /#INFOEUREPO -ACCESS RIGHTS ☒ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☐ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: A selection of the source codes necessary to the reproduce project results will be made available via Github. Measurem ent data can be made available upon request if necessary. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. N/A Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data ( e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify : Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. The data necessary to reproduce project results will be made availab le via Github. Additional measurement data can be provided upon request. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13 When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS ’. Data will be made available a fter publication of the research results Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS . IF NO LICENCE IS GRAN TED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED . DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT . EXAMPLE ANSWER : E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJEC T THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS .” 8 The source code s will be provided under a permissive license (MIT or Apache) allowing maximum reuse. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here . INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNI QUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes: What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? No costs are expected for sharing the data. 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14 7.
