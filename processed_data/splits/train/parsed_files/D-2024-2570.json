The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Dieter Stiers, 0000-0001-7242-8477\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles\nProject number 1 & title Resurrecting Turnout, Saving Democracy?\nFunder(s) GrantID 212A1Z24N\nAffiliation(s) X KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\nPlease provide a short project description While there is high public support for electoral democracy worldwide, electoral turnout has been decreasing  \nstrongly in the past decades. This apparent contradiction leads to inequality between who turns out and who  \ndoes not, and it also likely lowers people’s perceptions of the legitimacy of elections. It is therefore  \nunsurprising that political researchers and practitioners have looked for ways to increase turnout, but so far  \nwe know very little about the broader effects of these interventions. This project has as its main aim to  \ninvestigate the effects of interventions to increase turnout on people’s political attitudes and behaviour, and  \non their perception of the legitimacy of the electoral result. I rely on a unique electoral situation that  \npresents itself in 2024 in Belgium in which two Election Days are held in the same year, each time presenting  \na new electoral rule, to examine the effects of lowering the voting age to 16 years old and compulsory voting  \non people’s political attitudes using a more compelling design than previous research. I also include two  \nnovel conjoint experiments to investigate the effect of (interventions to increase) turnout on perceptions of  \nthe legitimacy of elections. Taken together, this project will reveal whether declining levels of turnout  \nendanger the stability of representative democratic systems, and the extent to which interventions to  \nincrease turnout affect the legitimacy of elections.\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.
