Sustainability from a climate and an ecological point of view asks for livestock that is converting (for humans non digestible)\nplant resources into high value animal proteins in the most efficient way. In this respect, enormous achievements have been realized,\nboth in the optimization of management as well as in the genetic improvement of the animals. In pigs (Pietrain) as well as in beef cattle\n(Belgian Blue), Belgian breeds are globally amongst the most efficient and performative, but they still suffer from genetic diseases and\ndisorders leading to an impaired animal welfare. In pigs, genetic disorders such as scrotal hernia, cryptorchidism and porcine congenital\nsplay leg syndrome impose serious welfare issues, while Belgian Blue cattle are extremely sensitive to psoroptic mange. For each of\nthese conditions, prior research of our consortium has identified putative loci and candidate genes resulting from transcriptomic\nanalyses and genome-wide association studies. The proposed project aims to use cutting edge genomic sequencing techniques to\nidentify causal variants and underlying mechanisms based on this prior research. Total RNA transcriptomics will be combined with deep\nwhole genome sequencing and several validation steps. These identified causative mutations can be used in selection programs.\nHowever, the availability of more genetic tests and (genomic) information sources, confronts the breeders with a lack of tools to make\nan sustainable breeding decision combining all these results at once. Therefore, we will develop an innovative approach to properly\nweigh and utilize genetic test results, breeding values and genomic information in practical breeding strategies. Overall, this project aims\nto harmonize efficiency and welfare through a genetic and hence sustainable approach in our two major livestock breeds.\nS020024N\nPrincipal Investigator: Prof. Dr. Nadine Buys (KU Leuven)\nID: \nID: \n210214\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-10-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n30-09-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n07-01-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

All data generated in the project will be stored on KU Leuven internal servers (J: (Shared) , K: (Archive) and L: (Large Volume Storage) drives). Before digitalization, records of sampling will be stored in physical folders and scanned as PDF during digitalization. Biological samples (blood, ear notches) and extracted DNA/RNA will be stored in the freezers (-20°C / -80°C) of the CABG Bio Sample Database, if possible in different aliquots, stored over different freezers on different electric circuits. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS. Biological samples: if possible, all samples will be aliquoted (3 or 4 aliquots) and divided over different freezers, all with temperature alarm signals.
