Increasing thinning intensity has been proposed as a drought alleviation strategy. However, the possible drawback of thinning on\nthe forest microclimate is often overlooked, even though it is an ecosystem feature underlying forest biodiversity and many forest ecosystem\nprocesses. Therefore, this research aims at understanding the relationship between thinning intensity and the drought response of trees, while\nalso investigating the negative feedbacks of management on the microclimate. The study will be executed at two spatial scales, (i) a forest\nstand scale with in situ measurements of tree growth, forest microclimate (temperature and soil moisture) and woodlice populations and (ii) a\nregional scale through remote sensing analysis and forest inventory data. We will focus on the tree species oak and beech.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? No sensitive data will be produced during the project. All data saved to the KU Leuven OneDrive for Business is password protected through the central KU Leuven login. KU Leuven obliges users to update passwords regularly. The folders will be locked and only accessible by the authorised staff. Only people with allocated rights can access data, for example, during collaborations. 6. Data preservation after the FWO project Which data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...). 1 . All physical samples (tree cores, pitfall samples) will be stored for a non-specified amount of time. 2 . All final datasets used for analyses for publications and PhD dissertations will be retained. Datasets will have been converted to standard file formats. 3 . All codes and scripts will be stored. 4 . Even after the 5 year period, the data and scripts will remain available for lab members of the forest, nature and landscape group. Where will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)? After the project, long-term storage and storage of larger files is guaranteed through the Forest, Nature and Landscape Archive drive at KU Leuven, which has automatic back-up procedures. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered? This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 3 of 4 No extra cost are expected for long-term storage of the data. The data are estimated to be within the allowed limit of the FNL Archive server. 7. Data sharing and reuse Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Yes. Specify: The data regarding the Flemish forest inventory (Agentschap Natuur en Bos), the permanent forest reserve plots (Instituut voor Natuur- en Bosonderzoek) and the gridded observational database (Royal Meteorological Institute) are obtained through data contracts and agreements, which limit data use and (re)distribution. The obtained data can only be used for and during my PhD research and cannot be distributed to other parties. Which data will be made available after the end of the project? All relevant data on which publications were based will be made available publicly in a standardised format. Data obtained through agreements with third parties will not be published openly. For this data, I will refer to the third party. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? In an Open Access repository 1 . Relevant datasets will be uploaded in a standardised format in Zenodo. 2 . The source code will be made available on GitHub. When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results The datasets not falling under an agreement which are used in the publication will be shared. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? The relevant datasets, which are not part of an agreement, will be uploaded in a standardised format in Zenodo as an open access dataset under a CC-BY license. Therefore, it will be available to anyone for any purpose, provided that they give appropriate credit to the creators. Published data will be available for everybody with access to the publication as per publisher's rules. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered? There are no expected costs for data sharing. 8. Responsibilities Who will be responsible for data documentation & metadata? Sanne Verdonck (KU Leuven) Bart Muys (KU Leuven) Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project? Sanne Verdonck (KU Leuven) Bart Muys (KU Leuven) ICTS Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ? Sanne Verdonck (KU Leuven) Bart Muys (KU Leuven) ICTS Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP? The PI bears the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP.
