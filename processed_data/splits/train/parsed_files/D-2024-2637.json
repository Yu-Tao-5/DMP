Strikingly, \nthe exact role of CIN during tumor evolution is still unclear: is CIN an initiating factor, a facilitator or simply \na side effect of the tumorigenic process? Previo us studies have been inconclusive and suggested a tumor -\npromoting, neutral or even a tumor -suppressive role of CIN. In my project I aim to dissect the effect of CIN \nduring different stages of mammary tumor progression, starting from healthy tissue until th e metastatic \ndissemination phase. I will employ a novel conditional CIN mouse model (CiMKi), that enables control over \nthe intensity, timing and tissue -specificity of CIN. This will uniquely allow me to determine for which \nphases and at what severities CIN  promotes tumor evolution, and in which conditions CIN has a less \nrelevant or even negative effect. I will use CiMKi mice in combination with lineage tracing and longitudinal \nintravital microscopy to identify in real -time the effect of different degrees of  CIN on tumor cell behaviour, \nproliferation, and progression. Image -guided micro -dissection of CIN tumor clones and their micro -\nenvironment followed by single -cell RNA sequencing will elucidate the impact of CIN on tumor cell fate. \nMoreover, it will enable  deep phenotyping of the niches in which CIN cells reside. Ultimately, this \nspatiotemporal characterization of CIN will elucidate the role of different degrees of CIN during tumor \ninitiation and progression.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        4 \n 2.

Moreover, it will enable deep phenotyping of the niches in which CIN cells reside. Ultimately, this spatiotemporal characterization of CIN will elucidate the role of different degrees of CIN during tumor initiation and progression.
