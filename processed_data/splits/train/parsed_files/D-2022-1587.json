Various methods have been developed in all\nstages of the process including differential extraction to separate epithelial from sperm\ncells and the deconvolution of the mixtures using probabilistic genotyping. Despite all\nefforts, partial profiles and complex mixtures still all too often compromise the\nresolution of cases leaving victims out in the cold. Recent technological\nadvancements such as micromanipulation and strategies such as the\nbinomial/multinomial sampling approach have shown promise towards solving the\nobstacle of DNA mixture interpretation. The proposed study has 3 main aims: (i)\nimprove success rates of existing single cell methods for forensic applications through\nnucleated cell selection (ii) carry out a feasibility study for the practical application in\nroutine workflows and (iii) perform a proof of concept study through the analysis of\nmock casework samples.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
