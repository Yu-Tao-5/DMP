However, most health researchers have\nexamined these issues from a clinical perspective and not much is known about the underlying\nsocial psychological mechanisms that may account for such outcomes. This project aims to build\na bridge between social psychology and health research by examining social identity processes\nleading to lower health and wellbeing outcomes for men. With both correlational and\nexperimental studies, we look at the strength of menâ€™s gender identification and of the belief\nthat their masculinity is easily lost and needs repeated social proof. We propose that a strong\nidentification as a man and such beliefs interact, leading to unfavorable outcomes in 3 domains:\na) more unhealthy behavior, b) generally lower health benefits of friendships, and c) generally\nless communal self-views compared to women. We investigate the role of masculinity threat in\nthis process and use cardiovascular measures of challenge and threat to assess the underlying\nrole of threat more directly and continuously. The project will contribute by increasing our\nunderstanding of why menâ€™s wellbeing and health may be impeded in these domains and\nprovide leverage for interventions to reverse such effects.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nYes\n For dataset 3a and 3b, there is a data use agreement set up by the UCOM core team\n(https://ucom2017.wordpress.com/). Restrictions: 1) The applicant cannot publish from these\ndata on their own and may only pursue a specific project idea in collaboration (co-authorship)\nwith at least one core team supervisor, 2) the applicant cannot share the data with other\nresearchers. \nFor all empirical datasets, students (thesis students/research interns/job students) will sign a\nconfidentiality agreement to not distribute this information, to delete this data once they stop\nworking on the data, and to treat this information with respect and in a confidential way.\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nFor each dataset generated by the applicant, a data sheet will be made, according to the data\nmanagement protocol of the research unit of CSCP of the faculty of Psychology and Educational\nSciences, which deals with (1) the essential project information and (2) the study content\ninformation. In (1) the project title will be added, as well as the main contributors, the start and\nend date of the project, the funding for the project, the start and end date of the data collection,\nthe reference to the approval of the ethical commission and the location of all the information\nabout the project that is stored on personal computers. In (2) the aims and research questions\nare discussed, as well as the design, the final sample and sampling procedure, the data collection\nequipment, the software used for data collection and data analyses (including SPSS syntax and R\ncode files), the materials that are used, variable-level information (label, question text, codes,\nfrequencies), a summary of the analyses and results, references to publications or other official\noutput, and certain problems during data collection or analyses or if certain participants were\nremoved and why. For the speech tasks of 2c and 2f, details on the setting, the subjects and the\ninstructions given to participants will also be documented in a Word document, as well as steps\ntaken to remove direct identifiers (pseudonymisation) in the data will be described. For 4a,\narticles will be stored in subfolders according to topic in Mendeley and Mendeley tags will be\nadded for further categorization. A read-me file will also be added in the folder of each dataset,\nwith information about the contents of the subfolders of the studies.\nFor 3a and b, the necessary documentation for the datasets is already created by the UCOM\nteam (uploaded to OSF and Dropbox) and directly accessible to both the applicant and the main\nsupervisor (Colette Van Laar). After the analyses are complete, the applicant will upload all\nannotated R code files, possible subdatasets, a summary of the analyses and results, and\nreferences to publications or other official output to Dropbox. The UCOM team also uses Google\nspreadsheet to document subproject information, variable information, and data/analyses\nissues. \nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nDescriptive metadata will be created as part of the documentation on study content information,\ncf. answer above. In addition, the SPSS datafiles automatically capture various metadata: e.g.,\ncreator of data, date that the data was created, data size, location, language, descriptive\nvariable and value labels, missing values and measurement levels.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 7\n1, 2, 4: During the process of conducting the study, the applicant will store all the data on\nBitlocker encrypted computers on OneDrive operated by KU Leuven. Email addresses and\npersonal data needed for paying participants will be kept separately from survey responses and\nexperimental data. Only the applicant, main supervisor, co-supervisor, and possibly students\nworking on the project will have access to the raw data. For 2c and 2f: after the pseudonymized\ntranscripts have been made, the raw voice/webcam recordings will be deleted. After a study is\ncompleted, the applicant will also upload the data (except the personally identifying data, but\nincluding the transcribed and pseudonymized speech tasks) to a shared network drive of the\nresearch unit CSCP at the faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences. The applicant will\nfollow the data management protocol of this research unit. For each of the four studies a folder is\nmade with the same subfolders: (1) a read-me file; (2) a data sheet; (3) the conceptualization of\nthe study: literature review, meetings, preparatory studies; (4) the organisation of the study:\nethical approval, participant recruitment; (5) the material of the study: e.g. used questionnaire,\ninterview, scales, including a subfolder with the development of the material (different steps,\nfeedback, pilot study, ...); (6) the data and analysis of the study: raw data (see below),\nanonymised data, data cleaning (with amongst others the syntax and cleaned dataset) and the\nresults; (7) output: manuscripts, presentations.\n3: Since we collaborate with researchers from other universities (UCOM), we use Dropbox for\nactive use of the data during the project. Additional documentation is stored in Google\nspreadsheets (cf. section 4).\nHow is backup of the data provided?\n For 1, 2, and 4: All data is stored on OneDrive operated by KU Leuven, and after a study is\ncompleted also on a shared network drive of the research unit CSCP at the faculty of Psychology\nand Educational Sciences (except the personally identifying data, but including the transcribed\nand pseudonymized speech tasks)\nFor 3, the UCOM team uses Dropbox for making backups. \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nEach KU Leuven OneDrive account has 2TB storage. The applicant's Dropbox account has 2TB\nstorage.\n \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nFor the applicant's Dropbox subscription, € 119,88/year is paid from their FWO bench fee.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nFor all datasets containing personal data (e.g., gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation etc.) and the\ntranscribed and pseudonymised speech tasks of 2c and 2f, data will be stored on Bitlocker\nencrypted computers on OneDrive operated by KU Leuven. When a study has been completed,\nthe applicant will also upload all the data (expect the personally identifying data) to a network\ndrive of the research unit CSCP at the faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences. The data\ncan also be made available to students for certain purposes, such as a student job, a bachelor's\nthesis or master's thesis.\nFor 2c and 2f, the raw recordings will only be stored on Bitlocker encrypted computers on\nOneDrive linked to a KU Leuven account for the duration of the transcribing and\npseudonymization (after which they will be deleted). Only the applicant, main supervisor, co-\nsupervisor, and possibly students working on the project will have access to the raw data.\n \n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n5 of 7\nAll data will be retained at least for the expected 5 years period after the end of the project,\nexcept the raw voice/webcam recordings of 2c and 2f, which will be deleted after the\npseudonymized transcripts have been made, and the personal information needed for\npayment/sending results/sending invitations for follow-up studies/coupon lottery, which will be\ndeleted after they are used for their purpose. \nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers (i.e., the J-drive of CSCP, with\nautomatic back-up procedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\n/\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nYes. Specify:\nFor 3a and 3b, a data use agreement has been set up by the core members of the UCOM team\nfor all people accessing the data. This document states that the data collected for the UCOM\nproject will become unrestrictedly available from November 1 2027. Before that date, the\napplicant must act in line with the Belgian data protection law to restrict data access. \nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nAll data except the raw and pseudonymised transcripts of 2c, 2f, and datasets 3a and b will be\navailable for researchers outside of the research unit upon request to the main supervisor, for\nresearch purposes, meta-analytical reviews, ethical questions or journals' publishing\nrequirements. \nTo protect the identity of the participants, the pseudonymised transcripts of 2c and 2f will only be\navailable upon request to the main supervisor within the research unit.

For 2c and 2f: after the pseudonymized transcripts have been made, the raw voice/webcam recordings will be deleted. After a study is completed, the applicant will also upload the data (except the personally identifying data, but including the transcribed and pseudonymized speech tasks) to a shared network drive of the research unit CSCP at the faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences. The applicant will follow the data management protocol of this research unit. For each of the four studies a folder is made with the same subfolders: (1) a read-me file; (2) a data sheet; (3) the conceptualization of the study: literature review, meetings, preparatory studies; (4) the organisation of the study: ethical approval, participant recruitment; (5) the material of the study: e.g. used questionnaire, interview, scales, including a subfolder with the development of the material (different steps, feedback, pilot study, ...); (6) the data and analysis of the study: raw data (see below), anonymised data, data cleaning (with amongst others the syntax and cleaned dataset) and the results; (7) output: manuscripts, presentations. 3: Since we collaborate with researchers from other universities (UCOM), we use Dropbox for active use of the data during the project. Additional documentation is stored in Google spreadsheets (cf. section 4). How is backup of the data provided? For 1, 2, and 4: All data is stored on OneDrive operated by KU Leuven, and after a study is completed also on a shared network drive of the research unit CSCP at the faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences (except the personally identifying data, but including the transcribed and pseudonymized speech tasks) For 3, the UCOM team uses Dropbox for making backups. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Each KU Leuven OneDrive account has 2TB storage. The applicant's Dropbox account has 2TB storage. What are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these costs be covered? For the applicant's Dropbox subscription, € 119,88/year is paid from their FWO bench fee. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? For all datasets containing personal data (e.g., gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation etc.) and the transcribed and pseudonymised speech tasks of 2c and 2f, data will be stored on Bitlocker encrypted computers on OneDrive operated by KU Leuven. When a study has been completed, the applicant will also upload all the data (expect the personally identifying data) to a network drive of the research unit CSCP at the faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences. The data can also be made available to students for certain purposes, such as a student job, a bachelor's thesis or master's thesis. For 2c and 2f, the raw recordings will only be stored on Bitlocker encrypted computers on OneDrive linked to a KU Leuven account for the duration of the transcribing and pseudonymization (after which they will be deleted). Only the applicant, main supervisor, co- supervisor, and possibly students working on the project will have access to the raw data. 6. Data preservation after the FWO project Which data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...). This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 5 of 7 All data will be retained at least for the expected 5 years period after the end of the project, except the raw voice/webcam recordings of 2c and 2f, which will be deleted after the pseudonymized transcripts have been made, and the personal information needed for payment/sending results/sending invitations for follow-up studies/coupon lottery, which will be deleted after they are used for their purpose. Where will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)? The data will be stored on the university's central servers (i.e., the J-drive of CSCP, with automatic back-up procedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered? / 7. Data sharing and reuse Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Yes. Specify: For 3a and 3b, a data use agreement has been set up by the core members of the UCOM team for all people accessing the data. This document states that the data collected for the UCOM project will become unrestrictedly available from November 1 2027. Before that date, the applicant must act in line with the Belgian data protection law to restrict data access. Which data will be made available after the end of the project? All data except the raw and pseudonymised transcripts of 2c, 2f, and datasets 3a and b will be available for researchers outside of the research unit upon request to the main supervisor, for research purposes, meta-analytical reviews, ethical questions or journals' publishing requirements. To protect the identity of the participants, the pseudonymised transcripts of 2c and 2f will only be available upon request to the main supervisor within the research unit. The raw webcam/microphone speeches will not be made available. The data collected for the UCOM project (3a,b) will become unrestrictedly available from November 1 2027, as determined by the UCOM data use agreement. The research articles for 4a are already publicly available and will be easy to find in the reference list of the review article. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? In a restricted access repository KU Leuven Research Data Repository (RDR), https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? All data except the raw and pseudonymised transcripts of 2c,2f and 3a,3b will be available outside of the research unit upon request to the main supervisor, for research purposes, meta- analytical reviews, ethical questions or journals' publishing requirements. To protect the identity of the participants, the pseudonymised transcripts of 2c,2f will only be available upon request to the main supervisor within the research unit. The raw webcam/microphone speeches will not be made available. The data collected for the UCOM project (3a,b) will become unrestrictedly available from November 1 2027, as determined by the UCOM data use agreement. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered? / 8. Responsibilities Who will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?
