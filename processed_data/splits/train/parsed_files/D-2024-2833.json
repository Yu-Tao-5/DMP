The corresponding rate\ncoefficients are often calculated using theories based on capture models, but these are known to be inadequate in many instances. In addition, they do\nnot allow the calculation of state-to-state rate coefficients (that are resolved in the ro-vibrational states of the reactants and the products), which is\ncrucial to model environments that are not at local thermodynamic equilibrium, such as those that commonly arise in astrophysical media. In this\nproject we will develop a general approach that relies on machine learning tools to construct multidimensional potential energy surfaces combined with\nquasi-classical trajectory calculations to study the reaction dynamics. A major aspect of this project will be the collaboration with experimentalists at\nthe University of Liverpool, who have recently started investigating ion-molecule reactions below room temperature, which led to some unexpected\nfindings.\nThis project will lead to new insights into the underlying mechanisms of ion-molecule reactions at low temperature, with direct applications to\nastrochemistry and to the interpretation of state-of-the-art experiments.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n03-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
