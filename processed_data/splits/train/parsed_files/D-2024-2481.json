Media literacy is typically developed through\nformal interventions in which educators instruct adolescents on how to understand and evaluate media messages. However, the few existing social\nmedia literacy intervention studies have come to inconsistent results in terms of effectively increasing skills and reducing negative social media effects.\nThat is likely because these interventions all adopt a generic approach, even though adolescents differ in how they experience social media and have\nthus different social media literacy needs. For that reason, the current project will test a science-based social media literacy intervention program, and\nthereby introduces a new theoretical framework on the formal development of social\nmedia literacy through customized interventions. The empirical value of the framework will be determined by examining the effectiveness of the\nintervention program in reducing harmful and strengthening beneficial positivity bias effects by use of a cluster randomized control intervention study\nin combination with ESM data. From a societal viewpoint, this project answers the longstanding calls from parents, educators and policy makers to\nprovide evidence-based actions to make children\nflourish in a media-saturated world.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n28-03-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
