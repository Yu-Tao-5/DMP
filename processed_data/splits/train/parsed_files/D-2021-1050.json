It aims, for the first time,\nto present Husserlâ€™s account on induction and probability, which has remained neglected in\nHusserlian scholarship and unexplored in the phenomenological tradition. By tracing an\nuncharted path that culminates in Husserlâ€™s reflections on induction and probability, and that\ndiffers significantly from the prevailing 20th century treatments of induction, the project also\ndevelops a new theoretical approach that distinguishes and examines a range of philosophical\nissues connected with induction. In this way, the project fills a gap in the existing literature and\noffers a new attempt at addressing the â€˜problem of inductionâ€™ by re-conceiving it as a\ncluster of interrelated, and yet diversified, questions.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
