One of these is the formation and\nexpansion of large urban gullies (UGs) in many (sub)tropical cities. UGs typically lead to the destruction of houses and other infrastructures, displace\nlarge numbers of people and often claim casualties. As such, UGs form a new type of geo-hydrological hazard in the Anthropocene. Yet, this issue\nremains largely under-researched. So far we observed UGs in more than 100 cities in Africa, but the actual scale and impacts of UGs across the\ncontinent are currently unknown. Moreover, further urbanization and climate change will likely aggravate the problem. This project will help tackle\nthese emerging research needs by: (i) better documenting UGs and their impacts across Africa; (ii) constructing a model that can simulate the initiation\nand expansion of UGs in relation to its key driving factors; (iii) applying this model at the scale of Africa to identify current hotspots of UGs and to\nquantify some of the key impacts (e.g. number of persons directly displaced by UGs); and (iv) conducting scenario analyses with our model to assess\nhow the potential impacts of UGs will evolve as a result of continued urbanization and climate change.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n09-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

We expect, however, that the metadata will closely follow field-specific standards such as the Federal Geographic Data Committee’s Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata, NASA’s Earth Science Data Systems’ ASCII File Format Guidelines for Earth Science Data, or the International Organization for Standardization’s (ISO) 19115-1:2014 Geographic Information – Metadata – Part 1: Fundamentals. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? The data will be stored on multiple storage platforms, including OneDrive with a 2TB capacity, SharePoint with a 5TB capacity, and external hard drives situated at various locations, including the home of the PhD candidate and the office of the promoter.

Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Yes, there is currently sufficient storage and backup capacity (2TB capacity on OneDrive + 5TB capacity on SharePoint + 5TB capacity on hard drive) during the project to store the expected amount of data needed (~ 3TB). How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Access to both the original data and its backups will be tightly controlled, restricted to the principal investigator (the PhD candidate) and the promoter. In cases where selected portions of the data must be shared, such as with Bachelor’s and Master’s students, a separate version of the data will be created. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project is ∼ 300 euros (price of external hard drives). These costs will be covered by the PhD candidate’s FWO bench fee. 4.
