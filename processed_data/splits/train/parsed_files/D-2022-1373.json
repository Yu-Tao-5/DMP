Yet, current practice only considers a limited selection of\ncardiopulmonary exercise indexes in isolation. To utilize the full value of clinical exercise testing\ndata, we will apply advanced machine learning (ML) approaches on big data that has been\ncollected/will be collected in patients at UZ Leuven (n=1800) and within the general population\n(FLEMENGHO cohort; n=650). We will develop integrative models that characterize personalized\ncardiorespiratory fitness profiling and its relation to subclinical stages of heart failure. In addition,\nwe will combine innovative immunometabolic profiling measured by an advanced -omics\ntechnique with integrative ML approaches to elucidate key pathways of inflammatory and\nmetabolic stress associated with the cardiopulmonary response to exercise and subclinical heart\ndysfunction. This pioneering project will lead to novel cardiopulmonary exercise-based\nalgorithms that enable more precise evaluation of cardiac health and boost the development of\npersonalized exercise programs. As such, these innovative models will enhance the early\ndetection and management of heart diseases in order to counter its epidemic burden on the\ncommunity. Objectives of the research (project): In this project we will apply integrative\ncomputer modeling to clinical exercise data and to detailed molecular profiles: \n1) to develop\nnovel cardiopulmonary exercise-based ML models that enable personalized cardiorespiratory\nfitness profiling and its relation to subclinical stages of HF; 2) to construct integrative risk\nclassifiers predicting the effect of a 4-month exercise program on physical fitness and cardiac\nfunction; \n3) to elucidate key immune-metabolic pathways associated with cardiorespiratory\nfitness and subclinical HF profiling and the cardiopulmonary response to exercise therapy.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Véronique Cornelissen, co-PI in the current project). \nDo you use personal data (i.e. all data possibly identifying an individual)?\nYes\nThe PRET reference: \nG-2021-3704\n1. Retrospective data\n: A unique identifier was previously assigned to each patient (without\nreference to gender, date of birth or other data). The head of the Cardiac Rehabilitation\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 4\nDepartment of UZ Leuven (Dr. Kaatje Goestschalckx) has the encryption codes of the\nidentification codes.

The deidentification key of\nthe prospective data will be managed by Prof. Tatiana Kouznetsova. In summary, there will be\ntwo datasets with pseudonymised data (1 prospective, 1 retrospective), which will be merged\ninto a Redcap database.\n2. Retrospective and prospective databases include the following \nhealth information\n: (i) personal\nand anthropometric data (date of birth, gender, height, weight, waist-to-hip circumference;\nskinfolds, etc.); (ii) coded information on medical history and lifestyle; (iii) blood pressure; (iv)\ncomputerised ECGs; (vi) echocardiographic measurements; (vii) cardiopulmonary testing data;\n(viii) biochemical measurements including -omics data; (ix) information on the incidence of fatal\nand non-fatal events. \n3. The electronic data will be store on secure network drive from KU Leuven (e.g. I / J\ndrive); OneDrive linked to a KU Leuven account, and REDCap. The paper forms (CRFs) will be\nstored in the principal investigator's office at KU Leuven in a locked cabinet accessible only to the\nresearcher.\n4.
