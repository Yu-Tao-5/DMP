Therefore, \nenabling formulation strategies to address this problem have become vital in pharmaceutical industry. Among these \nstrategies, molecularly dispersing a poorly soluble drug in an amorphous polymer matrix to form amorphous solid \ndispersions (ASDs) is promising. Previously, ASDs have mostly consisted of a poorly soluble drug incorporated in a \nwater-soluble polymer carrier. However, through the work at the Drug Delivery and Disposition Lab (KULeuven), it \nhas been discovered that the rate at which supersaturation is installed depends on the release rate. By slow release \nof the drug, supersaturation can be prolonged, which leads to a better absorption profile. Still, it is not known yet \nwhich polymer-based slow release ASD system is optimal to delay precipitation and thus, prolong supersaturation of \nthe drug (main research question). Therefore we want to further broaden the knowledge of the relation between the \nformulation, the hydrophobicity, the microstructure and drug release kinetics of slow release ASD formulations by \ninvestigating three different slow release ASD concepts with varying levels of hydrophobicity. An in depth \ninvestigation of the microstructure, drug release and stability of these concepts will enable us to answer our main \nresearch question.\nLast modified: 18-11-2024\nSLOW RELEASE AMORPHOUS SOLID DISPERSIONS TO PROLONG \nSUPERSATURATION IN THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT.  \nDPIA\nDPIA\nHave you performed a DPIA for the personal data processing activities for this project?\n●Not applicable\nSLOW RELEASE AMORPHOUS SOLID DISPERSIONS TO PROLONG \nSUPERSATURATION IN THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT.  \nGDPR\nGDPR\nHave you registered personal data processing activities for this project?\n●No\nSLOW RELEASE AMORPHOUS SOLID DISPERSIONS TO PROLONG \nSUPERSATURATION IN THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT.  \nApplication DMP\nQUESTIONNAIRE\nDescribe the datatypes (surveys, sequences, manuscripts, objects … ) the research will collect and/or \ngenerate and /or (re)use.
