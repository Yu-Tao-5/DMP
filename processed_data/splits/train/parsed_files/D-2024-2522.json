Despite their centrality\nto our life, it remains unclear how we ought to understand deep disagreements and their implications for moral progress. My research aims to fill this\nlacuna by rethinking the study of deep disagreements with Wittgenstein. First, drawing on Wittgenstein’s views and philosophical method, I develop a\nnovel account of deep disagreements. Against existing theories of deep disagreements, I defend that it is a mistake to assume that the characteristics of\ndeep disagreements display a theoretical unity that can only be adequately explained by one true global theory. Instead, deep disagreements are\ncomplex phenomena that are to be clarified by a variety of complementary local explanations. Second, I use this account of deep disagreements to\nassess whether they can contribute to moral progress. Specifically, I study the challenges of, and the unique opportunities offered by, deep\ndisagreements to determine if there are any strategies for constructive dialogue that contribute to moral progress.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n17-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
