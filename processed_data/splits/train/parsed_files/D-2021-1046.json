AT NERF, we have a data storage system with 327 TB capacity. The system has multiple layers of \nprotection to ensure long-term data retention. First, the system is distributed into two datacenter sites which \nact as a mirror. Second, snapshots of the data are taken regularly that allow recovering from accidental \ncorruption or deletion of data. Third, the system screens the data on a regular basis to avoid data corruption \ndue to bit-rot. Lastly, the disks in each server are configured using RAIDZ2 (a type of ZFS). \nNERF storage system for actual data, it is composed of two subsystems, one is a dedicated archive system \nand the another one is for Work In Progress (WIP). The former is an object storage system, for which \nNERF has an active maintenance contract with the provider (Cloudian), while the latter is a filesystem \nbased on openZFS. \nThe archive system serves to store data that needs to be kept long term (years) due to legal requirements or \nfor a later analysis. This system is so-called “nerfhf01 ”. \nThe WIP system offers a high throughput which suits best for highly demanding daily IO operations. This \nsystem is so-called “nerffs13 ” \nHow will the data be backed up? The storage system at NERF has multiple layers of protection to ensure long-term data retention.\nThe WIP server (nerffs13) has a \"twin\" server located in a different data center which acts as a mirror of the\nformer. This provides data backup in case of full failure of the nerffs13, whether caused for severe hardware\nissues or in case the entire data center is compromised. Furthermore, snapshots of the data are taken \nregularly that allow recovering from accidental corruption or deletion of data, which in combination with a \nRAIDZ2 (zfs-raid) configuration provides a strong data redundancy per server. Lastly, the system screens \nthe data on a regular basis to avoid data corruption due to bit-rot.\nThe archive system (nerfhf01) is a redundant system on itself, this is composed of several nodes distributed \nin multiple data centers. The nerfhf01 technology allows to have one entire node down and data is not \ncompromised.\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 11Is there currently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of. Yes\nSTORAGE: the archive and WIP systems have roughly 500TB of capacity each, until 2021. These can be \nexpanded upon necessity and considering technical specs. This task is managed by the admin of the system, \nwho also performs the upgrades and provides data storage monitoring and reporting \nBACKUP: the archive system, up-to-date, comprises 13 nodes (servers) distributed across three server \nrooms located in different buildings. This yields a full data redundancy for long term storage data, which is \nprotected even if more than one entire node fails. \nIn the case of the WIP system, this is composed of 2 servers placed in different buildings. One of the servers\nis the one that users connect to, while the another one has a copy of all the data which is nightly updated, \nyielding a strong data redundancy. Moreover, each of these servers are in in a RAID-Z2 configuration, \nmeaning that if until two disks fail at the same time, data integrity is preserved. \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the project? How will these \ncosts be covered? \nAlthough FWO has no earmarked budget at its \ndisposal to support correct research data \nmanagement, FWO allows for part of the allocated \nproject budget  to be used to cover the cost incurred.Based on the last two years expenses and data storage forecast, NERF costs for the storage system \ncomprises the hardware itself, and license and maintenance costs. The former amounts to 45000 € per \nyear and the latter to 15000 € per year. These costs are covered by the NERF central budget.\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 12Data security: how will you ensure that the data \nare securely stored and not accessed or \nmodified by unauthorized persons? NERF servers are in imec campus at Leuven. Thus, we have strong network protection as provided by imec \nfirewalls. Moreover, imec provides a dedicated VLAN for NERF, meaning that only registered devices can \naccess to the NERF network from the imec campus. \nFor users outside of the imec campus, a Cisco AnyConnect VPN can be used to access to the NERF \nnetwork. The VPN login authorization is setup by two factors authentification for each user. This VPN is \nprovided and maintained by imec. \nIn addition to that network security, the access to our storage servers from user computers is via SMB \nprotocol. Therefore, each research group at NERF has their own “SMB accounts ” as setup in the storage \nserver by the system admin. \nConsequently, whether a device in-imec-campust or out-imec-campus attempts to access to the NERF \nnetwork and thereafter to NERF storage servers, security layers on the network side and server accounts \nhave to be passed first. This strongly reduces the likelihood that unauthorized persons access to NERF data. \n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 136.Data preservation  after the end of the FWO project\nFWO expects that data generated during the project are retained for a period of minimally 5 years after the end of the project, in as far as legal and\ncontractual agreements allow.\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 \nyear period after the end of the project? In case \nonly a selection of the data can/will be \npreserved, clearly state the reasons  for this \n(legal or contractual restrictions, physical \npreservation issues, ...).The minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets. All \ndatasets will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic back-up procedures for at least 5 \nyears, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.\nIf applicable:\nDatasets collected in the context of clinical research, which fall under the scope of the Belgian Law of 7 \nMay 2004, will be archived for 25 years, in agreement with UZ Leuven policy and the European Regulation\n536/2014 on clinical trials of medicinal products for human use.\nWhere will these data be archived (= stored for \nthe long term)? Data that needs long term storage is stored in nerfhf01.\nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during these 5 years? How will the \ncosts be covered?\nAlthough FWO has no earmarked budget at its \ndisposal to support correct research data \nmanagement, FWO allows for part of the allocated \nproject budget  to be used to cover the cost incurred.That amounts roughly to 60000 € per year, and will be covered by the NERF central budget.\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 147.Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing \nthe sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as \ndefined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal \nrestrictions)? No\nWhich data will be made available after the end \nof the project? Participants to the present project are committed to publish research results to communicate them to peers \nand to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made openly accessible. \nDepending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to publication, either on an individual \nbasis to interested researchers and/or potential new collaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. negative \ndata).\nWe aim at communicating our results in top journals that require full disclosure upon publication of all \nincluded data, either in the main text, in supplementary material or in a data repository if requested by the \njournal and following deposit advice given by the journal. Depending on the journal, accessibility \nrestrictions may apply.\nBiological material will be distributed to other parties if requested\nWhere/how will the data be made available for \nreuse? In an Open Access repository, Upon request by mail\nWhen will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 15Who will be able to access the data and under \nwhat conditions?  Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through \nrepositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain sufficient information \nto support data interpretation and reuse, and will be conform to community norms. These repositories \nclearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) \nPublic Domain Dedication, a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) or an ODC Public Domain \nDedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby\nbe allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the \ncorresponding DOI. For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure \nagreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of \nreuse that are permitted.\nFor the Raes lab:\nData will be accessible to academic researchers via the European Genome-Phenome Archive. For industry, \ndata access will be subject to specific contracts.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? \nHow will these costs be covered? \nAlthough FWO has no earmarked budget at its \ndisposal to support correct research data \nmanagement, FWO allows for part of the allocated \nproject budget  to be used to cover the cost incurred.It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for \nmetadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-\nuse data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be \ncovered by the laboratory budget. A budget for publication costs has been requested in this project.\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 168.Responsibilities\nWho will be responsible for the data \ndocumentation & metadata? Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, \nby taking careful notes in dedicated files (like Excel).\nIn addition, as indicated in the section 11, jobs launched in the nerfcluster will automatically create \nmetadata, where the responsable is the system administrator of NERF.\nWho will be responsible for data storage & back \nup during the project? As long as the data is in the central storage system of NERF, the responsable is the system administrator of\nNERF.\nWho will be responsible for ensuring data \npreservation and sharing? The researchers involved and the PI.\nWho bears the end responsibility for updating &\nimplementing this DMP? \nDefault response : The PI bears the overall \nresponsibility for updating & implementing this DMPThe PI is ultimately responsable for all data management during and after data collection, including \nimplementation ad updating DMP."

These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication, a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) or an ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted. For the Raes lab: Data will be accessible to academic researchers via the European Genome-Phenome Archive. For industry, data access will be subject to specific contracts. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Although FWO has no earmarked budget at its disposal to support correct research data management, FWO allows for part of the allocated project budget to be used to cover the cost incurred.It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to- use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. A budget for publication costs has been requested in this project. 2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 168.Responsibilities Who will be responsible for the data documentation & metadata? Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in dedicated files (like Excel). In addition, as indicated in the section 11, jobs launched in the nerfcluster will automatically create metadata, where the responsable is the system administrator of NERF. Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project? As long as the data is in the central storage system of NERF, the responsable is the system administrator of NERF. Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and sharing? The researchers involved and the PI. Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP? Default response : The PI bears the overall responsibility for updating & implementing this DMPThe PI is ultimately responsable for all data management during and after data collection, including implementation ad updating DMP."
