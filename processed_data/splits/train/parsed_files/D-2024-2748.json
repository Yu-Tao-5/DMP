For time lapse experiments further information about temperature of\nincubation and specific information of each respective recorded position are\ngathered, if applicable. Generic metadata about i.e., dimensions, image type, bitdepth,\npixel sizes and microscope settings are also included. Experimental\nspecifications i.e., about sample preparations are reported in handwritten notes\nin lab journals. Digitalized protocols for individual experimental archetypes are\npresent or will be created for potential later reproduction of results by other\nindividuals.\n2\n. \nGenetic data is either generated or imported into the \"Benchling\" portal, a cloud based online platform and respective metadata is added\nto the files. Access to data is shared inside the lab, making data internally accessible even after a person has left the lab. Additionally, for\nall primer sequences and all constructed bacterial strains, a comprehensive list will be provided featuring all the necessary information for\nfurther use (annealing temperatures, explanation of the primer's purpose and the primary template for the primer's table; For the strain's\ntable: Species, full\ngenotype, present plasmid(s), growing conditions, comprehensive notes on the construction of the strain, date of construction and location\nin the -80°C freezer). Sequence data itself is always coupled to a genetic sequence in 'Benchling'. The folder containing the raw sequence\ndata will be dated and given the same name as its cognate genetic sequence.\n3\n. \nExperimental results and other work documents are readily summarized and/or stored on our institute-based cloud \"Onedrive for\nbusiness\", together with text files describing the respective experimental setup and conditions.\nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data?

As mentioned before all other generic metadata has a standard format in the NIS-elements software and is\nprovided for every microscopic picture taken.\nGenetic data is not described using a general metadata format. A description of any genetic sequence/construct is provided and\nannotations of certain parts of the sequence are given. The list of primers, used to create these genetic sequences, and the strainslist\nsummarising strains equipped with these genetic constructs provide additional information. A personal semi-metadata system is used to\ndescribe day-to-day research activities in the lab journal or in digital summarized experimental results/ work documents: The same\ntype of information is always provided when performing a certain experiment.\nAn example: For any PCR that is run, the following information is provided: Type of PCR and additional information if needed for a\nspecific PCR type, Purpose of PCR, Polymerase used, primers used, annealing temperature, template used and length of\nproduced DNA with elongation time of the PCR.

Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). 1 . All microscopy experiments have metadata included into the resulting image file with manually written information about the type of experiment, strains, conditions. For time lapse experiments further information about temperature of incubation and specific information of each respective recorded position are gathered, if applicable. Generic metadata about i.e., dimensions, image type, bitdepth, pixel sizes and microscope settings are also included. Experimental specifications i.e., about sample preparations are reported in handwritten notes in lab journals. Digitalized protocols for individual experimental archetypes are present or will be created for potential later reproduction of results by other individuals. 2 . Genetic data is either generated or imported into the \"Benchling\" portal, a cloud based online platform and respective metadata is added to the files. Access to data is shared inside the lab, making data internally accessible even after a person has left the lab. Additionally, for all primer sequences and all constructed bacterial strains, a comprehensive list will be provided featuring all the necessary information for further use (annealing temperatures, explanation of the primer's purpose and the primary template for the primer's table; For the strain's table: Species, full genotype, present plasmid(s), growing conditions, comprehensive notes on the construction of the strain, date of construction and location in the -80°C freezer). Sequence data itself is always coupled to a genetic sequence in 'Benchling'. The folder containing the raw sequence data will be dated and given the same name as its cognate genetic sequence. 3 . Experimental results and other work documents are readily summarized and/or stored on our institute-based cloud \"Onedrive for business\", together with text files describing the respective experimental setup and conditions. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data?

Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 13 March 2024 7 of 11 Yes For microscopy data, a metadata model format with fill in fields has been created, so that the blanks can easily be filled in with the respective information. As mentioned before all other generic metadata has a standard format in the NIS-elements software and is provided for every microscopic picture taken. Genetic data is not described using a general metadata format. A description of any genetic sequence/construct is provided and annotations of certain parts of the sequence are given. The list of primers, used to create these genetic sequences, and the strainslist summarising strains equipped with these genetic constructs provide additional information. A personal semi-metadata system is used to describe day-to-day research activities in the lab journal or in digital summarized experimental results/ work documents: The same type of information is always provided when performing a certain experiment. An example: For any PCR that is run, the following information is provided: Type of PCR and additional information if needed for a specific PCR type, Purpose of PCR, Polymerase used, primers used, annealing temperature, template used and length of produced DNA with elongation time of the PCR. For instrumental readouts, standard metadata formats have already been established explaining the respective numerical outputs. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? All research data will be digitalized or is already digital by nature. 1. Copies of the data will be/are stored on a personal computer and automated cloud storage in parallel. 2. Microscopy data is saved on the micoscopy computer and imeadiately copied onto a PC and an external hard dive. 3. Genetic sequence data is stored in a could for easy shared access. 4. Lab journals are kept in the lab and are stored in an archive once a person has left the lab How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Data is backed up automatically via online cloud storage. At regular intervals backups of all data will be created on large external hard drives. This is especially the case for microscopy data too large for online clouds, these data will be thus stored in threefold to avoid loss of data due to data corruption (local computer, external computer, external hard drive). Once projects or chapters of larger projects are completed, i.e. publication of data, said data will be archived in an internal network. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Two personal 4TB hard drives from different suppliers and different types (SSD/HDD) are used to create regular two-fold backups of all research data, especially regular copes of microscopy data. Online institute-based storage space of 100GB for automated backups is sufficient and may be expanded if necessary. Lab Internal network storage can be expanded if needed but still has plenty of capacity. The Mango platform of KULeuven will be used for cloud storage of active microscopy data.
