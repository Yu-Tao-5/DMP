Hence it is ideally suited for heat extraction and thermal\ncooling applications, especially when complex optimized geometrical shapes with high surface to volume ratios can\nbe produced by for instance the use of Additive Manufacturing (AM). This ambitious research project aims at reducing\nthe mass and increasing the specific thermal performance of pure copper heat exchangers significantly. This will be\nachieved by researching novel gyroid lattice structure designs, beyond state-of-the-art laser based additive\nmanufacturing processes, unique post-processing strategies and in-depth understanding of the mechanical and\nthermal behaviour of the structures. The intended outcome is a validated proof-of-concept of a multi-functional\ncompact and lightweight copper heat exchanger, combining high specific structural and thermal performance in one\nintegrated component. This project will serve as a catalyst for the collaboration between KU Leuven and UC Louvain\non Additive Manufacturing while the resulting demonstrator will be used to attract industrial attentions and to define\nfollow-up projects at higher TRL with industrial stakeholders in Belgium and beyond.\nID: \nID: \n213273\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-09-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n31-08-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n04-03-2025\nGrant number / URL: \nGrant number / URL: \nC3/22/017\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
