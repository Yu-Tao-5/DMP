Current OA  \ntreatments are limited to pain relief, physiotherapy, or joint replacement surgery in severe cases, yet drugs  \nthat stop the disease progression are lacking. The Disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L) gene  \nencodes an enzyme that chemically modifies an amino-acid (Lysine at position 79) in the Histone-3 protein  \n(H3K79) by adding a methyl group. We identified DOT1L as key protector of cartilage homeostasis, using  \nhuman articular chondrocytes and Dot1l genetic mouse models. We reported that DOT1L activity, indicated  \nby the levels of H3K79 methylation (H3K79me), is reduced in OA as compared to non-OA cartilage.  \nTherefore, maintaining H3K79me seems to be critical to preserve joint health and prevent the development  \nor progression of OA. Here, we hypothesize that H3K79me could be increased by blocking the removal of  \nthe methyl group (demethylation) at the H3K79 site, via targeting a group of specific enzymes, the histone  \ndemethylases. In this new project, we aim to investigate which histone demethylases are specifically  \nresponsible for H3K79 demethylation and whether their inhibition leads to protective effects in OA using  \ndifferent OA models. This project could therefore identify interesting new targets for treatments in a disease  \nwith an enormous therapeutic need.\nInstitution: KU Leuven\n1.

DATA DESCRIPTION\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?  \n2●Generate new data\n●Reuse existing data\nDescribe the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume, ideally \nper objective or WP of the project. You might consider using the table in the guidance.\nData used in this project will mostly be new data. Existing data of interest are transcriptome datasets \nfrom the research team, available from the GEO repository (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/), under \naccession numbers GSE77916 and GSE33656. \nNew data are quantitative and qualitative experimental data including raw data, derived and \ncompiled data.  Overall, data will be from biological (molecular, biochemical) experiments and from \nanimal model experiments.  Qualitative raw data (photos, images) will be stored in investigator hard-copy \nnotebooks and in digital formats (TIFF, PDF). Original data files outputs from quantitative experiments will  \nbe collected in Excel datasheets. For data sharing across platforms, data will be additionally stored in csv \nand txt formats. Data anaysis files will be pfzx files (Prism), sav files (SPPS) and R-project files with \noutputs stored as txt and csv files. Animal experiment data are registered into KU Leuven's animal \nexperiment LAIS system and compiled in excel and text files. Data from animal experiments are both \nqualitative and quantitative as above (tissue sections, images) and processed data such as scoring of \ncartilage damage. Data will be stored in notebooks and in digital format as above.   Masterdata files will be  \nwrite-protected after entering all data.  \nData will be structured per experiment performed (Exp identifier) with structured subsets: 1. raw data (txt -  \ncsv) 2. analyses (txt - csv) 3. images (various formats) 4. \"readme\" txt information files. Additional \nstructured datasets will be stored per derived manuscript.  \nThe answers to this section were checked by:\n●Other\nco-principal investigator Prof. Rik Lories  \n3. LEGAL & ETHICAL ISSUES\nWill you use personal data?    If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use (add \nthe reference to your file in your host institution's privacy register - not relevant yet )  \n●No\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on \nhumans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant \nethical review committee(s)\n●Yes\nResearch in this project is covered by study  S56271 (Ethical Committee for Clinical Research UZ Leuven)  \nand by study P159/2016 (Ethical Committee for animal research).  \n3Does your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? \nWill IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions \nwill be asserted? \n●Yes\nData may be considered to claim intellectual property rights on the advice of Leuven R&D's valorisation \nteam. LRD will be responsible for patent management and eventual licensing. Data may be used for \nindustrial collaborations and will then be defined as KU Leuven background by LRD in good faith.  \nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If \nso, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\n●No\nNo, there are no restrictions on our data at this stage.  \nThe answers to this section were checked by:\nco-PI Rik Lories \n4. DOCUMENTATION & METADATA\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this \nproject?\nThe following documentation will be provided: (1) a table of content (excel file and csv) with all project-\nrelated experiments including experiment number, date of implementation and name of the researcher \nwho stored the experiment, (2) a brief description of the goal of the experiment and related work package \n(word and txt file), (3) a detailed protocol or link to an existing standard protocol (SOP) which will enable \nother researcher to repeat the experiment, (4) all data or link to another file with the (raw) data, (5) in case  \nof animal work: a list of the used animals with details such as age, sex, housing and link with LAIS system  \ninformation, (5) samples that are generated during the experiments will be stored and listed in a Csv file \nor txt file, (6) if appropriate, illustrations of the data with legends and statistical analysis. In case that \ndocumentation is written or available in notebooks  or stored on other files a link will be provided. (7) \nRead-me text files providing information about definitions used in the dataset files.  \nWith the help of these documentations every authorized researcher will be able (1) to look up all the \ninformation of the performed experiments and (2) to repeat the experiment in exactly the same way.  \nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used.  If no, \nstate in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse.\n●No\nOur anticipated data collection does not involve setups for which a metadata standard and specific \nrepository exists.
