Legal and ethical issues\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 5\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nYes\nThe types of participants that can be predicted at this stage include: i) ‘ordinary’ Cubans\nstanding in supermarket lines in 4different neighborhoods in Havana (Miramar, Vedado/Playa,\nCentro Habana and Regla); ii) ‘ordinary’ Cubans living in these four neighborhoods of three\ndifferent age categories:18-35; 35-55; 55-75 years; iii) Cuban activists (age 18-75) living in\nHavana. \nRegarding categories of personal data, for identification purposes (e.g. of interviews and field\nobservations) and because of its relevance to the study, age will be data to be collected, as well\nas gender and the place of residence (municipality and/or neighborhood, not specific address)\nsince (gendered) arguments about the spatial distribution of socioeconomic phenomenamay\narise in a study located in the field of urban geography. From interviews I am mostly interested\nin obtaining expert information and opinion on experiences of food access, i.e. food provisioning\nactivities that are undertaken by the participants. Only the interview process itself will reveal if\nthere is personal data (e.g. socioeconomic background or chronology of life events) that may be\nrelevant to address the project's objectives.\nOther than being legal adults (over 18) and the age categories, gender and residence area\nmentioned in the first subsectionabove, there is no exclusion criteria or control group.\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nYes\nNo\nYes, see PRET file: G-2022-4979\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nAfter each recorded interview, the researcher will emphasize that the collected data will be\nhandled according to thestrictest possible norms to guarantee compliance with the no harm\nprinciple. This includes confidentiality and securehandling and storage of data. As also included\nin the verbal informed consent, should any concerns, demands or questionsarise, the participants\ncan always contact the researcher.\nThe researcher recognizes the importance of both (1) external confidentiality and (2) internal\nconfidentiality. (1) External confidentiality. For the interviews with the research participants of\ndifferent age groups, the age, gender and general place of residence – i.e., the capacity in which\nthe respondent is being interviewed – will constitute the labels used forthe identification of the\nrespondents’ interviews. These will also be the only identifiers that could appear in the reporting\nof the results in both academic papers and the PhD thesis. Pseudonymization of data will avoid\nlinking the respondents with the data collected, starting from the point of collection. The\nrecordings and the fieldnotes will never contain personal identifiers such as names, telephone\nnumbers or addresses. This information will be stored on the One Drive for Business of the KU\nLeuven and will not be stored on mobile phones. \n(2) Internal confidentiality. Especially for the interviews with Cuban activists in Havana, a rather\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 5\nsmall, connected community, also internalconfidentiality will be provided. When disclosing\nquotes or examples of these participants, the researcher will consider at all time whether the\nparticipant can be identified – either by outsiders or by people close to the participant – and, if\nthe case, take measures to avoid this by disclosing any identifiable characters of the individuals\nor changing identifiable characteristics (e.g. gender) if irrelevant to the quote. Whenever\nparticular contextual characteristics are necessary in order to understand a quote, the researcher\nwill only mention those for that specific quote, rather than connecting the characteristics to this\nspecific individual which can be traced throughout the PhD thesis. Through the combination of\nthese measures, both external and internal confidentiality can be guaranteed for the research\nparticipants. \nThis internal and external confidnentiality constitute the basis for good documentation of the\ndata collected. It highlights which personal data can be included in the documentation of the\ncollected data and forms the guidelines for the pseudonymization process. The data that will be\ncollected constitues of 1) participant observations and 2) semi-structured interviews. For the\nparticipant observation (1) written fieldnotes will be taken. Initially I will use descriptive\nobservation to include a broad range of observations in my field notes (Werner & Schoepfle,\n1987). Subsequently, after having identified various broad themes through an inductive,\nthematic analysis of the descriptive observations, I will move towards selective observation\n(ibid). The selected bottom-up approach allows for themes to arise that may otherwise not have\nbeen anticipated, enabling me to categorize and gaining insights in individual experiences of\nfood access. Through thematic analysis, I will be able to further deepen the observations on\nthese themes and ask specific questions during small talk. The semi-structured interviews will\nstart off with small talk, mainly about food provisioning. This will allow the research participant to\nshare some initial thoughts on thetopic, which will then allow for follow-up questions to gain\nfurther understanding of how access to food, and food provisioning, plays a role in their daily life.\nHereafter, depending on how much the participants wants to share, a question will be posed\nabout social mobilization around food issues. Hereby events which have also been reported in\nCuban statemedia (i.e. protests about animal welfare, LGBTQI protests (incl. yearly march),\nprotest on 11 July 2021) will be referred to, to see/ask how the participants view these protests. If\nthe research participant is comfortable sharing, the topic will move more into the relationship\nbetween food access and social mobilization. The interview will be recorded and transcribed,\nwhereafter the recording and the transcipt will be safely stored in the J-drive for future use and\nanalysis. \nThe whole papertrail and safely stored documentation of this doctoral research will be handed\nover to the supervisor of the doctoral candidate after the research, to be safely stored in a closed\ncloset only accessible to him.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nData integrity will be observed at all times. Raw material (e.g. interview recordings and\ntranscripts) will be well organized and securely stored in the KU Leuven’s external drive ‘LUNA’,\nand stored and encrypted on an external hard drive for times when internet is unavailable. The\nLUNA drive has an automatic backup. Fieldnotes (e.g. derived from participant observation),\nfurthermore, will never contain any personal information or addresses, and will be securely\nstored in a drawer only accessible to the researcher. All the data will be available to both the\npromotor and co-promotor of the PhD candidate.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe KU Leuven's external drive 'LUNA' has an automatic backup. Additionally, in the case internet\nis very slow (often the context in Cuba) a backup copy will be made on an password protected\nand encrypted (with Bitlocker) external harddrive. Once the internet speed allows again, the data\nwill be uploaded to the J drive (LUNA)  and the copy on the external harddrive will be deleted. The\nOne Drive for Business cloud space managed by KU Leuven, which also has an automatic backup\nsystem, will be used to store the data in pseudonymized form.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 5\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nTogether with the rollout of Office 365 there is standard 2TB personal OneDrive cloud storage\n(incl. backup) available for KU Leuven employees. This is enough capacity for the data collected\nduring this research. \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nThe costs are included in the admission fee (collegegeld) paid by the doctoral student for her\naffiliation with the KU Leuven, and are not expected to go beyond this fee. \nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nText and audio messages will be transferred to the login and password protected J drive under\nthe KU Leuven 'LUNA' domain soon after the exchange has ended and subsequently deleted from\nthe web chat environment. The external harddrive used for when internet accessibility is low will\nonly be used when needed; the first option is to safely store the data to the protected KU Leuven\ndomain which has an automatic backup system. Confidentiality rules also apply to the use of\ncontent from sources (see also previous sections of this DMP). The data will only be accessible to\nthe researcher and the supervisors. After finishing the research project, the data will be handed\nover to the KU Leuven supervisor who will continue to safely store it (both digitally and the\npapertrail in terms of fieldnotes) in a place only accessible to him. \n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nThe (personal) data will be saved on the secured network drive of the KU Leuven (J-drive) and the\nOneDrive linked to the researchers' KU Leuven Account. The (personal) data will be deleted after\n10 years according to the KU Leuven RDM-guidelines.\n \nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nThe (personal) data will be saved on the secured networkdrive of the KU Leuven (J-drive) and the\nOneDrive (with automatic backup procedures) linked to the researchers' KU Leuven Account. The\n(personal) data will be deleted after 10 years according to the KU Leuven RDM-guidelines.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nNo additional costs will be expected for data preservation. \n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nNo\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nThe data retreived during the course of this research will, apart from the data used in published\narticles, only be made available to the supervisor and co-supervisor of this research.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nOther (specify):\nThe data retreived during the course of this research will, apart from the data used in published\narticles, only be made available to the supervisor and co-supervisor of this research.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nThe data retreived during the course of this research will, apart from the data used in published\narticles, only be made available to the supervisor and co-supervisor of this research.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 5\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nSee also PRET file - G-2022-4979\nDuring the research the fieldnotes and other data collected on paper by the researcher will be\nsafely stored in a drawer that can be closed and is only accessible to the researcher. After\nfinishing this research project, all the papers will be handed over to the supervisor at the KU\nLeuven who will continue to store the papertrail safely in a closet/drawer only accessible to him.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nNo additional costs are expected for data sharing. \n8. Responsibilities\nWho will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?\nThe researcher, under supervision of and in consultation with the supervisor and co-supervisor, is\nresponsible for data documentation. \nWho will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nThe researcher, under supervision of and in consultation with the supervisor and co-supervisor, is\nresponsible for data storage and backup during the project. \nWho will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ?\nThe researcher, under supervision of and in consultation with the supervisor and co-supervisor, is\nresponsible for data preservation and reuse. \nWho bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nThe PI bears the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n5 of 5"
