Cryo-EM has undoubtedly resulted in a breakthrough in the field by determining the structures of tau fibrils at atomic\nresolution, but this approach is limited to extracted end-state fibrillar aggregates. The early stages of AD (especially the structural analysis\nof the early-forming non-fibrillar tau species) have been neglected so far. I will utilize an innovative approach, atomic-force microscopy-\nbased infrared absorption (AFM-IR) coupled with fluorescence microscopy. I will obtain in situ structural information of the transient and\nheterogeneous conformational changes occurring during tau aggregation as well as investigate interactions with other proteins, lipids,\nand nucleic acids that may potentially act as co-aggregators. I will thoroughly screen the structural characteristics of tau amyloid strains in\nsitu, starting from the early stages of pathology/disease both in human cases and mouse models. I will correlate the identified structural\nproperties of tau aggregates with both their maturation state and seeding potential. My findings will deepen our understanding of how the\ndistinct tau strains are formed and relate to the characteristic spreading patterns of tau neuropathology.\n \nLast modified: \n05-04-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Ethical approval reference number: 184/2020 \nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 05 April 2023\n7 of 10\nWill you process personal data? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate.\nNo\nNA\nDoes your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type\nwhere appropriate.\nNo\nWe do not exclude that the proposed work could result in research data with the potential for tech transfer and valorization. VIB and KU Leuven have a policy to actively monitor research data for\nsuch potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of cases, the invention will be IP-protected (mostly patent protection or copyright\nprotection). As such IP protection does not withhold the research data from being made public. In the case a decision is taken to file a patent application it will be planned so that publications need\nnot be delayed. Further research beyond the scope of this project may be necessary for developing a strong IP portfolio.\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements/ research collaboration agreements)? If so,\nplease explain in the comment section to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.\nNo\nNA\nAre there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain in the comment section to\nwhat data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.\nNo\nNA\n2. Documentation and Metadata\nClearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in\nthe future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is\nrecorded).\nMetadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook) and/or in\nhard copy lab notebooks that refer to specific datasets. All datasets will be accompanied by a README.txt file containing all the associated metadata. The data will be generated following\nstandardized protocols. Clear and detailed descriptions of these protocols will be stored in our lab protocol database, and published along with the results.\nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be\nused. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nDigital files will be named following a standard procedure so that all the names of all files in a given dataset will be in the same format: All names will start with the date (and time if applicable),\nfollowed by the project acronym, a short but specific descriptive name and a version number (containing leading zeros as needed) if applicable. Whenever possible names will be kept under 32\ncharacters. Names will only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. Dots will only be used for version control indicators (minor revisions indicated by decimal numbers, and major revisions by\nwhole numbers): YYYYMMDD_HHmm_Project_Experiment_ version.format\nAll changes in the files will be recorded. Data files will be stored in suitably labeled and organized folders and sub-folders, accompanied by a README.txt file in the top-level directory of the\ndataset, containing all the associated metadata. This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse. File names\nand locations will be recorded in the E-notebook to allow electronic records to be linked to the raw data.\nMetadata will include the following elements:\n• Title: free text\n• Creator: Last name, first name, organization\n• Date and time reference\n• Subject: Choice of keywords and classifications\n• Description: Text explaining the content of the data set and other contextual information needed for the correct interpretation of the data, the software(s) (including version number) used to\nproduce and to read the data, the purpose of the experiment, etc.\n• Format: Details of the file format,\n• Resource Type: data set, image, audio, etc.\n• Identifier: DOI (when applicable)\n• Access rights: closed access, embargoed access, restricted access, open access.\n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nDigital files will be stored either on KU Leuven servers or in shared laboratory folders of an off-site online backup service. The researchers working on the project will have copies of the data files\nas well as of the derived and compiled data stored on their personal computers.\nThe Switch Lab has a professional subscription to an off-site online backup service with unlimited space, version control, and roll-back capability, which will be used for storage during the project\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

There is a secondary on-campus physical backup of the online storage which synchronizes with the online content with a one-day delay.\nAlgorithms, scripts, and softwares: All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software code driving the project will be stored in a private online git repository from the GitHub account of the\ndepartment (https://github.com/vibcbd).\nThe imaging/screening core has a database system in place to handle the data stream from the high-content imaging screen, including archiving facilities, and will store the data during the\nproject. Representative images and the quantitation of the images will be transferred to the Switch laboratory storage for long-term storage.\nCell lines: Newly created cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid nitrogen storage and will be deposited in the UZ Leuven-KU Leuven Biobank.\nHuman Samples: Stained sections and residual tissue from autopsy cases will be stored in UZ Leuven biobank\nMouse Samples: Tissues will be stored at -80°C and stained sections will be stored at room temperature or/and 4°C\nOther biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C, -20°C, or -80°C  and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nThe Switch Lab has a professional subscription to an off-site online backup service with unlimited space, version control and roll-back capability, which will be used for storage during the project\nand after. There is a secondary on-campus physical backup of the online storage which synchronizes with the online content with a one-day delay. We also use standard back-up provided by KU\nLeuven ICTS.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThe Switch Lab has a professional subscription to an off-site online backup service with unlimited space, which will be used for storage during the project and after.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nAll notebooks and physical data are stored in the labs. Entry to the lab requires ID-card and key. Access to the digital data is u-number and password controlled.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nData storage and backup costs are included in general lab costs. The Switch Lab has a yearly subscription to an off-site online backup service paid from the general budget of the laboratory. The\nyearly cost of the service is 5500 Euros. This cost includes unlimited data storage, not only the data belonging to the present project. Electricity costs for the -80° and -20° freezers and\nrefrigerators present in the labs as well as the cost of liquid nitrogen cryostorage are included in general lab costs.\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be\npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\nThe minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets.\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nAs a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of publication.\nFor all other datasets, long-term storage will be ensured as follows:\n-Digital datasets will be stored in the storage space of an online data backup service.\n-Cell lines: Newly created cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid nitrogen storage and will be deposited in the UZ Leuven-KU Leuven Biobank.\n-For Human Samples and sections: Tissues and stained sections will be stored in the UZ Leuven biobank.\n-Mouse Samples: Tissues will be stored at -80°C and stained sections will be stored at room temperature or/and 4°C.\nOther biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C, -20°C or -80°C  and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate.\n \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nElectricity costs for the -80° and -20° freezers and refrigerators present in the labs as well as for liquid nitrogen cryostorage are included in general lab costs. The cost of the laboratory's\nprofessional subscription to the online data backup service is 5500 Euros per year (27 500 Euros for 5 years). This cost includes unlimited data storage, not only the data belonging to the present\nproject. Data storage and backup costs are included in general lab costs.\n5. Data sharing and reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made\navailable.\nYes, in an Open Access repository\nParticipants in the present project are committed to publishing research results to communicate them to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made\nopenly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new collaborators, or\npublicly via repositories (e.g. negative data). We aim at communicating our results in top journals that require full disclosure upon publication of all included data, either in the main text, in\nsupplementary material, or in a data repository if requested by the journal and following deposit advice given by the journal. Depending on the journal, accessibility restrictions may apply. Physical\ndata (e.g. cell lines) will be distributed to other parties if requested.\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 05 April 2023\n9 of 10\nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.\nNA\nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment\nsection per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nNo\nNA\nWhere will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.\nThe data will be shared upon request by mail.\nPossible ways of sharing the generated data\nHuman tissue: BioBank (\nhttps://www.uzleuven.be/nl/biobank\n)\ncell lines: direct mailing on dry ice\nmicroscope images: Image Data Resource (\nhttp://idr.openmicroscopy.org/about/\n)\nmanuscripts: bioRxiv (\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/\n)\nother digital data: Zenodo data repository (\nhttps://zenodo.org/\n)\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nGenerally, research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at the time of publication. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, potential IP\nrequirements – note that patent application filing will be planned so that publications need not be delayed - or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be made\npublicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached.\n \nWhich data usage licenses are you going to provide?

Cryo-EM has undoubtedly resulted in a breakthrough in the field by determining the structures of tau fibrils at atomic resolution, but this approach is limited to extracted end-state fibrillar aggregates. The early stages of AD (especially the structural analysis of the early-forming non-fibrillar tau species) have been neglected so far. I will utilize an innovative approach, atomic-force microscopy- based infrared absorption (AFM-IR) coupled with fluorescence microscopy. I will obtain in situ structural information of the transient and heterogeneous conformational changes occurring during tau aggregation as well as investigate interactions with other proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that may potentially act as co-aggregators. I will thoroughly screen the structural characteristics of tau amyloid strains in situ, starting from the early stages of pathology/disease both in human cases and mouse models. I will correlate the identified structural properties of tau aggregates with both their maturation state and seeding potential. My findings will deepen our understanding of how the distinct tau strains are formed and relate to the characteristic spreading patterns of tau neuropathology.

If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. No NA Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. No We do not exclude that the proposed work could result in research data with the potential for tech transfer and valorization. VIB and KU Leuven have a policy to actively monitor research data for such potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of cases, the invention will be IP-protected (mostly patent protection or copyright protection). As such IP protection does not withhold the research data from being made public. In the case a decision is taken to file a patent application it will be planned so that publications need not be delayed. Further research beyond the scope of this project may be necessary for developing a strong IP portfolio. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements/ research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. No NA Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. No NA 2. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook) and/or in hard copy lab notebooks that refer to specific datasets. All datasets will be accompanied by a README.txt file containing all the associated metadata. The data will be generated following standardized protocols. Clear and detailed descriptions of these protocols will be stored in our lab protocol database, and published along with the results. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. No Digital files will be named following a standard procedure so that all the names of all files in a given dataset will be in the same format: All names will start with the date (and time if applicable), followed by the project acronym, a short but specific descriptive name and a version number (containing leading zeros as needed) if applicable. Whenever possible names will be kept under 32 characters. Names will only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. Dots will only be used for version control indicators (minor revisions indicated by decimal numbers, and major revisions by whole numbers): YYYYMMDD_HHmm_Project_Experiment_ version.format All changes in the files will be recorded. Data files will be stored in suitably labeled and organized folders and sub-folders, accompanied by a README.txt file in the top-level directory of the dataset, containing all the associated metadata. This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse. File names and locations will be recorded in the E-notebook to allow electronic records to be linked to the raw data. Metadata will include the following elements: • Title: free text • Creator: Last name, first name, organization • Date and time reference • Subject: Choice of keywords and classifications • Description: Text explaining the content of the data set and other contextual information needed for the correct interpretation of the data, the software(s) (including version number) used to produce and to read the data, the purpose of the experiment, etc. • Format: Details of the file format, • Resource Type: data set, image, audio, etc. • Identifier: DOI (when applicable) • Access rights: closed access, embargoed access, restricted access, open access. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Digital files will be stored either on KU Leuven servers or in shared laboratory folders of an off-site online backup service. The researchers working on the project will have copies of the data files as well as of the derived and compiled data stored on their personal computers. The Switch Lab has a professional subscription to an off-site online backup service with unlimited space, version control, and roll-back capability, which will be used for storage during the project Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 05 April 2023 8 of 10 and after. There is a secondary on-campus physical backup of the online storage which synchronizes with the online content with a one-day delay. Algorithms, scripts, and softwares: All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software code driving the project will be stored in a private online git repository from the GitHub account of the department (https://github.com/vibcbd). The imaging/screening core has a database system in place to handle the data stream from the high-content imaging screen, including archiving facilities, and will store the data during the project. Representative images and the quantitation of the images will be transferred to the Switch laboratory storage for long-term storage. Cell lines: Newly created cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid nitrogen storage and will be deposited in the UZ Leuven-KU Leuven Biobank. Human Samples: Stained sections and residual tissue from autopsy cases will be stored in UZ Leuven biobank Mouse Samples: Tissues will be stored at -80°C and stained sections will be stored at room temperature or/and 4°C Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C, -20°C, or -80°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate. How will the data be backed up? The Switch Lab has a professional subscription to an off-site online backup service with unlimited space, version control and roll-back capability, which will be used for storage during the project and after. There is a secondary on-campus physical backup of the online storage which synchronizes with the online content with a one-day delay. We also use standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes The Switch Lab has a professional subscription to an off-site online backup service with unlimited space, which will be used for storage during the project and after. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? All notebooks and physical data are stored in the labs. Entry to the lab requires ID-card and key. Access to the digital data is u-number and password controlled. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Data storage and backup costs are included in general lab costs. The Switch Lab has a yearly subscription to an off-site online backup service paid from the general budget of the laboratory. The yearly cost of the service is 5500 Euros. This cost includes unlimited data storage, not only the data belonging to the present project. Electricity costs for the -80° and -20° freezers and refrigerators present in the labs as well as the cost of liquid nitrogen cryostorage are included in general lab costs. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). The minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of publication. For all other datasets, long-term storage will be ensured as follows: -Digital datasets will be stored in the storage space of an online data backup service. -Cell lines: Newly created cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid nitrogen storage and will be deposited in the UZ Leuven-KU Leuven Biobank. -For Human Samples and sections: Tissues and stained sections will be stored in the UZ Leuven biobank. -Mouse Samples: Tissues will be stored at -80°C and stained sections will be stored at room temperature or/and 4°C. Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C, -20°C or -80°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Electricity costs for the -80° and -20° freezers and refrigerators present in the labs as well as for liquid nitrogen cryostorage are included in general lab costs. The cost of the laboratory's professional subscription to the online data backup service is 5500 Euros per year (27 500 Euros for 5 years). This cost includes unlimited data storage, not only the data belonging to the present project. Data storage and backup costs are included in general lab costs. 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in an Open Access repository Participants in the present project are committed to publishing research results to communicate them to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made openly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new collaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. negative data). We aim at communicating our results in top journals that require full disclosure upon publication of all included data, either in the main text, in supplementary material, or in a data repository if requested by the journal and following deposit advice given by the journal. Depending on the journal, accessibility restrictions may apply. Physical data (e.g. cell lines) will be distributed to other parties if requested. Created using DMPonline.be.
