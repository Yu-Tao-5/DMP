It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all materials tha t need proper management because they are valuable, diffic ult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentation/metadata. RDM Guidance on data FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9 If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type . There will be made use of published papers and books from (digital) libraries , movies (streaming and DVD) , and unpublished archives (exhibitions , photographs and drawing series ). - Any textual data collected digitally (online) : this concerns research articles and publicly available reviews. Whenever possible, these data will be stored with a specific date, and timestamp wil l be added to it, preserving the state in which these data found themselves when I accessed them . - Any audiovisual data collected online: this concerns publicly available digitized movies , usually on streaming platforms with a paywal l. Protected by copyright . I will work with screenshots and extracts. - Any unpublished archives data collected digitally: this concerns photo and drawing series that have been the object of a physical or digital exhibition. These are under copyright; some artists - on a case -by-case basis - have given me a written permission to store the digitized (.pdf or .jpg) version of their series as a data for my research. They will not be publicly available; or at least not the entirety of the series. P ermission is needed from the copyright holder(s). Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number . ☐ Yes, human subject data ; provide SMEC or EC a pproval number: ☐ Yes, animal data ; provide ECD reference number: ☐ Yes, dual use; provide approva l number : ☒ No Additional information : Will you process personal data4?

If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes , please comment : Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements , research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please explain: I am committed to providing my generated output as open source as much as possible. I have received the permission to access and reuse some photographs and include them in O pen Access publications, from copyright holders and will properly cite the movies and use screenshots from movies to illustrate (as these fall under the exceptional conditions of citation). 3. Documentation and Metadata FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11 Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata . - Bibliographic references will be organised in Zotero, in different folders per subject, and with tags. They are linked to the digital files. - Personal writings will be stored in structured folders per publication and PhD chapter on KU Leuven Onedrive. - Alongside my data, I will work with two README.txt files sets, 1) A general -level README.txt file which will provide general documentation regarding the project itself 2) A file -folder -level README.txt file which will provide more specific documentations concerning a specific file and/or folder. Notes for further study will be accessible with a README.txt file which includes a description of the context in which data was generated, to which research project the data belongs, and how the data should be interpreted. - The unpublished archive (photographs and past exhibitions) will be stored in structured folders on KU Leuven Onedrive. These won’t be openly accessible for public as they are protected by copyright. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : This project will adopt the Dublin Core metadata standard and , when it comes to audiovisual sources and visual art, it will adopt the Visual Resources Association (VRA) Core metadata standard . This data will be generated with the open -source program Zotero . If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12 Where will the data be stored?
