Furthermore, the European Union has\nincorporated this commitment to climate action through the European Climate Law, effective since July 29, 2021. This legislation mandates achieving\nclimate neutrality by 2050 and reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030. One of the technological pathways outlined in the ERA\nindustrial technology roadmap to achieve this objective is through electrification, using electricity generated from sustainable sources as the primary\nenergy source. This challenges current chemical industry norms. Addressing this, the HITEC center is established (https://hitec-center.eu/) with a\ndistinctive portfolio that enables the aforementioned transition by offering solutions for batch-to-flow conversion, electricity-based activation (such as\nthrough light, sound, and electrochemical processes), and electricity-based stimulation of fluid flow to improve mixing. However, our technologies are\ncurrently at a TRL of 3-4, validated in laboratory settings. The aim is to raise them to TRL 5-6, where they are validated and demonstrated in an\nindustrially-relevant setting. This project aims to bridge the gap by: (1) Expanding of the range of operating conditions and catering to the specific\nneeds of processes by enhancing realization capabilities using CNC technology in the development phase; (2) Development of complete system designs\nwith online analysis capability and definition of control systems and philosophies to facilitate faster testing, data collection, and evaluation in the\ndesign & maturation phases; (3) Demonstration of better readiness for handling various process environments with industrial-relevant case studies\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n13-05-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
