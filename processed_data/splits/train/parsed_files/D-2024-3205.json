The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID David Burn (0000-0002-9137-9591)\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Toon Van Waterschoot  (0000-0002-6323-7350) – KU Leuven ESAT-STADIUS : co-supervisor WP2\nMike Kestemont (0000-0003-3590-693X) – Universiteit Antwerpen : co-supervisor WP3\nBart Demuyt (0000-0003-2902-552X) – Alamire Foundation : co-supervisor WP1\nBram Caers (0000-0001-7482-3198) - Leiden University  : co-supervisor WP4\nProject number 1 & title S005525N \nNEW PERSPECTIVES ON MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE COURTLY SONG\nFunder(s) GrantID 2S005525N\nAffiliation(s) ☒ KU Leuven \n☒ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☒ Other:\nAlamire Foundation\nLeiden University\nROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\nROR identifier Universiteit Antwerpen: 008x57b05\nROR identifier Alamire Foundation: 00vrf8x48\nROR identifier Leiden University: 027bh9e22\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

However, \nthe performance of the music contained in the fifteenth-century manuscript is jeopardized by the more \nthan five centuries that separate medieval composers and today's musicians.\nFrom the initial results of the research conducted to bridge this gap, it appears important to transcend the \ncase of the Leuven Chansonnier and to integrate it into its broader musical, literary, and historical context \nthrough multidisciplinary research. At the same time, the the research that this entails pushes the limits of  \ntraditional analysis. The response to this situation lies in data production through innovative technology \nand AI-driven processes. The methodology developed for this purpose is expected to prove applicable in \nother domains of the humanities.\nStarting from the case of the Leuven Chansonnier, \"New Perspectives on Medieval and Renaissance \nCourtly Song\" addresses a multifaceted set of questions. Specifically, it involves  \n(1) multidisciplinary research into the broader societal and cultural context within which the Leuven \nChansonnier and the extensive corpus of sources related to it were produced and circulated;  \n(2) innovative research into the architecture and acoustics of the spaces in which the source corpus in \ngeneral, and the Leuven Chansonnier in particular, were performed; and the transposition of the resulting \ndata and insights into a contemporary performance context;  \n(3) the integration of the achieved results and their dissemination both through academic and practice-\noriented research and via international, national, regional, and local valorization platforms that aim to \nprovide an authentic heritage experience to a wide audience.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 4List and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

The text data includes, but is \nnot limited to, location, time, historical context, possible links to the musical corpus studied in this project,  \nand a description of the room type according to standard AES69-2022. Specifically, for the acoustic \nmeasurements, the equipment used to generate and record the sound signals will be detailed in a rich text  \ndocument in which pictures of the experimental setup will be included in as well. Moreover, all source and  \nmicrophone positions used for the sound generation and recording will be accurately measured and their \n3-D coordinates will be saved in a CSV file. For sources and microphones that follow a dynamic spatial \ntrajectory during the recordings, the 3-D coordinates of a set of positions along the trajectory will be saved  \nin a CSV file along with the corresponding time stamps. These CSV files will also be published along with \nthe data.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 12Datasets WP2.2&2.3 (Space):  \nThe descriptive part of the metadata for the audio file type and 3D video file type of recordings of music \nperformances contains linked information: in a first phase the recordings will be documented using text \nand pictures. Descriptive text will include data such as (and not limited to):  performing ensemble, \nperformers (number of, name, ...), director, composition, composer, location, type of microphones used, \nmicrophone positions, etc..  Pictures will further illustrate this. In a second phase, with the integration into  \nIDEM, metadata distilled from this information will ensure full interoperability between the audio file type \nand 3D video file type , and also to other data types within IDEM.\nDatasets WP3.1-3.3 (Text):\nAny data, software and models will be accompanied by a technical README (in markdown format) in the \nrespective repositories (Zenodo and GitHub).

A customised data model was developed by LIBIS (KU Leuven). The data model meets the \nresearch questions and the metadata needs recorded by the Alamire Foundation (KU Leuven). Special \nattention is given to the interrelations between the different data types: the integration of also audio files \n(audiorecordings of performances) and 3D video files (recordings of the same performances) into the \nIDEM data model; the addition of also the 3D models of spaces to the LIBIS data model.\nDatasets WP3.1-3.3 (Text):\n☒ Yes\n☐ No\nThe project will use publicly documented open standards, such as UTF-8 encoded text files, in particular \nXML for hierarchical data modelling need and tabular spreadsheet formats (XLSX). An earlier paper that \nrelied on this approach can be found here: https://zenodo.org/records/14732466 .  This repository \nillustrates how similar research have been shared before using FAIR principles. Any data, software and \nmodels will be accompanied by a technical README in the respective repositories (Zenodo and GitHub). \nOn Zenodo, the distributed datasets will be assigned a DOI to increase the discoverability of the datasets. \nThis file will detail the origin, current version and software requirements.\nDatasets WP4.1-4.3 (Networks):\n☒ Yes\n☐ No\nWe will cater our metadata to the standard used by the destination platform. Following the FAIR \nprinciples, we will opt for a widely shared standard such as MARC21, which can be catered to specific \nneeds, for example in capturing the bibliographic irregularities of Medieval Manuscript material.

The FWO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.

FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 3Please provide a short project description The Franco-Flemish polyphony preserved in the recently discovered Leuven Chansonnier belongs to European heritage that stands artistically at the same level as the Flemish Primitives' paintings. However, the performance of the music contained in the fifteenth-century manuscript is jeopardized by the more than five centuries that separate medieval composers and today's musicians. From the initial results of the research conducted to bridge this gap, it appears important to transcend the case of the Leuven Chansonnier and to integrate it into its broader musical, literary, and historical context through multidisciplinary research. At the same time, the the research that this entails pushes the limits of traditional analysis. The response to this situation lies in data production through innovative technology and AI-driven processes. The methodology developed for this purpose is expected to prove applicable in other domains of the humanities. Starting from the case of the Leuven Chansonnier, \"New Perspectives on Medieval and Renaissance Courtly Song\" addresses a multifaceted set of questions. Specifically, it involves (1) multidisciplinary research into the broader societal and cultural context within which the Leuven Chansonnier and the extensive corpus of sources related to it were produced and circulated; (2) innovative research into the architecture and acoustics of the spaces in which the source corpus in general, and the Leuven Chansonnier in particular, were performed; and the transposition of the resulting data and insights into a contemporary performance context; (3) the integration of the achieved results and their dissemination both through academic and practice- oriented research and via international, national, regional, and local valorization platforms that aim to provide an authentic heritage experience to a wide audience.

RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .Dataset WP1.1 (Music): During ingest images are processed by means of a precise method of filenaming so that individual files can be easily identified after ingest. In case of clear separate production units inside sources, a specific table of content is provided to aid in navigating the source. This happens by means of a metadata-file (.xlsx) and uses a Dublin core metadata standard. Dataset WP1.2 (Music): Data is gathered directly in the developed datamodel in CollectiveAccess manualy of by means of data import. Sufficient datafields are provided to give the necessary documentation and notes. Dataset WP1.3 (Music): A clear folder structure is sufficient since the dataset consists of rather individual work documents. Dataset WP2.1 (Space): For each room that is modelled the raw measurement data is collected, accompanied by a text file with a clear description of its representation, and an image thumb file of the room. The text data includes, but is not limited to, location, time, historical context, possible links to the musical corpus studied in this project, and a description of the room type according to standard AES69-2022. Specifically, for the acoustic measurements, the equipment used to generate and record the sound signals will be detailed in a rich text document in which pictures of the experimental setup will be included in as well. Moreover, all source and microphone positions used for the sound generation and recording will be accurately measured and their 3-D coordinates will be saved in a CSV file. For sources and microphones that follow a dynamic spatial trajectory during the recordings, the 3-D coordinates of a set of positions along the trajectory will be saved in a CSV file along with the corresponding time stamps. These CSV files will also be published along with the data. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12Datasets WP2.2&2.3 (Space): The descriptive part of the metadata for the audio file type and 3D video file type of recordings of music performances contains linked information: in a first phase the recordings will be documented using text and pictures. Descriptive text will include data such as (and not limited to): performing ensemble, performers (number of, name, ...), director, composition, composer, location, type of microphones used, microphone positions, etc.. Pictures will further illustrate this. In a second phase, with the integration into IDEM, metadata distilled from this information will ensure full interoperability between the audio file type and 3D video file type , and also to other data types within IDEM. Datasets WP3.1-3.3 (Text): Any data, software and models will be accompanied by a technical README (in markdown format) in the respective repositories (Zenodo and GitHub). On Zenodo, the distributed datasets will be assigned a DOI to increase the discoverability of the datasets. This file will detail the origin, current version and rationale of the relevant files. Datasets WP4.1-4.3 (Networks): Data will be made available to the highest degree possible through existing (metadata) platforms, channeling back refined information into the source reference works that we used as a starting point. As a complete collection, the gathered data will be made accessible through DANS https://dans.knaw.nl/nl/ ; or through Zenodo. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.Dataset WP1.1 (Music): ☒ Yes ☐ No The mapping template for ingesting basic metadata related to the digital object into the long-term preservation (LTP) system uses the Dublin Core (DC) standard. Both DC elements and DC terms are available; The digital representations (JPEG2000) stored in Rosetta are represented as IIIF manifest files. These manifest files describe the structure of the object and associated metadata according to the specifications of the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF). This allows the digital objects to be visualized easily and anywhere in the world in any IIIF compliant viewer application. Mirador was chosen as viewer application and customized for the IDEM database in order to easily place images from different sources next to each other for comparative research; Dataset WP1.2&3 (Music): ☒ Yes ☐ No The specialized datamodel for descriptive metadata in CollectiveAccess can be linked to Dublin Core metadata standards, amongst others. Connections to other widely known databases as Répertoire International des Sources Musicales (RISM), and CantusDatabase contribute to the findability and reusability of the data. For authority records, connection is made with standards as VIAF. Datasets WP2.1-2.3 (Space): ☐ Yes ☒ No FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 14Since no formally acknowledged metadata standard specific to our discipline exists, no metadata standard will be used. A customised data model was developed by LIBIS (KU Leuven). The data model meets the research questions and the metadata needs recorded by the Alamire Foundation (KU Leuven). Special attention is given to the interrelations between the different data types: the integration of also audio files (audiorecordings of performances) and 3D video files (recordings of the same performances) into the IDEM data model; the addition of also the 3D models of spaces to the LIBIS data model. Datasets WP3.1-3.3 (Text): ☒ Yes ☐ No The project will use publicly documented open standards, such as UTF-8 encoded text files, in particular XML for hierarchical data modelling need and tabular spreadsheet formats (XLSX). An earlier paper that relied on this approach can be found here: https://zenodo.org/records/14732466 . This repository illustrates how similar research have been shared before using FAIR principles. Any data, software and models will be accompanied by a technical README in the respective repositories (Zenodo and GitHub). On Zenodo, the distributed datasets will be assigned a DOI to increase the discoverability of the datasets. This file will detail the origin, current version and software requirements. Datasets WP4.1-4.3 (Networks): ☒ Yes ☐ No We will cater our metadata to the standard used by the destination platform. Following the FAIR principles, we will opt for a widely shared standard such as MARC21, which can be catered to specific needs, for example in capturing the bibliographic irregularities of Medieval Manuscript material.
