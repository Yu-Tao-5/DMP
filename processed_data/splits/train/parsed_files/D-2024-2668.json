Electrons and protons in the plasma often exhibit nonequilibrium features in their velocity distribution functions, resulting in\nanisotropies that can give rise to kinetic microinstabilities and electromagnetic waves. Plasma particles can also gain energy through heating and\nscattering phenomena caused by these waves. Furthermore, the adiabatic radial expansion of the solar wind and the ubiquitous presence of magnetic\nfield switchbacks influence the thermodynamics of the system, thereby changing the configuration of equilibria. In this proposal, we aim to study the\nkinetics of solar wind plasma through cutting edge numerical simulations, developing a new model that extends microscale simulations of plasma to the\nmacroscale of switchbacks. We will use advanced numerical methods that are suitable for studying plasma physics at both the microscopic and\nmacroscopic scales to accomplish this goal. Our study will bridge the gap between the physics of microprocesses and the behavior of plasma at a larger\nscale that is currently lacking in state-of-the-art models. By conducting numerical simulations of solar wind plasma based on Parker Solar Probe in situ\nobservations, we will gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of solar wind plasma and contribute to fundamental advancements in plasma physics.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n26-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

To ensure the reproducibility of our research, all data that leads to publications will be stored for at least 5 years after the project's completion. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Regular backups will be performed by the IT staff. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes To acquire computational hours, we conduct both weak and strong scaling tests on the VSC cluster before initiating each simulation. This procedure aids us in gauging the required computational power and estimating the necessary disk storage for archiving the database. As a result, prior to each simulation, we accurately assess the disk space required, ensuring optimal resource allocation. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? All data and model source codes will be managed in strict compliance with IT guidelines, including password protection for all computers and external drives. Our IT staff continuously implements security upgrades to ensure robust protection. When sharing datasets, read-only permissions will be enforced to maintain data integrity and security.

What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? We do not anticipate incurring any supplementary expenses for data storage or backup, aside from the ongoing operational costs associated with the IT department, which is covered by KU Leuven. 4.
