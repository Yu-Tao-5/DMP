Normal T-cell development is well studied and the majority of genomic changes in T-ALL are\nknown. From these data, there is clear evidence that chromatin structure, transcription and translation are major processes that are\nderegulated in T-ALL, but how specific mutations cooperate to change chromatin, gene expression and protein translation remains poorly\nstudied. In this project, we aim to deconvolute T-ALL development at single-cell resolution in accurate mouse models of T-ALL by\nmapping chromatin, transcriptional and in particular protein changes from the early stages of leukemia initiation to the progression\ntowards acute disease. Moreover, we aim to map the interactions of developing leukemia cells with normal cells and determine how\ntranscriptional/translational inhibitors affect leukemia cell function.\nLast modified: \n10-05-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
