A collaboration with the centre of drug discovery and\ndevelopment has resulted in the identification of a class of TRPM3 antagonists, including a preclinical candidate drug with\nefficacy in different preclinical pain models and an excellent safety profile (two patents filed). However, our drug development\nproject still has some important lacunas that hinder partnering and progression toward phase I studies. The aim of this project\nis to investigate the role of TRPM3 and the long-term efficacy, and safety of our first-in-class TRPM3 antagonist in relevant\nmodels of neuropathic pain. Moreover, we will evaluate the possibility that TRPM3 inhibitors can be use prophylactically, to\nprevent the development of the neuropathic pain. The successful execution of this project will provide the needed preclinical\ndata to advance our program towards clinical studies.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at\nthe time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook) and/or in\nhard copy lab notebooks that refer to specific datasets. The data will be generated following standardized protocols. Clear and\ndetailed descriptions of these protocols will be stored in our lab protocol database, and published along with the results.\n4.2. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used. If not, state in detail\nwhich metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nMetadata will include the following elements: • Title: free text • Creator: Last name, first name, organization • Date and time\nreference • Subject: Choice of keywords and classifications • Description: Text explaining the content of the data set and other\ncontextual information needed for the correct interpretation of the data, the software(s) (including version number) used to\nproduce and to read the data, the purpose of the experiment, etc. • Format: Details of the file format, • Resource Type: data\nset, image, audio, etc. • Identifier: DOI (when applicable) • Access rights: closed access, embargoed access, restricted access,\nopen access. Additionally, we will closely monitor MIBBI (Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations) for\nmetadata standards more specific to our data type. For specific datasets, additional metadata will be associated with the data\nfile as appropriate. Give details as needed for the project. Specific examples (adjust as required): - SOPs for biological data\ngeneration are kept on a dedicated KU Leuven shared drive. A central excel file is stored on that same drive, detailing for\nexamples: (1) sample ID; (2) SOP with which data generation was performed; (3) abnormalities or deviations from SOP in data\ngeneration; (4) experimental QC values (e.g. DNA concentrations); (5) location of the source sample in the freezer. - For\nbioinformatics processing, a data analysis log will be kept that details: (1) sequencing run ID; (2) the bioinformatics\nSOPs/scripts that were applied; (3) location of source files; (4) abnormalities or deviations. The final dataset will be\naccompanied by this information under the form of a README.txt document. This file will be located in the top level directory of\nthe dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used. This will allow the data\nto be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse\n5. Data storage and backup during the project\n5.1. Where will the data be stored?\nDigital files will be stored on KU Leuven servers, except for private data that will be stored on KU Leuven secure server (digital\nvault). Add information about other data types as required (adjust and add more as needed): - Tissue samples: Tissues will be\nstored locally in the laboratory. All human tissue samples will be registered with a Belgian biobank, in compliance with the\nBelgian law on human body material (dd 19-12- 2008). - Omics data: omics data generated during the project will either be\nstored on KU Leuven servers or on The Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC), initially in the staging area and later in the\narchive area. - Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both\nunder the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock (-80°C). All published vectors and the\nassociated sequences will be sent to the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will take care of vector storage and\nshipping upon request. - Cell lines: Newly created human cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid nitrogen\nstorage and will be deposited in the UZ Leuven-KU Leuven Biobank. Other human cell lines will be stored locally in liquid\nnitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory when actively used for experiments. Animal cell lines will be stored in liquid nitrogen\ncryostorage of the laboratory. - Bacterial and yeast strains will be stored in a -80°C freezer in the lab of xxx. Costs are covered\nby general lab expenses. - Blood, saliva and fecal samples of study participants will be stored in -80°C freezer facilities with\nrestricted access. - Psychosocial data gathered with the questionnaires will be kept on Qualtrics servers within KU Leuven\ncontaining sample ID and SOP with the data generation. We will work with unique identifiers that enable us to link both the\nbiological with the psychosocial and mental health data. The Qualtrics server meets both the criteria stipulated by the Privacy\nCommission and the ethical committee of the KU Leuven. - Raw as well as derived microbiome data will be stored on a secured\nRaes lab storage server hosted by VIB (PSB-Gent). - A batch of each EO or EO fraction will be stored in duplicate in two separate\nrefrigerators at KU Leuven​MCB lab under the best possible conditions, but small changes in the composition over time cannot\nbe excluded. - Genetically modified organisms: Mice / Zebrafishes / Xenopus will be maintained in facilities of the Laboratory\nAnimal Center of KU Leuven, which applies Standard Operation Procedures concerning housing, feeding, health monitoring to\nassure consistent care in accordance with European and national regulations and guidelines. All animals will be registered in\nthe Leuven Animal Information System (LAIS) database, along with corresponding genotyping information, ethical approval\ndocuments and animal provider receipts. Drosophila lines will be stored in a dedicated room and managed using a specific\ndatabase for storage of the corresponding information (including genotype, origin, number of vials and date of transfer,\ncrossing schemes) and vial tracking via unique QR codes. Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as\nfrozen samples in cryovials as appropriate. - Algorithms, scripts and softwares: All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software\ncode driving the project will be stored in a private online git repository from the GitHub account of the department\n(https://github.com/vibcbd). - Nucleic acid and protein sequences: All nucleic acid and protein sequences generated during the\nproject will be stored on KU Leuven servers. Upon publication, all sequences supporting a manuscript will be made publicly\navailable via repositories such as the GenBank database or the European Nucleotide Archive (nucleotide sequences from\nprimers / new genes / new genomes), NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (microarray data / RNA-seq data / CHIPseq data), the\nProtein Database (for protein sequences), the EBI European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) for personally identifiable\n(epi)genome and transcriptome sequences\n5.2. How will the data be backed up?\nKU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme: - data stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using\nsnapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are\nkept. - data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between\nSaturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept. - data stored on the digital vault is backed up using snapshot\ntechnology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. As standard, 10% of the\nrequested storage is reserved for backups using the following backup regime: an hourly backup (at 8 a.m., 12 p.m., 4 p.m. and\n8 p.m.), the last 6 of which are kept; a daily backup (every day) at midnight, the last 6 of which are kept; and a weekly backup\n(every week) at midnight between Saturday and Sunday, the last 2 of which are kept. - All omics data stored on the Flemish\nSupercomputer Centre (VSC) will be transferred on a weekly basis to the archive area which is backed up. Incremental backups\nare done daily from one 20 TB QNAP NAS to a second 20 TB QNAP NAS. - Microbiome data on VIB servers is secured by daily\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 4\nsnapshot backups, as well as weekly and monthly long-term backups on independent servers. The data storage servers have\ninternal redundancy (RAID) to avoid data loss. All data will be also duplicated on KU Leuven servers for long term perservation. -\nFor bacterial and yeast strains: A backup of selected strains will be stored in -80°C freezers in xxx in a more compressed form\n(96-well plates instead of cryotubes)\n5.3. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or\ninsufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes There is sufficient storage and back-up capacity on all KU Leuven servers: - the “L-drive” is an easily scalable system, built\nfrom General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster with NetApp eseries storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front-\nend. - the “J-drive” is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controlers with an Ontap 9.1P9 operating system\n5.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How will these costs be\ncovered?\nThe total estimated cost of data storage during the project is 5000€. This estimation is based on the following costs: -The costs\nof digital data storage are as follows: 173,78€/TB/Year for the “L-drive” and 519€/TB/Year for the “J-drive”. -Maintaining a\nmouse colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), excluding the costs of genotyping. When no experiment is\nplanned with a particular mouse strain, and in compliance with the 3R’s rule (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk), cryopreservation will\nthus be used to safeguard the strain, prevent genetic drift, loss of transgene and potential infections or breeding problems.\nCryopreservation of sperm/embryos costs about 500 to 700 euro per genotype, plus a minimal annual storage fee (25 euro per\nstrain for 250 to 500 embryos). Frozen specimen are kept in two separate liquid nitrogen tanks at two different sites on\ncampus. When necessary, the costs of revitalization from cryopreserved sperm/embryos are about 1,100/600 euro.\nElectricity costs for the -80° freezers present in the labs are included in general lab costs.Data storage and backup costs are\nincluded in general lab costs.\n5.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by\nunauthorized persons?\nBoth the “L-drive” and “J-drive” servers are accessible only by laboratory members, and are mirrored in the second ICTS\ndatacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. Access to\nthe digital vault is possible only through using a KU Leuven user-id and password, and user rights only grant access to the data\nin their own vault. Sensitive data transfer will be performed according to the best practices for “Copying data to the secure\nenvironment” defined by KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the\napplication of upgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound by\nthe ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. A security service monitors the technical installations\ncontinuously, even outside working hours. All private data will be rendered anonymous before processing outside the digital\nvault. Only the PI will be granted access to the server to deposit private data. The PI will be the only responsible for linking\npatient information, survey data and/or tissue samples, and will strictly respect confidentiality. All de-identified data will be\nexported from the database by the PI, and stored on KU Leuven servers from where it can be accessed by the research and\ntechnical staff from the laboratory.\n6. Data preservation after the end of the project\n6.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the project? If only a selection of\nthe data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is the case (legal or contractual restrictions, physical\npreservation issues, ...).\nThe minimum preservation term of 10 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets. All datasets will be stored\non the university's central servers with automatic back-up procedures for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.\nThe costs (€156 per TB per year for “Large volume-storage” ) will be covered by the PIs.\n6.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)?\nAs a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that support FAIR data\nsharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of publication. For all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured\nas follows: -Digital datasets: files will be stored on the “L-drive”. -Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory.\n-Omics data: datasets will be stored on the “L-drive” or, for larger datasets, on the Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum\n6.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How will the costs be covered?\nThe total estimated cost of data storage during 10 years after the end of the project is . This estimation is based on the\nfollowing costs: -The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 173,78€/TB/Year for the “L-drive” and 519€/TB/Year for the “J-\ndrive”.\n-Maintaining a mouse colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), excluding the costs of genotyping. When no\nexperiment is planned with a particular mouse strain, and in compliance with the 3R’s rule (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk),\ncryopreservation will thus be used to safeguard the strain, prevent genetic drift, loss of transgene and potential infections or\nbreeding problems. Cryopreservation of sperm/embryos costs about 500 to 700 euro per genotype, plus a minimal annual\nstorage fee (25 euro per strain for 250 to 500 embryos). Frozen specimen are kept in two separate liquid nitrogen tanks at two\ndifferent sites on campus. When necessary, the costs of revitalization from cryopreserved sperm/embryos are about 1,100/600\neuro. Data storage and backup costs are included in general lab costs\n7. Data sharing and re-use\n7.1. Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an\nagreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions or because of IP potential)?\nNo\n7.2. Which data will be made available after the end of the project?\nParticipants to the present project are committed to publish research results to communicate them to peers and to a wide\naudience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made openly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data\nmay be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new\ncollaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. negative data). We aim at communicating our results in top journals that require\nfull disclosure upon publication of all included data, either in the main text, in supplementary material or in a data repository if\nrequested by the journal and following deposit advice given by the journal. Depending on the journal, accessibility restrictions\nmay apply. Biological material will be distributed to other parties if requested\n7.3. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn a restricted access repository\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 4\nAfter contacting the PI.\n7.4. When will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nOnce the data are published they will be available for the broad audience by sharing the link to the dataset.\n7.5. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nWhenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories that support\nFAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse, and\nwill be conform to community norms. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative\nCommons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication, a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) or an ODC Public\nDomain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed\nto access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. For data\nshared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non​disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with\nthe beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted\n7.6. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nIt is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and\nfile storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to​use data repositories and dissemination facilities\nwhenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. A budget for publication costs has been\nrequested in this project\n8. Responsibilities\n8.1. Who will be responsible for the data documentation & metadata?\nMetadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful\nnotes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook) that refer to specific datasets.\n8.2. Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nThe research and technical staff will ensure data storage and back up, with support from Andrei Segal Stanciu for the electronic\nlaboratory notebook (ELN) and KU Leuven drives.\n8.3. Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and sharing?\nThe PI is responsible for data preservation and sharing, with support from the research and technical staff involved in the\nproject, fromAndrei Segal Stanciu for the electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) and KU Leuven drives.\n8.4. Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nThe PI is ultimately responsible for all data management during and after data collection, including implementing and updating\nthe DMP\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 4"

We will work with unique identifiers that enable us to link both the biological with the psychosocial and mental health data. The Qualtrics server meets both the criteria stipulated by the Privacy Commission and the ethical committee of the KU Leuven. - Raw as well as derived microbiome data will be stored on a secured Raes lab storage server hosted by VIB (PSB-Gent). - A batch of each EO or EO fraction will be stored in duplicate in two separate refrigerators at KU Leuven​MCB lab under the best possible conditions, but small changes in the composition over time cannot be excluded. - Genetically modified organisms: Mice / Zebrafishes / Xenopus will be maintained in facilities of the Laboratory Animal Center of KU Leuven, which applies Standard Operation Procedures concerning housing, feeding, health monitoring to assure consistent care in accordance with European and national regulations and guidelines. All animals will be registered in the Leuven Animal Information System (LAIS) database, along with corresponding genotyping information, ethical approval documents and animal provider receipts. Drosophila lines will be stored in a dedicated room and managed using a specific database for storage of the corresponding information (including genotype, origin, number of vials and date of transfer, crossing schemes) and vial tracking via unique QR codes. Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate. - Algorithms, scripts and softwares: All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software code driving the project will be stored in a private online git repository from the GitHub account of the department (https://github.com/vibcbd). - Nucleic acid and protein sequences: All nucleic acid and protein sequences generated during the project will be stored on KU Leuven servers. Upon publication, all sequences supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via repositories such as the GenBank database or the European Nucleotide Archive (nucleotide sequences from primers / new genes / new genomes), NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (microarray data / RNA-seq data / CHIPseq data), the Protein Database (for protein sequences), the EBI European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) for personally identifiable (epi)genome and transcriptome sequences 5.2. How will the data be backed up? KU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme: - data stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept. - data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept. - data stored on the digital vault is backed up using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. As standard, 10% of the requested storage is reserved for backups using the following backup regime: an hourly backup (at 8 a.m., 12 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.), the last 6 of which are kept; a daily backup (every day) at midnight, the last 6 of which are kept; and a weekly backup (every week) at midnight between Saturday and Sunday, the last 2 of which are kept. - All omics data stored on the Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC) will be transferred on a weekly basis to the archive area which is backed up. Incremental backups are done daily from one 20 TB QNAP NAS to a second 20 TB QNAP NAS. - Microbiome data on VIB servers is secured by daily This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 2 of 4 snapshot backups, as well as weekly and monthly long-term backups on independent servers. The data storage servers have internal redundancy (RAID) to avoid data loss. All data will be also duplicated on KU Leuven servers for long term perservation. - For bacterial and yeast strains: A backup of selected strains will be stored in -80°C freezers in xxx in a more compressed form (96-well plates instead of cryotubes) 5.3. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes There is sufficient storage and back-up capacity on all KU Leuven servers: - the “L-drive” is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster with NetApp eseries storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front- end. - the “J-drive” is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controlers with an Ontap 9.1P9 operating system 5.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How will these costs be covered? The total estimated cost of data storage during the project is 5000€. This estimation is based on the following costs: -The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 173,78€/TB/Year for the “L-drive” and 519€/TB/Year for the “J-drive”. -Maintaining a mouse colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), excluding the costs of genotyping. When no experiment is planned with a particular mouse strain, and in compliance with the 3R’s rule (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk), cryopreservation will thus be used to safeguard the strain, prevent genetic drift, loss of transgene and potential infections or breeding problems. Cryopreservation of sperm/embryos costs about 500 to 700 euro per genotype, plus a minimal annual storage fee (25 euro per strain for 250 to 500 embryos). Frozen specimen are kept in two separate liquid nitrogen tanks at two different sites on campus. When necessary, the costs of revitalization from cryopreserved sperm/embryos are about 1,100/600 euro. Electricity costs for the -80° freezers present in the labs are included in general lab costs.Data storage and backup costs are included in general lab costs. 5.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Both the “L-drive” and “J-drive” servers are accessible only by laboratory members, and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. Access to the digital vault is possible only through using a KU Leuven user-id and password, and user rights only grant access to the data in their own vault. Sensitive data transfer will be performed according to the best practices for “Copying data to the secure environment” defined by KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of upgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound by the ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. A security service monitors the technical installations continuously, even outside working hours. All private data will be rendered anonymous before processing outside the digital vault. Only the PI will be granted access to the server to deposit private data. The PI will be the only responsible for linking patient information, survey data and/or tissue samples, and will strictly respect confidentiality. All de-identified data will be exported from the database by the PI, and stored on KU Leuven servers from where it can be accessed by the research and technical staff from the laboratory. 6. Data preservation after the end of the project 6.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the project? If only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is the case (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...). The minimum preservation term of 10 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets. All datasets will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic back-up procedures for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. The costs (€156 per TB per year for “Large volume-storage” ) will be covered by the PIs. 6.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)? As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of publication. For all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows: -Digital datasets: files will be stored on the “L-drive”. -Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory. -Omics data: datasets will be stored on the “L-drive” or, for larger datasets, on the Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum 6.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How will the costs be covered? The total estimated cost of data storage during 10 years after the end of the project is . This estimation is based on the following costs: -The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 173,78€/TB/Year for the “L-drive” and 519€/TB/Year for the “J- drive”. -Maintaining a mouse colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), excluding the costs of genotyping.

Data storage and backup costs are included in general lab costs 7. Data sharing and re-use 7.1. Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions or because of IP potential)? No 7.2. Which data will be made available after the end of the project? Participants to the present project are committed to publish research results to communicate them to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made openly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new collaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. negative data). We aim at communicating our results in top journals that require full disclosure upon publication of all included data, either in the main text, in supplementary material or in a data repository if requested by the journal and following deposit advice given by the journal. Depending on the journal, accessibility restrictions may apply. Biological material will be distributed to other parties if requested 7.3. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? In a restricted access repository This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 3 of 4 After contacting the PI. 7.4. When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results Once the data are published they will be available for the broad audience by sharing the link to the dataset. 7.5. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse, and will be conform to community norms. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication, a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) or an ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non​disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted 7.6. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to​use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. A budget for publication costs has been requested in this project 8. Responsibilities 8.1. Who will be responsible for the data documentation & metadata? Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook) that refer to specific datasets. 8.2. Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project? The research and technical staff will ensure data storage and back up, with support from Andrei Segal Stanciu for the electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) and KU Leuven drives. 8.3. Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and sharing? The PI is responsible for data preservation and sharing, with support from the research and technical staff involved in the project, fromAndrei Segal Stanciu for the electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) and KU Leuven drives. 8.4. Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP? The PI is ultimately responsible for all data management during and after data collection, including implementing and updating the DMP This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 4 of 4"
