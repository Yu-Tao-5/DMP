LEGAL AND ETHICAL ISSUES\nWill you use personal data?  If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add the \nreference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for Research and Public Service  \nPurposes (PRET application).   Be aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is  \na legal obligation.\n●No\nPrivacy Registry Reference:  \nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used:  \nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on \nhumans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant \nethical review committee(s)\n●No\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? \nWill IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions \nwill be asserted? \n●Yes\nWe do not exclude that any data (primarily novel chemical compounds with favorable properties) will be \npatented. After patenting, data will be shared in regular scientific manuscripts and this would not pose any  \nrestrictions to data sharing.  \nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If \nso, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\n●No\n34. DOCUMENTATION AND METADATA\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this \nproject?\n1.Synthetic protocols will be described in detail in the lab journals with referral to LC-MS and NMR \ncharacterization data.  \n2. Gel and Western blot data: detailed protocols will be noted down in the lab journals with referral to the \ngel data with lab journal number and page. Settings of the acquisition settings will be recorded.  \n3. For imaging data, the following information will be noted: dimensions, image type, bit-depth, pixel sizes \nand microscope settings. The methodology and protocol will be described in detail in the lab journals. A \nReadMe file of the image collection will be written.  \nWill a metadata standard be used? If so,  describe in detail which standard will be used.  If no, \nstate in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse.\n●No\nEach data created in the project will be linked by name to a lab journal name (initials of the experimener), \nnotebook number and page number, so that it can be linked to specific experiments.  \n5. DATA STORAGE AND BACKUP DURING THE FWO PROJECT\nWhere will the data be stored?  \nHow is backup of the data provided?\nData will be stored on the university's central servers and mirrored in a second datacenter, as well as \nsyncing with a OneDrive (for each person involved)  \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will  \nbe taken care of.\n●Yes\n1. There will be 4 TB of storage capacity available (2x2) at OneDrive for the two people involved in the \nproject. \n2. There is currently 5 TB storage capacity available as long term external hard drive capacity. This will be  \nexpanded as needed. Extra back up at KU Leuven long term storage will be arranged during the course \nof this project. \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these \ncosts be covered? \nExpected costs for long term storage are 504.30 EUR per 5 TB/year. These costs will be paid from \nconsumable costs of this project, and - once the project ends, by a other funds from the laboratory.  \n4Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified \nby unauthorized persons?\nData will be password protected and encrypted (OneDrive) and secured for access by a limited amount of  \nusers (large data storage)  \n6.

In case \nonly a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or \ncontractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll data will be kept for at least 5 years, and all relevant research data (data related to PhD theses, \npublications and data still relevant for future publications) will be kept for a period of minimally 10 years \naccording to KU Leuven research data management policy.  \nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\n1. The data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for at \nleast 10 years, conform the KU Leuven research data management policy  \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will  \nthe costs be covered?  \n1. The expected amount of data will be approximately 2TB or less. The estimated costs for storate are \n202 EUR/year and will be covered by laboratory funds.  \n7. DATA SHARING AND REUSE\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in \nan agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\n●No\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\n1. All data will be available upon request. Where appropriate, public data repositories will be used (e.g. \nProteomeXchange for proteomics data, if generated).  \nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\n●Other (specify):\nAll data will be available upon request.  Where appropriate, public data repositories will be used (e.g. \nProteomeXchange for proteomics data, if generated).  \nWhen will the data be made available?\n●Upon publication of the research results\n5Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nFull datasets will be available to anyone for scientific purposes, provided that they give appropriate credit \nto the creators. \nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?  \nNo expected costs for data sharing.  \n8. RESPONSIBILITIES\nWho will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?\nThe two researchers involved in the project as well as the PI will be responsible for data documentation \nand metadata \nWho will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nThe two researchers involved in the project as well as the PI will be responsible for data documentation \nand metadata \nWho will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ?\nThe PI will be responsible for data preservation and reuse.  \nWho bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nThe PI bears the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP.
