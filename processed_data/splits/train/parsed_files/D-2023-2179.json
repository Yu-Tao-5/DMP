The F WO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official  start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO \nbut to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel.  Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.  \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation  Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives  of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions.  This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning .

Almost all of our waking lives are spent in close company of others. \nEmotions, thoughts and physiological processes (e.g. heart rate, arousal) can therefore be easily transmitted \nfrom one individual to another, eithe r by conscious verbal communication, or by unconscious and still poorly \nunderstood bodily signals (i.e. biobehavioral synchrony). Paradoxically, however, socio -affective \nneuroscience approaches typically examine individual humans in isolation, presenting s ocial signals on a \ncomputer screen or via headphones. Yet, this is fundamentally not how social interaction works, as social \ninteraction is intrinsically dynamic and interactive. In the current project, we will compare the biobehavioral \nattunement of 8-to-12-year -old children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), who are characterized by \nsevere difficulties in communication and interaction, with that of matched typically developing controls, \nusing dual multimodal biobehavioral measurements throughout a serie s of innovative real -life dyadic \ninteraction paradigms.  \n \nProject 3M220376, funded with 12C9723N,  additionally  focusses on the unique effect of a single -session \ninterpersonal sensorimotor synchronization therapy on bio behavioral synchrony measures  in ASD . \n \nProject 3M220478, funded with G023923N, additionally  focusses on the added, synerg etic effect of a single -\nsession interpersonal sensorimotor synchronization therapy combined with a single dose intranasal oxytocin \nadministration on biobehavioral s ynchrony measures  in ASD . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   4 \n 2.

As such, a separate folder will be created and encrypted for  the current  dataset. Only the PI \nand registered collaborating researchers will have access to this folder via the encryption key.  \nThe KU Leuven network drives (e.g. L-drive)  are incorporated within secured KU Leuven environments, are \npassword -protected (including  smartphone -based multi -factor identification) and are only accessible by \nregistered collaborating researchers. Only the PI can request access to the ne twork drive for study  \npersonnel.  \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?  The OneDrive (2TB) comes free of  charge  for student s and personnel of KU Leuven.  \nThe Department of Neurosciences  provides our research group ( Center for Developmental Psychiatry ) with \nan L-drive. As such, costs will be covered by the department . \n \nAny additional costs regarding storage and backup  will be co vered by project -related  funding ( 12C9723N \nand G023923N).  \n \n \n5. Data Preservation  after the end of the Research P roject  \n \nWhich data will be retained for at least five \nyears (or longer, in agreement with other \nretention policies that are applicable) after the \nend of the  project? In case some data cannot be \npreserved , clearly state the reasons for this  \n(e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). All digitally generated data , as well as all bi ological material,  will be archived for minimally 10 years after \nstudy completion, in line with the KU Leuven RDM policy.  This ensures the possibility of reuse  of these \ncollected data  within our own  lab.  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   13 \n Where will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long -term)?  These  data will be stored at a restricted area of the K: archive drive, which can only be accessed by the \ninvolved researchers and the unit’s data manager. All drives are managed by KU Leuven personnel, bound \nby the KU Leuven general and ICT codes of conduct.  \n \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during the expected retention \nperiod? How will these costs be covered?  \n \n \n The yearly cost for network share storage on the K -drive is € 11.384 euro per 100 Gb. The Group Biomedical \nSciences sponsors 50% of this cost price. So the price paid by the lab will be : €5 .69. \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   14 \n 6.

The F WO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning .

Almost all of our waking lives are spent in close company of others. Emotions, thoughts and physiological processes (e.g. heart rate, arousal) can therefore be easily transmitted from one individual to another, eithe r by conscious verbal communication, or by unconscious and still poorly understood bodily signals (i.e. biobehavioral synchrony). Paradoxically, however, socio -affective neuroscience approaches typically examine individual humans in isolation, presenting s ocial signals on a computer screen or via headphones. Yet, this is fundamentally not how social interaction works, as social interaction is intrinsically dynamic and interactive. In the current project, we will compare the biobehavioral attunement of 8-to-12-year -old children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), who are characterized by severe difficulties in communication and interaction, with that of matched typically developing controls, using dual multimodal biobehavioral measurements throughout a serie s of innovative real -life dyadic interaction paradigms. Project 3M220376, funded with 12C9723N, additionally focusses on the unique effect of a single -session interpersonal sensorimotor synchronization therapy on bio behavioral synchrony measures in ASD . Project 3M220478, funded with G023923N, additionally focusses on the added, synerg etic effect of a single - session interpersonal sensorimotor synchronization therapy combined with a single dose intranasal oxytocin administration on biobehavioral s ynchrony measures in ASD .

Regarding data sharing repositories, metadata will be provided according to guidelines provided by the respective platforms. 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? All data collected throughout the project is documented via a secure web -based application (Research Electronic Data Capture, REDCap), running on the protected servers of the University Hospital. Data will be transferred to the researcher’s OneDrive, linked to their KU Leuven account, for data analysis. The promotor will be given access to these files, to ensure data access at all times. Upon finalizing data processing, data will be stored on BIOMED K-Drive (secure KU Leuven facility for archiving) for at least 10 years (crf. Infra ). Paper data will be stored i n the office of the primary researcher , at KU Leuven, in a locked drawer or cupboard that can only be accessed by the researcher.

CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 6 The personal nature of OneDrive ensures that files that are not explicitly share d, are not accessible to anyone else. As such, a separate folder will be created and encrypted for the current dataset. Only the PI and registered collaborating researchers will have access to this folder via the encryption key. The KU Leuven network drives (e.g. L-drive) are incorporated within secured KU Leuven environments, are password -protected (including smartphone -based multi -factor identification) and are only accessible by registered collaborating researchers. Only the PI can request access to the ne twork drive for study personnel. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The OneDrive (2TB) comes free of charge for student s and personnel of KU Leuven. The Department of Neurosciences provides our research group ( Center for Developmental Psychiatry ) with an L-drive. As such, costs will be covered by the department . Any additional costs regarding storage and backup will be co vered by project -related funding ( 12C9723N and G023923N). 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). All digitally generated data , as well as all bi ological material, will be archived for minimally 10 years after study completion, in line with the KU Leuven RDM policy. This ensures the possibility of reuse of these collected data within our own lab. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13 Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? These data will be stored at a restricted area of the K: archive drive, which can only be accessed by the involved researchers and the unit’s data manager. All drives are managed by KU Leuven personnel, bound by the KU Leuven general and ICT codes of conduct. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The yearly cost for network share storage on the K -drive is € 11.384 euro per 100 Gb. The Group Biomedical Sciences sponsors 50% of this cost price. So the price paid by the lab will be : €5 .69. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available.
