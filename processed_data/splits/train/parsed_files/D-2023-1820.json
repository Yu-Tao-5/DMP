The FWO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months a\u0000er the oﬃcial start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submi\u0000ed to FWO but to the research co-ordina\u0000on oﬃce of the host ins\u0000tute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the ﬁnal version of the DMP has to be added to the ﬁnal report of the project; this should be submi\u0000ed to FWO by the supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its ﬁrst version. The DMP is an element in the ﬁnal evalua\u0000on of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submi\u0000ed within the ﬁrst 6 months a\u0000er the start date and the ﬁnal DMP may use this template.The DMP template used by the Research Founda\u0000on Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representa\u0000ves of all Flemish funders and research ins\u0000tu\u0000ons. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate comple\u0000on of the DMP, a standardized glossary of deﬁni\u0000ons and abbrevia\u0000ons is available via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)1\nName Grant Holder & ORCIDDaniel Bath; 0000-0003-3062-3957Contributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & rolesNero Budur (0000-0002-0181-9988): supervisorProject number & \u0000tle 12E9623N, Singulari\u0000es around Hyperplane ArrangementsFunder(s) GrantIDFWOAﬃlia\u0000on(s)☐ KU Leuven ☐ Universiteit Antwerpen☐ Universiteit Gent ☐ Universiteit Hasselt☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel ☐ Other:Provide ROR iden\u0000ﬁer when possible: Please provide a short project descrip\u0000onThe project is devoted to studying the singularities of hyperplane arrangements with special regard to the local systems on an arrangement's complement. There are three main focuses: resolving strong monodromy conjecture for hyperplane arrangements; giving a D-module interpretation of the resonance varieties of an arrangement; proving Terao's conjecture \"hyperplane arrangements satisfy the logarithmic comparision theorem\" as well as establishing a suitable twisted version. The first objective depends on solving a conjecture of Budur, Mustata, and Teitler; the second on developing notions from algebraic statistics (e.g. the critical set); the third on building of old work of Calderon-Moreno, Castro-Jimenez, Mond, Narvaez-Macarro which answers the question in a very special case.General Project Informa\u0000on1. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)2\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

Again: as the data is of the content of produced or being produced manuscripts, modiﬁca\u0000on by bad actors is not expected.What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?I expect essen\u0000ally zero addi\u0000onal costs.5. Data Preserva\u0000on a\u0000er the end of the Research ProjectFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)7 Which data will be retained for at least ﬁve years (or longer, in agreement with other reten\u0000on policies that are applicable) a\u0000er the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restric\u0000ons, storage/budget issues, ins\u0000tu\u0000onal policies...).All data will be retained for at least ﬁve years a\u0000er the end of the project. hillhdbhid(ddhiiillbd(ll)hiiihblihd Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?The preprint manuscripts will be stored (freely, openly) on the arXiv in perpetuity. The published manuscripts will be given to the journal of publica\u0000on for them to store in whatever way they deem ﬁt.What are the expected costs for data preserva\u0000on during the expected reten\u0000on period? How will these costs be covered?Essen\u0000ally zero costs are expected. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)8 6. Data Sharing and ReuseWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse a\u0000er/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY.

Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects☐ Yes, intellectual property rights☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use☐ Yes, other☐ NoIf yes, please specify: While preprints will be freely and openly accessible, access to published manuscripts will depend on an individual/ins\u0000tu\u0000ons subscrip\u0000on to the journal. Preprints will remain available for access in perpetuity however.Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per The data in preprint form will be made available on arxiv.org.

If none, please explain why.A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT.EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” I will select journals that use one of, or something roughly equivalent to one of the following data license: Crea\u0000ve Commons A\u0000ribu\u0000on-Noncommercial License (CC BY-NC), Crea\u0000ve Commons A\u0000ribu\u0000on-No Deriva\u0000ves License (CC BY-ND) or the Crea\u0000ve Commons A\u0000ribu\u0000on License. Such licenses for published mathema\u0000cs ar\u0000cles is the norm.For preprints I will use arXiv's \"perpetual, non-exclusive license.\"Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here.INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes☐ NoIf yes: a DOI will be added to each published ar\u0000cle by the publisher.What are the expected costs for data sharing?
