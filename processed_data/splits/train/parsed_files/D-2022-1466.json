The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but\nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of co urse have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\n1.General Information\nName applicant Tjonnie Guang Feng Li\nFWO Project Number & Title Curving Spacetime Curvature: Hunting for Gravitational Lensing of Gravitational Waves\nAffiliation X KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent\n☐ Universiteit Hasselt \n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel\n☐ Other: \n2.Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make\nuse of existing data?
