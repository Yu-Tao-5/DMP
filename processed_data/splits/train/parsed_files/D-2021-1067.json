In\nmijn onderzoek analyseer ik in welke mate religie als autonome en unieke categorie en\nonafhankelijk onderzoeksveld werd gelegitimeerd door een \"racialized project of distinction.\" Dit\nconcept duidt zowel op de constante neiging tot het maken van fundamenteel onderscheid als op\nde scheidslijnen zelf. Mijn hypothese luidt: 1) vooraanstaande theorien over religie waren vaak\ngestoeld op fundamenteel onderscheid: heilig/profaan, religieus/seculier,\nprimitief/geciviliseerd;en 2) deze (behoefte aan) scheidslijnen werden gevormd en versterkt door\nde ontwikkeling van raciale categorieen en hierarchien en droegen hieraan bij (dwz \"racialized\").\nMijn onderzoek is vernieuwend omdat het centrale teksten in de religiewetenschap (zoals die van\nTylor, Muller, Frazer en Eliade) bestudeert vanuit het oogpunt van filosofische werken in \"black\nstudies.\" Ik breng zo twee onderzoeksvelden bij elkaar die vaak gescheiden zijn. Het onderzoek\nis actueel en urgent omdat het bestuderen van de relatie tussen ras en religie bijdraagt aan het\ndekoloniseren van het begrip religie en het bestuderen daarvan; zowel in de wetenschap als in\nhet publieke domein. Door te onderzoeken op welke, vaak subtiele, manier ideeen over ras een\nrol hebben gespeeld in de begripsvorming van religie, draagt mijn werk ook bij aan de kennis\nover hoe en waarom ras en \"religie\" tot op heden een belangrijke rol spelen in het leven in\nEuropa.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. General Information\nName applicant\nJustine M. Bakker\nFWO Project Number & Title\n12R8122N: “Race and the Project of Distinction in the Study of Religion”\nPlease note that, due to an appointment as Assistant Professor in Comparative\nReligious Studies, I have reduced my “mandaat” with 50%. This means that I will not\nbe able to execute all objectives stated in the original proposal.\nAffiliation\nKU Leuven\n2. Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nReuse existing data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\n \nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 4\n Type of\ndata\nFormat \n Volume\nOrigin? \nBooks and\narticles\nPDF and print\nMax 1GB\nPublished works, publicly\naccessible\nArchival\nMaterials\nScans;\norganized in\nand trough\nTropy.\nMax 10GB\n“Eliade papers at the University\nChicago”\nMy own\nnotes,\nannotations,\nand research\njournals\n(paper and\non computer)\nWord;\nEvernote; in\nBooks/Articles\nMax 1GB\n \nBiographical\nInformation\nabout\nsources\nZotero; excel\nMax 1GB\n \nPodcast\nEpisodes\nMP3; PDF\n(consent\nforms)\nMax 1GB\nEach episode is based on recorded\nconversations that I will have with\nselect participants of the academic\n“race and religion” workshop (4-\n8 episodes). To be clear: these\nconversations are not research\ndata, but rather dialogues with\nfellow scholars, conducted with the\nexplicit purpose of sharing\nacademic insights with a wide(r)\naudience. If desired, future\nresearchers can use these\ninterviews for their own research\nproject. I will secure written\npermission from each participant\nbefore I will make the podcast\nepisodes available to the public.\nI have submitted a PRET review\napplication with KU Leuven (G-\n2022-5231).\n \n3. Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse.

As noted in my answer to the previous question, I will record a series of\ninterviews with scholars in religious studies about their research and publish these, as podcast\nepisodes, after obtaining formal consent. After conslutation with Nele Noppe, I submitted a PRET\nreview to determine whether or not these interviews indeed consist of/include \"personal data\".\n \nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)?

If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nThe Eliade papers do not restrict access or citations; I will have to determine, once\nI’ve visited the archive, whether I can obtain permission to published the archival\nmaterial that I will use online.\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nAll archival material will be clearly labeled and organized; notes will be labeled and\norganized, and stored in RDR (I will include a “readme” file which will help future\nreaders understand my process and notes).\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nYes\nI will likely use the Dublin Core metadata standard to systematize the archival data in\nTropy.\n5.
