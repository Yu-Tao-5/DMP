A key challenge remains the development of mass manufacturable interface chemistries that allow for\nstable, reliable, and reproducible immobilization of the bioreceptors onto the sensor substrate. Atmospheric pressure plasma deposition\n(AP-PD) of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) based polymers could offer a low-cost and environmentally friendly solution due to their excellent\nbiocompatibility and antifouling properties. However, conventional AP-PD processes are not compatible with biomolecules due to the\nharsh direct plasma conditions. Aerosol-assisted AP-PD with an afterglow plasma could limit the degradation but a lack of fundamental\ninsight hampers the development of PEO-based polymers with optimal properties. We therefore propose an investigation of the\ndeposition mechanism and how precursor, co-reagent and AP-PD conditions affect the composition, morphology, and properties of PEO-\nbased polymers. The physical aspects of the process will be investigated with a computational fluid dynamic model to complement\nexperiments. These insights will be used to design AP-PD co-deposition processes that enable the construction of an amperometric\nbiosensor by entrapment of enzymes and redox mediators in PEO layers, hereby demonstrating the potential of AP-PD as an innovative\none-step functionalization method.\nLast modified: \n25-04-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Last modiﬁed 25 April 2023\n3 of 6\nTo be determined later in agreement with MPG, as the results might contain sensitive information for MPG.\n2. Documentation and Metadata\nClearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in\nthe future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is\nrecorded).\nAll samples have a unique identiefier consisting of the date + #sample of the day.\nData reflects date on which the deposition experiment was performed. All characterization performed on the samples will use the same sample identifier. All data from 1 specific experiment will be\ngrouped in 1 folder, also containing an excel describing the experimental conditions for every sample.\nMetadata will be provided in order to increase the potential for re-use. An adapted Dublin Core Metadata standard will be used and consists of the following metadata elements:\nData ID, title, subject, name, creator, owner, related project ID, project summary, data abstract, keywords, type, size, format, source (e.g. ID of measurement device), language, related\npublications or patents, compliance, security and confidentiality aspects, rights\nThe following metadata elements will be added in case the data relates to the results of experiments:\nExperimental set-up, study design, sampling methodology, variable-level detail, reference to specific model, and all other information necessary for a secondary analyst to use the data\naccurately and effectively.\nTabular data will contain SI units, these international Standard Scientific Units of Measurement will be used to denote values.\nA folder and filing hierarchy will be set out and documented, schematically represented in Figure 1. Furthermore, an organisational standard workbook file will be used as temporary “data catalog”\nduring the project execution phase, where at the end of the project, easy overview of the created data as well as its potential value for reuse can be easily identified. At the end of the project, the\ndata will be reviewed on reusability, and will be added to the institutional data catalog tool or data catalog excel in the main folder.\nFolder set-up and naming will be used to deliver and communicate minimum necessary metadata.\nFolders will be used to collect metadata with the data, in case the data files cannot be annotated. In this case, a Readme file will be added, in .xls/xlsx format. Where possible, the\nmetadata will be added directly to the data.\nFolder structure and naming will be set up according to the structure of the PROJECT/CONSORTIUM, as set out in the project description, by WORK PACKAGES->TASKS-\n>EXPERIMENT->DELIVERABLE, schematically represented in Figure 1.\nFile naming conventions will be used to convey minimum necessary metadata as well.\nProjectName_SourceInstitution_WorkPackage_DeliverableTitle_DataOfOriginYYYYMMDD_Version\nThe file names together with the dates of creation allow quick reference to the labnotebook and project description, where the specific experiment(s) are described with more detailed\nparameters (time, consignee, protocol, samples names, conditions, ...).\nAll report files will include the document version history, containing version, activity, date and responsible, as added to this document above.\nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be\nused. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.\nYes\nAt least the imec metadata standard will be used (see metadata information in the above answer). The following metadata will be kept at minimum, for which a data content catalog will be\nkept during the project.\nData ID, name, creator, owner, related project ID, project summary, data abstract, keywords, type, size, format, source (e.g. ID of measurement device), experimental set-up, related\npublications or patents, compliance, security and confidentiality aspects.\n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nImec Data will be stored on the IMEC SharePoint (teams workspaces), or in specific cases on premise (Isilon). Data may be temporarily stored on researchers' computers or OneDrive’s while\nprocessing the data. Storing sensitive/confidential (project) information on removable devices such as an external hard disk is not allowed by the imec acceptable use policy because it increases\nthe risk of data loss (either through theft/loss of the disk or in case it breaks down).\nHow will the data be backed up?\nDuring the project: data on SharePoint will benefit from the following security services:\nAutomatic back-up\nThis is managed by Microsoft: The imec sharepoint is hosted on the Microsoft Cloud, which is a high available environment. Information on this environment is never automatically\ndeleted, removal of specific information should be managed by the business.\nIf information is removed from this environment, it is moved to a \"Recycle Bin\". From this Recycle Bin it can still be restored by the user for a period of 93 days (or an admin in case\nthe Recycle Bin was emptied).\nAfter these 93 days, items are deleted, and Microsoft will keep a backup for 14 additional days. During this period restoration can still be requested through a Microsoft ticket.\nAfter these 14 additional days, the data is permanently removed.\nOther data on premises (Isilon) have a automatic back-up system. Data is backed up via snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nOffice-type documents, smaller amounts of data (< 10 GB), targeted at humans?\nYes -> imec Teams/SharePoint\nNo -> Will the data be written or accessed by a machine without human login, or will the data be accessed outside of imec's internal network, or by external people?\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 25 April 2023\n4 of 6\nYes -> Azure data lake store\nNo -> Isilon (on-prem file servers)\n \nimec Teams (SharePoint):\nOnly to be used for smaller amounts of files (<10 Gb). Adding more data to a SharePoint is possible, but it is very costly for imec, and SharePoint will start performing badly.\nAzure data lake store: used to store larger amount of data, like \"binary\" data, \"log\" data, \"measurement\" data, ...\nFor larger amounts of files (the capacity is virtually unlimited)\nStorage exists in many cost-ranges from normally priced cloud storage to very cheap archive storage for data that probably will not be used again.\nIsilon (on-prem file servers): Internal on-prem file shares to store larger amounts of data.\nFor larger amounts of files (but the total space is limited by the hardware that is available at imec, so there is a limit to what is possible)\nMainly for data that is actively used, because this storage it too expensive to use as archive storage.\n \nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nDuring the project: as stated, data on SharePoint will benefit from the following security services:\nUser-authentication, multifactor authentication can be activated\nAll logins to imec environments are protected by a strong password (minimal 14 characters) combined with multi factor authentication.\nVersioning system\nVersioning is enabled by default on our SharePoint/Teams' environment. This can be modified by workspace owner and is under full responsibility by the business user\nSystem-encryption\nThis is managed by Microsoft as outlined in this article: Cloud data security measures in SharePoint & OneDrive - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Docs\nMaking sure that data is shared with the right people is the responsibility by the business user.\nConfidential data will be user encrypted in addition to this:\nWhen creating documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx), the user is forced to assign an information classification label to the document (Public / Restricted / Confidential / Strictly\nConfidential) based on the sensitivity of the information.\nWhile this label provides a (visual) marker on the sensitivity level of the information, it will not encrypt the document by default.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nStorage is available at imec at no added cost to the project. In general can be calculated with 50€ per month for 1terrabyte of data. However, this will not be being charged internally and is\nincluded in overhead expenses.\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be\npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\nAll data\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nAfter the standard retention period of 5 years, data will be subjected to evaluation. This will include weighing the potential value versus the costs of keeping it available. Decisions will\nbe made by the data owners, in close collaboration with ICT service responsibles for archiving.\n \n \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nIn general can be calculated with 50€ per month for 1terrabyte of data. However, this will not be being charged internally and is included in imec overhead expenses.\n \n \n \n5. Data sharing and reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made\navailable.\nYes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …)\nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.\no          We do not exclude that the proposed work could result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorization.\no          It is expected to obtain data that can potentially be valorised in all workpackages. The data will be kept confidential until 1) a decision will have been made on patenting, and 2) a patent file\nor publication has been submitted.\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 25 April 2023\n5 of 6\nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment\nsection per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nYes, Intellectual Property Rights\nAll data\nWhere will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.\nZenodo.org will be the preferred standard repository for open data, because this platform, part of the OpenAIRE collaboration, provides the minimum and recommended terms required by\nDataCite's Metadata Schema, including the assignment of an identifier. These services are furthermore free of charge and will be for the foreseeable future.\n \nSoftware code will be placed in GitHub.com in an open accessible manner to the public.\n \nPhysical data and samples will only be stored until the intended analyses are finished and all information is gathered.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of research results\nWhich data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why.\nCC-BY-SA: By Attribution, with a Share-Alike clause which means that anyone sharing or modifying the original work must release it under the same license. The material can be freely\nshared, redistributed, transformed, built upon and adapted for any purpose, including commercial use. Anyone using the material must provide credit to the original authors and indicate\nclearly any changes that were made. Anyone sharing the work or a derivative of it must do under the same license terms as it was originally shared.\nDo you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section.\nYes\nIn case of the open publication of data, a PID or DOI will be provided. E.g. Zenodo (repository) creates a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for each upload.\nIn case of restricted data that won’t be published open, an accession number will be provided by the imec-specific metadata management framework (data catalog).\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nThese costs will be covered in project overhead, except in case of circumstances that can be considered out of the ordinary.\n6.

For larger amounts of files (but the total space is limited by the hardware that is available at imec, so there is a limit to what is possible) Mainly for data that is actively used, because this storage it too expensive to use as archive storage. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? During the project: as stated, data on SharePoint will benefit from the following security services: User-authentication, multifactor authentication can be activated All logins to imec environments are protected by a strong password (minimal 14 characters) combined with multi factor authentication. Versioning system Versioning is enabled by default on our SharePoint/Teams' environment. This can be modified by workspace owner and is under full responsibility by the business user System-encryption This is managed by Microsoft as outlined in this article: Cloud data security measures in SharePoint & OneDrive - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Docs Making sure that data is shared with the right people is the responsibility by the business user. Confidential data will be user encrypted in addition to this: When creating documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx), the user is forced to assign an information classification label to the document (Public / Restricted / Confidential / Strictly Confidential) based on the sensitivity of the information. While this label provides a (visual) marker on the sensitivity level of the information, it will not encrypt the document by default. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Storage is available at imec at no added cost to the project. In general can be calculated with 50€ per month for 1terrabyte of data. However, this will not be being charged internally and is included in overhead expenses. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). All data Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? After the standard retention period of 5 years, data will be subjected to evaluation. This will include weighing the potential value versus the costs of keeping it available. Decisions will be made by the data owners, in close collaboration with ICT service responsibles for archiving. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? In general can be calculated with 50€ per month for 1terrabyte of data. However, this will not be being charged internally and is included in imec overhead expenses. 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. o We do not exclude that the proposed work could result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorization. o It is expected to obtain data that can potentially be valorised in all workpackages. The data will be kept confidential until 1) a decision will have been made on patenting, and 2) a patent file or publication has been submitted. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 25 April 2023 5 of 6 Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes, Intellectual Property Rights All data Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. Zenodo.org will be the preferred standard repository for open data, because this platform, part of the OpenAIRE collaboration, provides the minimum and recommended terms required by DataCite's Metadata Schema, including the assignment of an identifier. These services are furthermore free of charge and will be for the foreseeable future. Software code will be placed in GitHub.com in an open accessible manner to the public. Physical data and samples will only be stored until the intended analyses are finished and all information is gathered. When will the data be made available? Upon publication of research results Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. CC-BY-SA: By Attribution, with a Share-Alike clause which means that anyone sharing or modifying the original work must release it under the same license. The material can be freely shared, redistributed, transformed, built upon and adapted for any purpose, including commercial use. Anyone using the material must provide credit to the original authors and indicate clearly any changes that were made. Anyone sharing the work or a derivative of it must do under the same license terms as it was originally shared. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. Yes In case of the open publication of data, a PID or DOI will be provided. E.g. Zenodo (repository) creates a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for each upload. In case of restricted data that won’t be published open, an accession number will be provided by the imec-specific metadata management framework (data catalog). What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? These costs will be covered in project overhead, except in case of circumstances that can be considered out of the ordinary. 6.
