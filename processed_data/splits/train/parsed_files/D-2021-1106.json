Although essential for the\nglobal trade, port areas are considered among the most vulnerable and risky in the world. Here\naccidents frequently happen, human lives are lost and ships and goods are damaged. Among the\nmeteorological and climatological events, the wind is the most destructive natural phenomenon\nand most frequently the prime cause of accidents in coastal areas. Despite the important\nmilestones achieved in the past decades by the Wind Engineering research community to\ncharacterize the atmospheric winds over flat terrain for structural designing, it is still unclear how\nthe wind behaves in more complex and hybrid areas (as seaport areas) composed of open areas\nsurrounded by built-up environments. This is the main topic of the present project. The project\naims at providing the scientific community and the port stakeholders with a novel\nmultidisciplinary approach able to predict atmospheric wind flows over seaport areas in order to\nbetter estimate wind loads acting on ships and cranes. The research project will also provide a\ncomprehensive overview about the strengths and weaknesses of numerical and experimental\ntechniques when dealing with this kind of applications.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
