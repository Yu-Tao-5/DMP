The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Tim Debroyer - 0000-0003-2556-8674\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Kaat Wils – 0000-0002-9828-3760 – Full professor at KU Leuven, Faculty of Arts\nJoris Vandendriessche - 0000-0002-6304-8437- Tenure-track assistant professor, KU Leuven, Faculty of \nArts \nProject number 1 & title 3H230624 - Beyond self-help: Patient organisations, health activism and representations of disease in \nBelgium since 1940\nFunder(s) GrantID 211P8C24N\nAffiliation(s) X KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

These new organisations assumed more extensive medical and social  \nroles beyond self-help within communities of patients than is often acknowledged. This project enlarges the  \nscope by taking into account the broader functions such organisations fulfilled in acting against healthcare  \nand government, but also in influencing wider society. As such, it questions if patient organisations could be  \nconsidered 'forgotten architects' of the modern welfare state. Belgium thereby constitutes a promising case  \ndue to the historically close collaboration between patients and physicians, but also due to the striking  \ndifference in the evolution of patient organisations in the two parts of the country. The project scrutinises  \npatient organisations for the first time by using a combination of oral history and a qualitative analysis of  \narchival and published sources. It thereby looks into the history of Belgian organisations for diabetes,  \nmultiple sclerosis, breast cancer, Crohn’s disease and AIDS from the onset of the welfare state in the 1940s.  \nAs such, the project contributes to the historiography of medicine and health, but also offers a historical  \nperspective on the current topic of patient organisation and participation.  \n2.Research Data Summary\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 4List and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

Information in the Zotero database should provide enough information for future use but the content and structure of the dataset will be explained in a README file. -Sources: Archives, periodicals, newspapers, publications : Archival information is sorted per theme/disease and if applicable per organisation on a lower level. Information on the collecting and processing of these materials will be gathered. Still to be determined which materials can be shared for future research and how these could be provided with documentation. The content and structure of these sources will be explained in a README file. -Sources: Interviews with patients, members of patient organisations and physicians : Interviews are sorted per organisation and witness on a lower level. If interviewees consent, future researchers will be able to consult interviews at KADOC. All metadata on the person interviewed, the interview and informed consent will be gathered in a report together with the transcription. The content and structure of these sources will be explained in a README file. -Notes: Annotations about literature and sources : Sorted per theme/disease and on a lower level chronologically. The content and structure of these notes will be explained in a README file. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: See previous question FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 94.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored?

WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? ☒ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back-ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes According to the current prognosis, the current 2TB limit on my KU Leuven Faculty of Arts OneDrive will be sufficient. If that is not the case, I will request a free extension to 5TB in time. ☐ No If no, please specify: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data Data will only be accessed via my KU Leuven laptop which is secured via Bitlocker. All data will be backed- up by using the secured KU Leuven OneDrive. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Apart from the purchase of a laptop secured by the ICT service of the Faculty of Arts, the data storage and back-up facilities of the Faculty of Arts are free of charge. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Over the course of the project, I will explore the possibilities of different large-volume storage options like a SharePoint online-site and a Teams site which are free of charge, or a SharePoint on premise-site (with a considerable cost). I will thereby look for a storage option which offers sufficient capacity, access options, but also confidentiality guarantees. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY.
