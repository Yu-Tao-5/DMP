The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Pierre Vanderhaeghen -  \n0000-0001-7899-5720)\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Andre Fische DZNE, Guiseppe Testa Genopole Milano, Angel Barco Inst neuroscience Spain, Shlomo \nWagner Israel\nProject number 1 & title  Patient-centered Targeting of Epigenetic Vulnerabilities in Neurodevelopmental Disorders: A Cross-\ndisciplinary Platform for Druggable Disease Models\nFunder(s) GrantID 2G0G6321N\nAffiliation(s) x KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\nPlease provide a short project description\nIntellectual disability disorders (IDDs) affect young children and summarize a group of developmental disorders\nthat are associated with impaired memory function and other abnormalities. While it is known that genetics\nplay a key role in pathogenesis of these diseases, no therapeutic strategies exist yet. Many of the known\nmutations affect proteins that act as key regulators of epigenetic gene-expression and one pathway stands\nout, namely processes that control the methylation of histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me). It is therefore possible\nthat therapeutic strategies to target H3K4-related processes might be a suitable therapeutic avenue for various\nIDDs. This has not been systematically tested so far. In our project we will study in a comparative manner\ndifferent IDD models with the aim to find common and specific molecular alterations linked to the disease\nsymptoms. This will allow us to establish a pipeline for drug testing.  \n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number. This question is optional.

Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): Vectors: will be deposited in public repositories such as Addgene. Protein or nucleic acid sequences: will be deposited in GenBank and/or published as supplemental data files as appropriate. Intermediate analysis files will also be kept on KU Leuven servers for 5 years. Proteomics data: will be deposited in public repositories such as the PRIDE archive. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing ( www.fairsharing.org ), at the latest at the time of publication. For all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows: -Digital datasets: files will be stored on the “L-drive”. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☐ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Other data repository (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Vectors: will be deposited in public repositories such as Addgene. Protein or nucleic acid sequences: will be deposited in GenBank and/or published as supplemental data files as appropriate. Proteomics data: will be deposited in public repositories such as the PRIDE archive. When will the data be made available? ☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. Check the RDR guidance on licences for data and software sources code or consult the License selector tool to help you choose. ☒ CC-BY 4.0 (data) ☐ Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) ☐ MIT licence (code) ☐ GNU GPL-3.0 (code) ☐ Other (specify) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☒ No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. 7. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project?With respect to E-Notebook: René Custers and Alexander Botzki With respect to other datatypes: Pierre Vanderhaeghen Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project?Pierre Vanderhaeghen Who will manage data preservation and sharing?Pierre Vanderhaeghen Who will update and implement this DMP?
