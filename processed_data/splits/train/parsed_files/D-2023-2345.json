Yes The major aim of the present project is to obtain more insight in the pathophysiology of IBS with the ultimate goal to discover novel therapeutic targets. Discoveries will be patented following consultation of and close interaction with LRD. Concerns: mast cell gene targets, DRG gene targets, macrophage gene targets. Our models and know-how will be of interest for industrial partners, such as Takeda, Eli Lily, Viatris, and GSK, leading to new contracts and further valorisation of our research. Concerns IBs models (PI-IBS, WAS-IBS), abdominal pain measurement (VMR), pain sensitivity (patch- clamp).

Standard operation procedures (SOPs) have been written for all the techniques used in the lab. Data obtained from a study protocol / series of experiments will be stored in a folder that also contains a readme.txt file explaining the design/protocol, results and labels used in the data analysis file, and a reference to the lab journal of that particular experiment. Also the method of analysis will be described. The information provided will allow another researcher to follow all steps in the data processing.

Yes Metadata will be created for the transcriptomics using the Dublin core (http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards/dublin-core). Flow cytometry metadata will be generated as part of the Flow Cytometry Standard data file, according to the ISAC standards (https://isac- net.org/page/Data-Standards). Microscopic metadata will be generated using the OME-TIFF or OXE-XML standard (www.fairsharing.org). Other metastandard are not available yet (http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadatastandardsOR http://rd-alliance.github.io/metadatadirectory/standards/OR https://fairsharing.org/). In these cases, metadata will be included in the read-me file, including description of equipment and settings used and experimental conditions.

How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Data files are stored on the J drive of KU Leuven which is protected via a central login for KUL personnel. Identity of included patients is encoded, i.e. a unique number (hospital patient number) coupled to a unique CRF (case report form) number. The file containing the link between the CRF number and the patient’s identity is saved in a dedicated folder on the J drive which is only accessible by the PI and trial nurse via an entrance code. In case data are stored on managed laptops, the hard drive is encrypted. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The extra costs approximate 160 euro per TB/year (per blocks of 5 TB). The costs will be paid from this project. The freezers to store tissue samples are purchased by the different PIs and located in the UZ Leuven biobank at no cost. The costs of a -80°C freezer is around 3000-5000 euro.

All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain below) Remaining physical pertaining to the previously described datasets cannot be kept for 10 years as their integrity degrades with time.

The estimated amount of data (scRNAseq data excluded) can be stored on the K drive, KU Leuven ICTS. If needed, an upgrade will be requested at 156,60 euro/TB/year. The expected maximum data volume of 2 TB will cost a total of 3200€ for 10 years (2 x160 euro/yr x 10 years). The costs will be paid from the current project.
