RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .Per work package, all input, output data, and scripts will be collected. Specific folders will be created to contain (1) input data, (2) processing files, and (3) output data. Included in the Input Data folder will be a text file with a clear description of what the data within the folder represent, including the type, format, source of each dataset, and dates acquired. Any scripts or intermediate data used to generate output data will be kept in the Processing folder with a corresponding text file describing applied tools and methodology used to process the data, as well as explanations of the file names. The Output data folder will house all final processing outputs to be used in further work packages and will also have a text file describing each output data as well as how they were generated. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: For all input data, a text file will be made as described previously (above). For R scripts, RMarkdown will be used to maintain metadata within the script including the date the script was made, developer of the script, a short explanation of the target of the script, necessary packages, necessary input data and explanation of the output, reference to data to which the script was applied and user rights and acknowledgements. A single text file will combine metadata from all R scripts for easier reference. For Python scripts, markdown fields will be used to maintain metadata within the script, with information similar to the R scripts. For generated results, a text file will be made containing the date that the results were obtained, the coordinates and/or study area, the author of the data, a short description of the results, a reference to the script used to generate the results (if available), the file format, and the user rights and acknowledgements. See output data described previously (above). 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored?

Original versions of data needing privacy requirements will be stored on the KU Leuven OneDrive and Personal network drive (I-drive) only accessible by the main researcher. Scripts and processed data will be stored on OneDrive. A back-up of the processed data stored on OneDrive will be made monthly on an external hard drive. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No Enough cloud storage is available on the server of the Division Forest, Nature and Landscape in KU Leuven’s secure OneDrive. An external hard drive of 5TB is also available for this project. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data The data will be stored on OneDrive, which is a secure, enterprise cloud storage service equipped with multifactor authentication from the KU Leuven (KU Leuven Authenticator). What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?The data storage volumes for cloud storage provided by the Department will suffice. Additional offline backups will be done on external hard drives (estimated cost €200 for 5TB). 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☒ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) The data provided by Sciensano will not be retained after the end of the project as we only have the right to use it and not share it. All other data created during this project will be retained for the expected 10 year period. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?The unprocessed input data will not be preserved during the retention period. Therefore, the size of the data is expected to be less than 100GB. The data will be stored on the university’s central servers. The expected cost for preserving this data is €13 per year. This cost will be covered by the working budget of Ben Somers, the main promotor. 6.
