The work packages will have a subfolder for each type of data (e.g., audio files, transcripts, visualisations, images, survey responses). Each file name will follow this structure: 1 . Case study number (1, 2, 3, or none) 2 . Data Description (e.g.Interview) 3 . Date in format: YYYYMMDD The folder structure and file naming conventions will be described in a README.txt file in the main project folder.

How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Data will be securely stored in OneDrive, with full access restricted to the PhD researcher. Documents can be selectively shared with supervisors via OneDrive. If documents need to be shared outside the research project (e.g., within the research group), this will be done with restricted access—shared via email with view-only permissions. Physical documents will be securely stored in a locked drawer accessible only to the PhD researcher. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project?

Last modiﬁed 26 November 2024 4 of 7 Most data will be retained for 10 years to support reproducibility and potential follow-up research. However, personal data that is not essential for long-term analysis will be deleted when it is no longer necessary: IP addresses collected during online surveys, used to ensure each participant is unique, will be deleted immediately after verification. Contact details for participants will be deleted once they are no longer needed for ongoing communication or study invitations. Additionally, audio recordings will be deleted after transcription to prevent potential identification of participants. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?
