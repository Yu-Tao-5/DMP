General Information\nName applicant\nMarkus Wöhr\nFWO Project Number & Title\nG0E6722N; Socio-Affective Communication through Ultrasonic Vocalizations in Mouse Models for\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders: Neurexins, Neuroligins and their Functions in Parvalbumin\nInterneurons\nAffiliation\nKU Leuven\n2. Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nResearch activities in G0E6722N will result in a variety of data types, both at KU Leuven and the\nlaboratory of the Chinese collaborator, the Shenzhen Bay Laboratory. At KU Leuven, data types\ninclude primarily: (1) video files (mouse behavior, avi-files or mp4-files, circa 4-5 TB, recorded\nwith video cameras connected to a computer) and (2) audio files (mouse ultrasonic vocalizations,\nwav-files, circa 4-5 TB, recorded with ultrasound microphones connected to a computer).\nAdditionally, (3) automated behavioral measurements (e.g. locomotor activity, nose-poking) will\nbe recorded in Excel (xlsx-files, circa 2-3 MB, recorded with infrared light sensors connected to a\ncomputer). Of note, recordings of mouse ultrasonic vocalizations are relatively large in size, with\none hour of recording resulting in about 2 GB. Video files will likewise result in a significant\namount of data.\nIn China, data types include electrophysiological recordings, in vivo calcium imaging, and images\nfrom fluorescence microscopy of mouse brain sections (e.g. for neuromorphological analyses) as\nwell as biochemical and molecular biology data (e.g. western blot, agarose gels, qRT-PCR).\nElectrophysiological data are collected with Axon 700B. In vivo calcium imaging data is collected\nwith Olympus FVMPE-RS.\nAll data will be stored in digital form (e.g. AVI or MP4 files for video recordings, WAV files for\naudio recordings, TIFF files for gel images, BAM files for RNA sequencing data). Measurements\nderived from video and audio files, microscopy images, sequencing datasets, etc. will be\nrecorded in Excel (for long-term preservation, converted into CSV files) and SPSS for statistical\nanalyses. Manuscripts will be written in Word. Biomaterials include mouse brain and tail samples.\n3. Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNo\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 4\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nYes\nECD, formal approval by the relevant ethical review committee is pending.\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nYes\nIt is a collaborative project with China. Both KU Leuven and the Chinese collaborator from the\nShenzhen Bay Laboratory signed a collaboration agreement specifying all relevant project\ndetails, which was approved by a lawyer at KU Leuven.  \n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nStandardized protocols (SOPs, including all relevant details of experimental setup and\nprocedures) will be applied and enforced by the head lab manager/ lab technician.\nFor video files (mouse behavior) the following information will be noted: mouse ID(s), date, time,\nprotocol (i.e. SOP), and experimenter. The methodology and protocol will be described in detail in\nthe lab book.\nFor audio files (mouse ultrasonic vocalizations) the following information will be noted: mouse\nID(s), date, time, protocol (i.e. SOP), and experimenter. The methodology and protocol will be\ndescribed in detail in the lab book.\nFor automated behavioral measurements (e.g. locomotor activity, nose-poking) the following\ninformation will be noted: mouse ID(s), date, time, protocol (i.e. SOP), and experimenter. The\nmethodology and protocol will be described in detail in the lab book.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nMetadata include a unique mouse ID, together with its birth date, genotype, sex, and\nexperimental condition. All other data are linked to the individual animal through the unique\nmouse ID only (but not birth date, genotype, sex, and experimental condition) to avoid a bias\nduring data acquisition and analysis. After completing relevant parts of the data acquisition\nprocess, data will be merged in SPSS linking all relevant data through the unique mouse ID.  \n \n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nThere are several provisions in place in order to preserve the data during and after the end of the\nresearch at KU Leuven and the Shenzhen Bay Laboratory. According to the Research Data\nManagement policy at KU Leuven, relevant research data will be kept for at least 10 years after\nthe end of the research. At KU Leuven, data will be stored on hard drives during experiments.\nAfter the experiments, data will be transferred to two external hard drives (two copies; one\nworking copy and one backup copy) and metadata will additionally be transferred to the large,\nsafe, and automatically backed up central network device of KU Leuven, OneDrive. In addition, it\nis planned to make exemplary audio files, i.e. recordings of ultrasonic vocalizations, available to\nthe scientific community through an online platform, e.g. mouseTube. Furthermore, it is planned\nto upload metadata of key confirmatory studies to a general repository (e.g. Open Science\nFramework). For optimal storage of biomaterials, fridges, -20°C freezers, and -80°C freezers will\nbe used.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 4\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nAt KU Leuven, the data will be stored on external hard drives (two copies; one working copy and\none backup copy) and metadata will be additionally transferred to the university's central servers\nwith automatic daily backup procedures, for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM\npolicy.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project?
