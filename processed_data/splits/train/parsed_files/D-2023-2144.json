However, this post-transcriptional\nphenomenon has been understudied due to technological limitations,\nwhere only few genes could be assayed. Recently, novel\ntechnologies have been proposed for highly-multiplexed, subcellular-\nresolution in situ assaying of transcripts. Here we propose the\napplication of such cutting-edge technologies on well-described\nbiological models (fruit fly, intestinal enterocyte polarization, axonic\nand dendritic growth in the brain, human and mouse embryo\ndevelopment) to perform a large-scale study of RNA localization\npatterns, their molecular actors and functional consequences. To\nachieve this, we propose the development of novel computational\nanalysis strategies for the automated characterization of spatial\nexpression patterns using deep convolutional autoencoder neural\nnetworks. This will allow us to describe known and novel genes\nwhich rely on specific localization to perform their function, providing\ndeeper insights into the molecular biology of the studied models.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 32.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

However, this post-transcriptional phenomenon has been understudied due to technological limitations, where only few genes could be assayed. Recently, novel technologies have been proposed for highly-multiplexed, subcellular- resolution in situ assaying of transcripts. Here we propose the application of such cutting-edge technologies on well-described biological models (fruit fly, intestinal enterocyte polarization, axonic and dendritic growth in the brain, human and mouse embryo development) to perform a large-scale study of RNA localization patterns, their molecular actors and functional consequences. To achieve this, we propose the development of novel computational analysis strategies for the automated characterization of spatial expression patterns using deep convolutional autoencoder neural networks. This will allow us to describe known and novel genes which rely on specific localization to perform their function, providing deeper insights into the molecular biology of the studied models.

How will these costs be covered?We have budgeted for 200TB of data storage at 30 Euro/TB/year for the lifetime of the project (as part of the FWO funding). Long-term post-project storage will be covered by complementary project funding (VLIR RELANCE infrastructure grant). 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☒ KU Leuven RDR (for publication data) ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): We have budgeted long-term large-scale cold archiving storage as part of a VLIR RELANCE infrastructure grant. We’re currently working out potential hardware solutions with KUL RDM ICTS. Sequencing data will be deposited to EGA/GEO data repositories. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?We have budgeted long-term large-scale cold archiving storage (10 Euro/TB/year) as part of a VLIR RELANCE infrastructure grant. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☒ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: Non-human data will be made openly available. Human data will be deposited in either public data repositories under a controlled data access policy with a data access committee evaluating data access requests. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Access to human data will be granted by the data access committee to bonafide researchers affiliated with recognized research institutions. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☒ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☒ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify: Data access to human data will restricted according to the specified clauses in the informed consent forms for the different studies. Specifically sequencing data will be mostly restricted given the identifiability of the subjects. Microscopy imaging data will be made publicly available. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☒ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Other data repository (specify) EGA/GEO (scRNAseq) ☐ Other (specify) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12When will the data be made available? ☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. Check the RDR guidance on licences for data and software sources code or consult the License selector tool to help you choose. ☐ CC-BY 4.0 (data) ☒ Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) ☐ MIT licence (code) ☒ GNU GPL-3.0 (code) ☐ Other (specify) Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☒ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☐ No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? We don’t expect additional costs for data sharing 7. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project?David Wouters FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project?David Wouters Who will manage data preservation and sharing?Alejandro Sifrim Who will update and implement this DMP?
