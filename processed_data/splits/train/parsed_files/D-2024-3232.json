Data will be generated following standardized protocols. Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (Enotebook) and/or in hard copy lab notebooks that refer to specific datasets. elabFTW (Electronic lab notebook) is also used to store test hypothesis descriptions, solution compositions, descriptions and links to protocols related to the experiment. All datasets will be accompanied by a README.txt file containing all the associated metadata (see more details below). All data files + folders will be saved on the KU Leuven One-drive and Large Volume storage. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data?

No Metadata for all the tasks will be created by the instruments (eg. RT-qPCR, calcium imaging, sequencing). In other cases metadata will be collected manually according to the type of data. Metadata will include the following elements: • Title: free text • Creator: Last name, first name, organization • Date and time reference • Subject: Choice of keywords and classifications • Description: Text explaining the content of the data set and other contextual information needed for the correct interpretation of the data, the software(s) (including version number) used to produce and to read the data, the purpose of the experiment, etc. • Format: Details of the file format Additionally, we will closely monitor MIBBI (Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations) for metadata. For specific datasets, additional metadata will be associated with the data file as appropriate. Specific examples information on the methodology used to collect the data analytical and procedural information how raw data have been processed into other forms of data standard operating procedures (SOPs), logbooks, lab protocols parameters and instrument settings for image acquisition, measurements, models or other techniques The final dataset will be accompanied by this information under the form of a README.txt document. This file will be in the top-level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used. This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3.

How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Samples will be stored in the archive of O&N3, Campus Gasthuisberg. This room has a separate key to open the door. Access to O&N3 is controlled by electronic badge readers. The primary storage location for the data is on password-protected KU Leuven personal computers, with immediate backup to secure network-attached, redundant disk arrays managed by the lab, accessible only to selected members of the lab. Long term storage for data that does not require repeated fast access is provided by the KU Leuven ICTS' Large Volume Storage service.
