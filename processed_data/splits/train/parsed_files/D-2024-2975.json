In this proposal, we address two particular\nproblems related to the BEM, both of which are impeding the application of the BEM to our area of interest, that is, sound propagation in enclosures,\ni.e., room acoustics.\nFirstly, the BEM is most often applied in the frequency domain, representing a steady-state solution to a wave propagation problem. However, in order\nto represent wave fields generated by spatiotemporally nonstationary sources, a time-domain approach is needed. Time-domain BEM has only been\nscarcely considered as it is prone to instability problems. Secondly, the accuracy of the BEM solution is highly dependent on an accurate formulation\nof the boundary conditions, hence requiring a detailed characterization of the material properties of the enclosure, which is often infeasible.\nBoth problems will be addressed by exploiting a formulation of the BEM that has remained underexplored in literature. The time-domain boundary\nintegral equation from which the BEM is derived, can be rewritten into a continuous-time, discrete-space state-space model. This representation will\nfirstly allow to understand how stability can be preserved when moving from continuous to discrete time. Secondly, it naturally leads to the\nformulation of a state-space realization problem that yields the perspective to estimate the boundary conditions from impulse response measurements.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n30-06-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

In this proposal, we address two particular problems related to the BEM, both of which are impeding the application of the BEM to our area of interest, that is, sound propagation in enclosures, i.e., room acoustics. Firstly, the BEM is most often applied in the frequency domain, representing a steady-state solution to a wave propagation problem. However, in order to represent wave fields generated by spatiotemporally nonstationary sources, a time-domain approach is needed. Time-domain BEM has only been scarcely considered as it is prone to instability problems. Secondly, the accuracy of the BEM solution is highly dependent on an accurate formulation of the boundary conditions, hence requiring a detailed characterization of the material properties of the enclosure, which is often infeasible. Both problems will be addressed by exploiting a formulation of the BEM that has remained underexplored in literature. The time-domain boundary integral equation from which the BEM is derived, can be rewritten into a continuous-time, discrete-space state-space model. This representation will firstly allow to understand how stability can be preserved when moving from continuous to discrete time. Secondly, it naturally leads to the formulation of a state-space realization problem that yields the perspective to estimate the boundary conditions from impulse response measurements.

If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes The research unit provides sufficient storage facilities for our current needs. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The storage used by the research unit is backed up daily. The backup process is managed by the IT division of the department (ESAT). For all data stored in the department's servers, access is regulated by an access control list (ACL) that grants read-write access to the project owner and read-only access to specific users. The ACL is managed by the project owner. Client computers can access the data using: SMB2 (or higher) from specific IP ranges NFSv4 from specific (IT managed) systems.
