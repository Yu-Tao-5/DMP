We can then measure the brain\nwaves using EEG, decode them and draw conclusions about the auditory system. To that end, we aim to develop a computational model\nof the auditory system, based on state-of-the-art, deep-neural-network-based systems for automatic speech recognition. The model will\nbe constructed by letting people listen to natural speech signals, and relating the recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) signal to the\ncorresponding acoustic signals. One of the outcomes of this project is brain wave decoders that can be used in novel neuro-steered\nhearing aids and potentially as a brain-computer interface. Furthermore, by modeling the auditory system, we can pinpoint the origin of\nhearing disorders which gives invaluable information for the diagnostics of the auditory system. This has applications in clinical\ndiagnostics of hearing and the design of smart hearing aids.\nLast modified: \n28-04-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Documentation and Metadata\nClearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in\nthe future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is\nrecorded).\nNew lab members get a training on how to perform the experiments how and where to store and handle the collected data. Furthermore, standard guidelines and instructions are available as .pdf\nand/or .readme, stored on network drive. They contain best practices regarding the practical side of your experiment  (set-up, parameters,...) as well as policies about how to treat the subjects,\nhow to handle and where to keep sensitive information, etc. In this way, the information given during the training can easily be re-read, refreshed.\nThis, in combination with the fact that the original collected data, are stored on backed-up drives, in a standard format, should make it possible to understand and reuse the data. The data will be\nstored based on the BIDS structure (see below).\nThe code corresponding to each result will be stored on a git repository. This way, reusers will be able to recreate the results. The commentary lines in the code also document how the data is\norganized and how a result can be obtained, for this we will use regular code and comments but also Jupyter notebooks. Moreover, the code also contains an implicit description of how the\ncollected data is organized, it can be used as an explanation of the data.\n \nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be\nused. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.\nYes\nThe data will be stored based on the BIDS structure, an organization structure for neuroimaging and behavioral data (see also the website: bids.neuroimaging.io). This structure will be used to\narrange the data in an uniform way.\n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nThe data will be stored on KU Leuven administered drives (large volume storage). In\norder to be able to analyse the data, some files will need (temporarily) to be stored on\nthe encrypted PC hard drive (this since calculations from a non-local source are too\nslow and lead to computational failures). Once analysed, the raw data are again\nremoved from the local hard drives\nHow will the data be backed up?\nSince the data are stored on KU Leuven storage, the general ICT back-up Policy is\napplied.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nYes. Since the data are stored on KU Leuven servers, and these drives are\nexpandable in blocks, the backup capacity is technically not an issue.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nThe lab policy is that the researchers have only access to the data from the project\nthey are involved in. Furthermore, the data for longer term storage are kept on separate\ndrives with a) limited access (only a limited set of people have access) and b) an\noverwrite and delete protection (based on read-write access) in order to prevent\naccidental loss of these data.\nProf. Francart is the only person who has access to the key information for\nidentification of the subjects. His back-up (only to be used in extreme case) is Jan\nWouters and Astrid van Wieringen (both PI’s within the lab).\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nThe estimated cost is around 7.000 Euro (157EUR/TB/year) and will be paid from the\nC1-C2 project under which this FWO proposal is falling.\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be\npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\nAs mentioned in our informed consent, medical data will be retained for at least 30 years and other research data for at least 20 years.\n \nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 28 April 2023\n6 of 8\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nThe data are stored on a KU Leuven, ICT managed Large Volume Storage, drives especially designed for archive storage. Personal data, will be kept in a similar, secure way. However, these data\nwill be stored at a different location (different server) with other (restricted) access rights (see also above).\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nThe estimated cost is around 11.000 Euro (14TB @ 157EUR/TB/year). Given the way\nprojects are financed at KU Leuven, we cannot predict whether funding will be\navailable after the current C2 project ends, unless we are allowed to set aside funding\nfrom the C2 project for later use.\n5. Data sharing and reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made\navailable.\nOther, please specify:\nTo be decided, this will depend on IP issues (if there are \"No (closed access)\", otherwise \"Yes in a restricted access repository\".\nDataset: \"A large auditory EEG decoding dataset\" (and extension)\nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.\nThe informed consent contains a section in which the participant can choose whether his/her data is shared. Possibilities are:\nno sharing allowed\nsharing within KU Leuven\nsharing within the European Union\nworldwide sharing\nworldwide sharing and the data can be made available on a public database\nWe will honour their choice. Furthermore, shared data will always be pseudonymised.\nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment\nsection per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nYes, Privacy aspects\nYes, Intellectual Property Rights\nTo be decided. Of course the key to identify the subject from which the data were\nobtained, is not sharable (without the consent of the subject).\nIt will also depend on IP issues.\nWhere will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.\nDataset: \"A large auditory EEG decoding dataset\": \nhttps://doi.org/10.48804/K3VSND\nDataset: \"A large auditory EEG decoding dataset\" (extension): not yet applicable\nWhen will the data be made available?\nDataset: already available (\nhttps://doi.org/10.48804/K3VSND\n)\nDataset extension: upon publication of research results.\nWhich data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why.\nThe already available dataset has CC-BY-NC-4.0, so the extension will probably have the same usage license.\nDo you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section.\nYes\nDataset: \nhttps://doi.org/10.48804/K3VSND\nDataset extension: not yet available\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nDataset: free\nDataset extension: the research data repository (RDR) is free below 50G, it may not be free anymore as we extend it upon research publication.\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Responsibilities\nWho will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project?\nThe researcher, when his contract has ended, the responsibility shifts towards Prof. Francart & Prof. Van hamme to ensure data preservation and reuse. \nWho will manage data storage and backup during the research project?\nBack-up of the data is arranged by ICTS- KU Leuven (back-up policy dependent on the kind of storage). \nWho will manage data preservation and sharing?\nThe PI through highly restricted overwrite and delete authorisation. It is also the PI’s decision which data are shared with other co-workers and how this will be arranged. \nWho will update and implement this DMP?\nThe PIs (Prof. Tom Francart and Prof. Hugo Van hamme) bear the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP. \nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Furthermore, the data for longer term storage are kept on separate drives with a) limited access (only a limited set of people have access) and b) an overwrite and delete protection (based on read-write access) in order to prevent accidental loss of these data. Prof. Francart is the only person who has access to the key information for identification of the subjects. His back-up (only to be used in extreme case) is Jan Wouters and Astrid van Wieringen (both PI’s within the lab). What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The estimated cost is around 7.000 Euro (157EUR/TB/year) and will be paid from the C1-C2 project under which this FWO proposal is falling. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). As mentioned in our informed consent, medical data will be retained for at least 30 years and other research data for at least 20 years. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 28 April 2023 6 of 8 Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? The data are stored on a KU Leuven, ICT managed Large Volume Storage, drives especially designed for archive storage. Personal data, will be kept in a similar, secure way. However, these data will be stored at a different location (different server) with other (restricted) access rights (see also above). What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The estimated cost is around 11.000 Euro (14TB @ 157EUR/TB/year). Given the way projects are financed at KU Leuven, we cannot predict whether funding will be available after the current C2 project ends, unless we are allowed to set aside funding from the C2 project for later use. 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Other, please specify: To be decided, this will depend on IP issues (if there are \"No (closed access)\", otherwise \"Yes in a restricted access repository\". Dataset: \"A large auditory EEG decoding dataset\" (and extension) If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. The informed consent contains a section in which the participant can choose whether his/her data is shared. Possibilities are: no sharing allowed sharing within KU Leuven sharing within the European Union worldwide sharing worldwide sharing and the data can be made available on a public database We will honour their choice. Furthermore, shared data will always be pseudonymised. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes, Privacy aspects Yes, Intellectual Property Rights To be decided. Of course the key to identify the subject from which the data were obtained, is not sharable (without the consent of the subject). It will also depend on IP issues. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. Dataset: \"A large auditory EEG decoding dataset\": https://doi.org/10.48804/K3VSND Dataset: \"A large auditory EEG decoding dataset\" (extension): not yet applicable When will the data be made available? Dataset: already available ( https://doi.org/10.48804/K3VSND ) Dataset extension: upon publication of research results. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. The already available dataset has CC-BY-NC-4.0, so the extension will probably have the same usage license. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. Yes Dataset: https://doi.org/10.48804/K3VSND Dataset extension: not yet available What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Dataset: free Dataset extension: the research data repository (RDR) is free below 50G, it may not be free anymore as we extend it upon research publication. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 28 April 2023 7 of 8 6. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project? The researcher, when his contract has ended, the responsibility shifts towards Prof. Francart & Prof. Van hamme to ensure data preservation and reuse. Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project? Back-up of the data is arranged by ICTS- KU Leuven (back-up policy dependent on the kind of storage). Who will manage data preservation and sharing? The PI through highly restricted overwrite and delete authorisation. It is also the PI’s decision which data are shared with other co-workers and how this will be arranged. Who will update and implement this DMP? The PIs (Prof. Tom Francart and Prof. Hugo Van hamme) bear the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 28 April 2023 8 of 8"
