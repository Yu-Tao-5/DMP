The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning.

Immobility refers to  the spatial condition of staying put, the experience  when \nwaiting indefinitely, and the feeling of being stuck. Aiming to nuance the existing overlooked  literature on \nimmobility, this project bridges with citizenship studies and adopts  an extra focus on undocumented \nactivism as a method to contest systematic forces on immobility. The community of overstayed domestic \nworker activists in Brussels is chosen as the case study because of the researcher’s  existing network, the \nlack of scholarly attention  on Belgium’s undocumented domestic workers and Brussels’ relevance for \nundocumented activism. This  project adopts anthropological methods of long-term participant \nobservation, in-depth interviews, and collaborative (auto)ethnographies, combined with  qualitative policy \nanalysis, to achieve three objectives. The three objectives are to 1)  theorise overstayers’ reasons for \nchoosing overstaying immobility, 2) identify regimes’  socio-legal policies that force overstaying immobility \nand 3) measure overstayers' activist strategies to contest the forced overstaying immobility.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

Their personal data that might \nreveal their identity (includ.names and birth dates) will be strictly protected.  \nThis research involves interviewing of and fieldnote-taking about migrant domestic workers who have \nexperience overstaying  in Belgiuim. It will involve pseudonymisation of qualitative data. The principle is to  \nstrictly keep their direct identified information between me and the interlocutors, and to make their \nidentities as untraceable as possible to third parties. At the beginning of my data collection, I will inform \nthem  with an information letter that their traceable  personal details (direct identifier), such as legal \nnames, birthplace, birthdates, and concrete residential location, will not be used in this research. If such \ninformation shows up in the recorded interviews, they will be erased or falsified upon transcription. I will \nrecommend them to give me false personal information, especially pseudonym. Considering that some of \nthem might want to use their legal name for this research because they might think it would help them \nwith future regularization, I will inform all participants and ensure that all their names will be \npseudonymised again after data collection.       I will retrive indirect personal information relevant to their \nmigration trajectories and experiences without revealing their sensitive personal information such as legal \nnames and residencies.  \nTo further secure their privacy, all collected audio recordings will be immediately erased after \ntranscription and within 48 hours after the interview is conducted. The audio recording will be stored in \nand deleted from my encrypted laptop and  KU Leuven Onedrive. My hand-written fieldnotes will also be \ndestroyed after being transferred to a Word document in my encrypted laptop. The fieldnotes document, \nthe transcription of interviews and my interlocutors’ other personal data will be stored in my laptop, KU \nLeuven One Drive, and a hard drive encrypted by KU Leuven ITCS. The pseudonimisation process will be \nfinalised during transcription and field-note digitalisation. During the analysis and writing up, all data will \nbe saved on my work laptop, KU Leuven OneDrive, and an encrypted hard drive. By the date of  my thesis \ndefense, I will delete all my interlocutors'  contact details,  and will follow my promoter's advice to store or  \ndestroy all the rest of the data (e.g. interview transcriptions and field notes), depending on the political \nand academic situation by the end of this project.  \nMy interlocutors' contact information will only be saved in my encrypted personal phone with  a \npseudonomised name. I will be the only one who knows the passwords to my phone. Their contact data \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 8will only be used for communication between them and me, and will be deleted after this research is \nfinished, by the day of my thesis defence.  I will know whom the name in my thesis refers to becasue this \nresearch requires 18 months of participant observation with my interlocutors. I will not  investigate \nwhether the names given or used by the interlocutors are their legal names. Note that some interlocutors \nuse multiple names and it is already difficulty to identify them by the name they commonly use.  However,  \nother interlocutors in the field or anyone who are familiar with the pseudonymised subject could possibly \nrecognize their identities through the combination of the migration trajectories, country of origins, and \nother details. \nThis research also involves interviewing of  professionals who specialise on policies that affect migrant \ndomestic workers' conditions in Belgium. I will pseudonymise their names but give credits to their \norganisation, especially when the organistaions  are well-known in the public sector.  Upon request and \nafter consultation with my supervisor, I may  give credit to the professional in my acknowledgement part.\nAfter data generation, the thesis and articles will be published and identifiable by DOI.\nWill a metadata standard be used to make it \neasier to find and reuse the data ? \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard \nwill be used.

The KU Leuven OneDrive can be accessed from the KU \nLeuven university network, which is available by an encrypted VPN-connection or web interface. They \nrequire authentication the researcher herself, which can only be approved from an installed app that \nrequires her username and password in KU Leuven, as well as her Face ID.  \nMoreover, the researcher’s work laptop is strictly set up by KU Leuven ICTS, based on strict security \nstandard that limits the access to the researcher and certain ICTS supervisor, upon request of the \nresearcher and in case of emergency.  \nDuring collection, data will be backed up on my work laptop and secured with Windows Bitlocker, with \ncopies uploaded to OneDrive and a hard drive encrypted by KU Leuven ITCS. Before transcription, only the \nresearcher knows where the hand-written fieldnote is kept. The fieldnotes are written in a code-switching \nChinese, French and English, which makes it difficult for anyone other than the researcher to understand.  \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?Free access to KU Leuven 50 GB storage is provided by ITCS. Cost for an encrypted hard drive will be \napprox.. 100 Euros, and a work computer will be appox. 500 Euros. They will be covered by my FWO bench  \nfee. \n5.

Because my data will be collected from \nundocumented people and the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) protects my interlocutors' \nprivacy. Under GDPR, informed consent must specify the duration of data retention, the methods of data \ncollection, and the conditions for sharing the data or not. If informal consent were not to be met, we \nshould respect undocumented people’s choices to not store their data for any specific period of time.  In \nthis research, I will delete my interlocutors' data after the research is finished (by the date of my thesis \ndefence), because future misuse of undocumented people's data might bring unflavourable legal and \nsocial consequences on my interlocutors and research institute.\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long-term)?\nDedicated data repositories  are often the best place \nto preserve your data.

Note that some interlocutors use multiple names and it is already difficulty to identify them by the name they commonly use. However, other interlocutors in the field or anyone who are familiar with the pseudonymised subject could possibly recognize their identities through the combination of the migration trajectories, country of origins, and other details. This research also involves interviewing of professionals who specialise on policies that affect migrant domestic workers' conditions in Belgium. I will pseudonymise their names but give credits to their organisation, especially when the organistaions are well-known in the public sector. Upon request and after consultation with my supervisor, I may give credit to the professional in my acknowledgement part. After data generation, the thesis and articles will be published and identifiable by DOI. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data.☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☐ Other: How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? ☒ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☒ Personal back-ups I make (specify) I will scan all my hand-written fieldnotes and back up my interview recordings to KU Leuven one drive, an encrypted hard drive set up by KU Leuven ICTS and my Bitlocker encrypted work computer. ☐ Other (specify) Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If no, please specify: Considering my fieldwork includes fieldnotes, recorded and transcribed interviews, KU Leuven ICTS will provide me with sufficient 50 GB data storage and backup capacities. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data All the digital access are strictly limited to the researcher’s KU Leuven account, which KU Leuven ITCS has and will set up based on their security training. The KU Leuven OneDrive can be accessed from the KU Leuven university network, which is available by an encrypted VPN-connection or web interface. They require authentication the researcher herself, which can only be approved from an installed app that requires her username and password in KU Leuven, as well as her Face ID. Moreover, the researcher’s work laptop is strictly set up by KU Leuven ICTS, based on strict security standard that limits the access to the researcher and certain ICTS supervisor, upon request of the researcher and in case of emergency. During collection, data will be backed up on my work laptop and secured with Windows Bitlocker, with copies uploaded to OneDrive and a hard drive encrypted by KU Leuven ITCS. Before transcription, only the researcher knows where the hand-written fieldnote is kept. The fieldnotes are written in a code-switching Chinese, French and English, which makes it difficult for anyone other than the researcher to understand. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Free access to KU Leuven 50 GB storage is provided by ITCS. Cost for an encrypted hard drive will be approx.. 100 Euros, and a work computer will be appox. 500 Euros. They will be covered by my FWO bench fee. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☐ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☒ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) I will store the data only under my interlocutors' consent. Because my data will be collected from undocumented people and the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) protects my interlocutors' privacy. Under GDPR, informed consent must specify the duration of data retention, the methods of data collection, and the conditions for sharing the data or not. If informal consent were not to be met, we should respect undocumented people’s choices to not store their data for any specific period of time. In this research, I will delete my interlocutors' data after the research is finished (by the date of my thesis defence), because future misuse of undocumented people's data might bring unflavourable legal and social consequences on my interlocutors and research institute. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☒ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specify): encrypted personal computer and recording device; physical notebook. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Unknown. They will be covered by my bench fee. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS.
