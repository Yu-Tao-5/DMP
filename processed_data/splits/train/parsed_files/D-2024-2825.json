Nevertheless, the number of qubits on a chip still needs to scale up by several orders of magnitude to\ntranscend such algorithmic demonstrations and enable useful quantum computation. A major hurdle to this scale-up is the use of ferrite-\nbased isolators to protect the superconducting quantum systems from their noisy electromagnetic environment. Indeed, due to the bulky\nmagnets required to bias the ferrite, only a limited number of such isolators can fit inside the dilution fridge that hosts the superconducting\nquantum system. \nTo tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach to microwave magnet-less isolation based on parametric mode conversion in\ndispersion-engineered coupled transmission lines. Specifically, we use composite right-left-handed (CRLH) transmission lines to\nengineer parallel dispersion curves for the even and odd modes of the coupled structures, and hence achieve broadband phase\nmatching. We anticipate that this approach, implemented with foundry compatible process, will overcome the current trade-off between\nisolation, bandwidth, and device compactness, opening the path to large-scale integration of superconducting quantum processors. \nLast modified: \n17-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
