In fact, women writers had to carefully craft and renegotiate their authorial identities in\ntheir writing. Their life writing in particular was essential to both their authorial practice and self-\nfashioning. This project investigates the hypothesis that especially Enlightenment women\nwriters, who lived in the transition period from crossing to defending linguistic, cultural and\nnational borders, used multilingualism in their life writing as a strategy for authorial self-\nfashioning. The project therefore innovatively charts and compares the forms and functions of\nmultilingualism in the letters and (travel) journals of Enlightenment women writers who lived,\nworked and travelled between the internationally renowned centres of the Republic of Letters. In\ndoing so, the project will, first and foremost, shed new light on how Enlightenment women\nwriters actively (re)shaped their authorial identity and authority. It will thereby challenge\nprevious visions on the forms and functions of multilingualism in Enlightenment Europe and\nprovide the empirical stepping stone towards a new methodological framework for the study of\nearly modern multilingualism.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

I will ensure to comply with\ncopyright laws and take all necessary steps to obtain permission for using or quoting from\ncertain documents. Hence, copyright laws will not restrict the dissemination of the project's\nresults.\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nIn general, each folder and document containing research data will receive a transparent\nfolder or file name. In the case of primary and secondary sources (corpus and books/articles\nused for referencing), for instance, the name of the author and the title of the work will be\nmentioned in the file name. \nThe collection of documents containing research data will be accompanied by a seperate\ndocument (a .txt file) that describes the data and the data gathering process. The KU\nLeuven template for README.txt files will be used to structure the .txt file.\nIn case documents get updated along the way, the concept of versioning will be applied. By\nsaving multiple versions, the PI can easily keep track of minor and major changes.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nYes\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 5\nAll data created in NVivo (insights from primary sources) will automatically possess certain\nmetadata: name, location, modification history. These metadata can be found under ‘Code\nproperties’ or ‘Annotation properties’. Only when this data will be downloaded and published\nor integrated in existing databases, the Dublin Core Standard will be used to include\nadditional rich metadata.\nAs the insights from the secondary literature review will mainly be created in MS Office (MS\nWord in particular), they automatically possess the following metadata: file name,\nauthor/creator, date. These metadata can be found under ‘File’ > ‘Properties’.\nBooks and articles used for future referencing will be structured in the reference manager\nZotero. This reference manager automatically generates certain metadata: title, creator,\npublisher and other data needed to cite the items in publications.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nDuring the project, all data will be stored on a personal KU Leuven OneDrive for Business account\nprovided by the Faculty of Arts.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nData will be back-upped regularly and automatically using the personal KU Leuven OneDrive\naccount provided by the Faculty of Arts.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThe PI has received 2 TB in OneDrive Storage and she can request up to 5TB storage (free of\ncharge). That will suffice for the amount of data to be stored.\n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nCosts for data storage and back up are covered by KU Leuven, Faculty of Arts.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nTo access the personal KU Leuven OneDrive account Multi Factor Authentication is requested.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nThe PI, Amélie Jaques, will determine in consultation with staff of the KU Leuven Libraries\nwhich data will be stored at the KU Leuven Archive Storage. In principle, all data will be retained.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nThe data will be stored at the KU Leuven Archive Storage for the required number of years\naccording to the KU Leuven regulations (at least 10 years).\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nThere will be an annual fee of approximately 75 euro. The cost will be covered with the project's\nbench fee.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nYes. Specify:\nPotential copyright restrictions will be taken into account, as indicated above.\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 5\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nIn principal, all data that does not fall under copyright restrictions will be made available after the\nend of the project.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn a restricted access repository\nUpon request by mail\nAll data will be stored at the KU Leuven Archive Storage after the end of the project. The data will\nalso be available upon request by e-mail. If shared by e-mail (or if necessary, through file sharing\nservices, such as WeTransfer), data will always be accompanied by a separate document\ndescribing the data gathering process (in a .txt file) to ensure intelligibility.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nImmediately after the end of the project\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nUpon request (explaining the planned reuse), everyone will have access to the data that does not\nfall under copyright restrictions. Only uses for research purposes will be allowed. In case data will\nbe used for future research projects, the name of the PI (Amélie Jaques) and the supervisor\n(Beatrijs Vanacker), as the sources of the data, must be mentioned.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nNo costs are expected for data sharing.\n8.
