This project will construct\na novel and unique database including firm level measures of both robotics and ICT. By doing so, the project will \ncontribute\nto the ongoing debate in three different ways. First, we will look at the firm level origins of aggregate employment\nchanges, specifically making a distinction between firms that have been adopting new technologies such as ICT and\nrobotics. Second, we look at the firm level impact of the introduction of new technologies, contrasting the impact of ICT\nwith the impact of robotics on firm level employment. We will also be able to shed the first light on how robot adoption\nimpacts employment through outsourced inputs. Third, we will merge our firm level data on robot and ICT adoption with\nworker level data and determine the contribution of these technologies on the fortunes of individual workers.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
