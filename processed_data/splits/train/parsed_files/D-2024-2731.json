This file will be located in\nthe top level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used.\nThis will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future\nreuse.\n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nAll digital data: will be stored on KU Leuven servers (L-drive), with regular on-site backup and mirroring, or stored on a cloud-\nbased service offered by KU Leuven (OneDrive). \nAll samples will be stored as appropriate: -80°C for nucleic acids, and protein samples,\nwill be stored with appropriate backup copies of the stock in the Prof. De Stroopers lab at KU Leuven. Vectors: As a general rule\nat least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C\nfreezer). One copy will be submitted to the lab plasmid database system.\nAll published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will take care\nof vector storage and shipping upon request. Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in\ncryovials as appropriate.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nKU Leuven drives are backed up according to the following scheme:\n- data stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the\nprevious version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept.\n- data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and\nSunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept.\nData on OneDrive is synced approximately every 10 minutes.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThere is sufficient storage and back-up capacity on all KU Leuven servers:\n- the “L-drive” is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster with NetApp eseries storage\nsystems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front-end.\n- the “J-drive” is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controlers with an Ontap 9.1P9 operating system.\nOnedrive provides 1TB of storage data which should be sufficient for the data generated in the project.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nBoth the “L-drive” and “J-drive” servers are accessible only by laboratory members and are mirrored in the second ICTS\ndatacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour.\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 02 April 2024\n5 of 9\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nThe costs of digital data storage are 173.78€/TB/Year for the “L-drive”. The total estimated cost of data storage of 1-2TB data\nduring the 4-year project is maximally (174€/TB/Year * 2TB * 4years =) 1392€. These costs will be met partially by the benchfee\nprovided by the FWO and partially by existing lab grants.\nMaintaining a mouse colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), excluding the costs of genotyping. When no\nexperiment is planned with a particular mouse strain, and in compliance with the 3R’s rule\n(https://www.nc3rs.org.uk), cryopreservation will thus be used to safeguard the strain, prevent genetic drift, loss of transgene, and\npotential infections or breeding problems. Cryopreservation of sperm/embryos costs about 500 to 700 euro per genotype, plus a\nminimal annual storage fee (25 euros per strain for 250 to 500 embryos). Frozen specimen are kept in two separate liquid\nnitrogen tanks at two different sites on campus. When necessary, the costs of revitalization from cryopreserved sperm/embryos\nare about 1,100/600 euro.\nElectricity costs for the -80° freezers and physical data storage are included in the general lab costs.\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are\napplicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g.\nlegal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\nThe minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets.\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nAs a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing\nplatforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of\npublication.\nFor all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows:\nDigital datasets: files will be stored on the “L-drive”.\nTissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory.\nVectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both in the form of\npurified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock (-80°C).\nCell lines: cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory (-80°C).\nGenetically modified organisms: lines that are not actively used for experiments will be cryopreserved.\nOther biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be\ncovered?\nThe total estimated cost of data storage during the 5 years after the end of the project is about 4500€ (for 5 TB). This estimation is\nbased on the different costs described before.\n5. Data sharing and reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  In the comment section please\nexplain per dataset or data type which data will be made available.\nYes, in an Open Access repository\nWe are committed to publishing research results to communicate them to peers and a wide audience. All research outputs\nsupporting publications will be made openly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to\npublication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new collaborators, or publicly via repositories\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 02 April 2024\n6 of 9\n(e.g. negative data).\nBiological material will be distributed to other parties if requested.\nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.\nWhenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available\nthrough repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain sufficient information to support\ndata interpretation and reuse and will conform to community norms. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use\n(typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication or an ODC Public Domain\nDedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access\ndata directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. For data shared directly by\nthe PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in\norder to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted.\nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd\nparty, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nNo\nWhere will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.\nAs a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing\n(www.fairsharing.org). Sharing policies for specific research outputs are detailed below:\nVectors: Upon publication, all vectors supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via the non-profit plasmid\nrepository Addgene, along with the corresponding DNA sequences. Addgene in turn performs quality control on the DNA,\ncurates the plasmids online with all relevant information (maps, sequences), and for a minimal cost ships the vectors upon\nsimple request and signature of a material transfer agreement.\nThe MTA will be prepared before depositing the vectors with the help of our organization’s Tech Transfer office. For transfer\nbetween nonprofit or academic institutions, Addgene typically uses the Uniform Biological Material Transfer\nAgreement (https://www.addgene.org/terms/1047/). All non-published vectors and the associated documentation will be\nshared by the PI upon request and after signature of a material transfer agreement, at no cost except the cost of shipment.\nCell lines: All human pluripotent cell lines supporting publications will be registered in hPSCreg, the European human\nembryonic stem cell registry supported by the European Commission (https://hpscreg.eu/). Information about the deposited\nlines (including donor information, derivation method, availability, and characterization) will also be made accessible.\nRegistration of cell lines in hPSCreg will provide visibility, confirm ethical procurement, and facilitate comparison with other\nhPSC lines. The PI will remain the distributor of the pluripotent cell lines.\nAll other cell lines supporting publications will be deposited in the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) database\n(https://www.atcc.org/), which is a private, non-profit biological resource center. This will provide a secure backup for this material.\nInvestigators can purchase cell lines from the ATCC database upon signature of a material transfer agreement\n(https://www.lgcstandards-atcc.org/~/media/PDFs/MTA_2.ashx) and, in some cases, of a Limited Use/Label License (e.g. for\nCRISPR products or iPSC materials) and/or a Customer Acceptance of Responsibility (for potentially highly pathogenic\nmaterials). Information about the cell lines (including organism, cell type, tissue, biosafety level, and disease if applicable) will\nalso be made accessible.\nGenetically modified organisms: All genetically modified organisms used in publications will be made available to researchers\nupon request at the time of publication.\nAntibodies, synthetic and recombinant compounds: samples will be stored as appropriate in the laboratory. Within\navailability, they will be shared with interested researchers upon request.\nResearch documentation: All protocols used to generate published data will be described in the corresponding manuscript(s),\nand the related documentation will be included as supplementary information. These data and all other documents (daily\nlogs, raw data) deposited in the E-Notebook are accessible to the PI and the research staff and will be made available upon\nrequest.\nManuscripts: All scientific publications will be shared openly. Manuscripts submitted for publication will be deposited in a pre-\nprint server such as bioRxiv, arXiv, Nature Precedings, or ASAPbio). At the time of publication, research results will be\nsummarized on the PI’s website (add website address) and post-print pdf versions of publications will be made available\nthere if allowed by copyright agreements, possibly after an embargo as determined by the publisher. Before the end of the\nembargo or in cases where sharing the post-print is not allowed due to copyright agreements, a pre-print version of the\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 02 April 2024\n7 of 9\nmanuscript will be made available. Publications will also be automatically added to our institutional repository, Lirias 2.0,\nbased on the author's name and ORCID ID.\nNucleic acid and protein sequences: All nucleic acid and protein sequences generated during the project will be stored on\nKU Leuven servers. Upon publication, all sequences supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via repositories\nsuch as the GenBank database or the European Nucleotide Archive (nucleotide sequences from primers / new genes / new\ngenomes), NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (microarray data / RNA-seq data / CHIPseq data), the Protein Database (for\nprotein sequences).\nData that do not support publication will be either deposited in an open-access repository or made available upon request by\nemail.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nThe data will be made available as a pre-print when submitting the manuscript and as a post-print upon publication. No embargo\nwill be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, or potential IP requirements. In those cases, datasets will be made\npublicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached.\nWhich data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why.\nThe provided data usage license will depend on the journal/repository in which the project will be published. This is the standard\ncreative commons license is CC-BY.\nDo you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide\nit in the comment section.\nYes\nA permanent identifier is added to the data upon deposit in a repository. \nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nIt is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file\nstorage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities\nwhenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget.\n6. Responsibilities\nWho will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project?\nMetadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful\nnotes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook) that refer to specific datasets. \nWho will manage data storage and backup during the research project?\nThe research and technical staff will ensure data storage and back up, with support from René Custers and Alexander Botzki for\nthe electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) and from Raf De Coster for the KU Leuven drives. \nWho will manage data preservation and sharing?\nThe PI is responsible for data preservation and sharing, with support from the research and technical staff involved in the project,\nfrom René Custers and Alexander Botzki for the electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) and from Raf De Coster for the KU Leuven\ndrives. \nCreated using DMPonline.be.

The following information will be stored: This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 4 of 8 Title: free text Creator: Last name, first name, organization Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 02 April 2024 4 of 9 Date and time reference Subject: Choice of keywords and classifications Description: Text explaining the content of the data set and other contextual information needed for the correct interpretation of the data, the software(s) (including version number) used to produce and to read the data, the purpose of the experiment, etc. Format: Details of the file format, Resource Type: data set, image, audio, etc. Identifier: DOI (when applicable) Access rights: closed access, embargoed access, restricted access, open access. The final dataset will be accompanied by this information under the form of a README.txt document. This file will be located in the top level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used. This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? All digital data: will be stored on KU Leuven servers (L-drive), with regular on-site backup and mirroring, or stored on a cloud- based service offered by KU Leuven (OneDrive). All samples will be stored as appropriate: -80°C for nucleic acids, and protein samples, will be stored with appropriate backup copies of the stock in the Prof. De Stroopers lab at KU Leuven. Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer). One copy will be submitted to the lab plasmid database system. All published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request. Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate. How will the data be backed up? KU Leuven drives are backed up according to the following scheme: - data stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept. - data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept. Data on OneDrive is synced approximately every 10 minutes. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes There is sufficient storage and back-up capacity on all KU Leuven servers: - the “L-drive” is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster with NetApp eseries storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front-end. - the “J-drive” is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controlers with an Ontap 9.1P9 operating system. Onedrive provides 1TB of storage data which should be sufficient for the data generated in the project. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Both the “L-drive” and “J-drive” servers are accessible only by laboratory members and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 02 April 2024 5 of 9 What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The costs of digital data storage are 173.78€/TB/Year for the “L-drive”. The total estimated cost of data storage of 1-2TB data during the 4-year project is maximally (174€/TB/Year * 2TB * 4years =) 1392€. These costs will be met partially by the benchfee provided by the FWO and partially by existing lab grants. Maintaining a mouse colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), excluding the costs of genotyping. When no experiment is planned with a particular mouse strain, and in compliance with the 3R’s rule (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk), cryopreservation will thus be used to safeguard the strain, prevent genetic drift, loss of transgene, and potential infections or breeding problems. Cryopreservation of sperm/embryos costs about 500 to 700 euro per genotype, plus a minimal annual storage fee (25 euros per strain for 250 to 500 embryos). Frozen specimen are kept in two separate liquid nitrogen tanks at two different sites on campus. When necessary, the costs of revitalization from cryopreserved sperm/embryos are about 1,100/600 euro. Electricity costs for the -80° freezers and physical data storage are included in the general lab costs. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). The minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of publication. For all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows: Digital datasets: files will be stored on the “L-drive”. Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory. Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both in the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock (-80°C). Cell lines: cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory (-80°C). Genetically modified organisms: lines that are not actively used for experiments will be cryopreserved. Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The total estimated cost of data storage during the 5 years after the end of the project is about 4500€ (for 5 TB). This estimation is based on the different costs described before. 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in an Open Access repository We are committed to publishing research results to communicate them to peers and a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made openly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new collaborators, or publicly via repositories Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 02 April 2024 6 of 9 (e.g. negative data). Biological material will be distributed to other parties if requested. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse and will conform to community norms. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication or an ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. No Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org). Sharing policies for specific research outputs are detailed below: Vectors: Upon publication, all vectors supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, along with the corresponding DNA sequences. Addgene in turn performs quality control on the DNA, curates the plasmids online with all relevant information (maps, sequences), and for a minimal cost ships the vectors upon simple request and signature of a material transfer agreement. The MTA will be prepared before depositing the vectors with the help of our organization’s Tech Transfer office. For transfer between nonprofit or academic institutions, Addgene typically uses the Uniform Biological Material Transfer Agreement (https://www.addgene.org/terms/1047/). All non-published vectors and the associated documentation will be shared by the PI upon request and after signature of a material transfer agreement, at no cost except the cost of shipment. Cell lines: All human pluripotent cell lines supporting publications will be registered in hPSCreg, the European human embryonic stem cell registry supported by the European Commission (https://hpscreg.eu/). Information about the deposited lines (including donor information, derivation method, availability, and characterization) will also be made accessible. Registration of cell lines in hPSCreg will provide visibility, confirm ethical procurement, and facilitate comparison with other hPSC lines. The PI will remain the distributor of the pluripotent cell lines. All other cell lines supporting publications will be deposited in the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) database (https://www.atcc.org/), which is a private, non-profit biological resource center. This will provide a secure backup for this material. Investigators can purchase cell lines from the ATCC database upon signature of a material transfer agreement (https://www.lgcstandards-atcc.org/~/media/PDFs/MTA_2.ashx) and, in some cases, of a Limited Use/Label License (e.g. for CRISPR products or iPSC materials) and/or a Customer Acceptance of Responsibility (for potentially highly pathogenic materials). Information about the cell lines (including organism, cell type, tissue, biosafety level, and disease if applicable) will also be made accessible. Genetically modified organisms: All genetically modified organisms used in publications will be made available to researchers upon request at the time of publication. Antibodies, synthetic and recombinant compounds: samples will be stored as appropriate in the laboratory. Within availability, they will be shared with interested researchers upon request. Research documentation: All protocols used to generate published data will be described in the corresponding manuscript(s), and the related documentation will be included as supplementary information. These data and all other documents (daily logs, raw data) deposited in the E-Notebook are accessible to the PI and the research staff and will be made available upon request. Manuscripts: All scientific publications will be shared openly. Manuscripts submitted for publication will be deposited in a pre- print server such as bioRxiv, arXiv, Nature Precedings, or ASAPbio). At the time of publication, research results will be summarized on the PI’s website (add website address) and post-print pdf versions of publications will be made available there if allowed by copyright agreements, possibly after an embargo as determined by the publisher. Before the end of the embargo or in cases where sharing the post-print is not allowed due to copyright agreements, a pre-print version of the Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 02 April 2024 7 of 9 manuscript will be made available. Publications will also be automatically added to our institutional repository, Lirias 2.0, based on the author's name and ORCID ID. Nucleic acid and protein sequences: All nucleic acid and protein sequences generated during the project will be stored on KU Leuven servers. Upon publication, all sequences supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via repositories such as the GenBank database or the European Nucleotide Archive (nucleotide sequences from primers / new genes / new genomes), NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (microarray data / RNA-seq data / CHIPseq data), the Protein Database (for protein sequences). Data that do not support publication will be either deposited in an open-access repository or made available upon request by email. When will the data be made available? The data will be made available as a pre-print when submitting the manuscript and as a post-print upon publication. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, or potential IP requirements. In those cases, datasets will be made publicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. The provided data usage license will depend on the journal/repository in which the project will be published. This is the standard creative commons license is CC-BY. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. Yes A permanent identifier is added to the data upon deposit in a repository. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. 6. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project? Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook) that refer to specific datasets. Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project? The research and technical staff will ensure data storage and back up, with support from René Custers and Alexander Botzki for the electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) and from Raf De Coster for the KU Leuven drives. Who will manage data preservation and sharing? The PI is responsible for data preservation and sharing, with support from the research and technical staff involved in the project, from René Custers and Alexander Botzki for the electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) and from Raf De Coster for the KU Leuven drives.
