Meanwhile, antibiotic resistance\ndevelopment is ever increasing. A specific form of antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria benefit from the properties of competitors in\ntheir environment to obtain resistance. This type of resistance is less frequently studied and the underlying mechanisms are often\nneglected. Therefore, a better understanding of polybacterial antibiotic responses in the\nhuman gut is required to develop antibiotic treatments that are better tailored to the real environment of the target pathogens. This project\naims to obtain insight into the interactions in the\nkinetics of antibiotic responses between food pathogens and gut microbiota by using a combined experimental and modelling approach.\nThis objective will be achieved through three work packages (WP) in which mathematical models are constructed to obtain insight into\nthese interactions. In the first WP, the individual antibiotic responses of monocultures will be modelled. These models will be extended in\nthe second WP by including pairwise interactions between strains. The final WP will investigate the impact of increased antibiotic\nresistance of a strain on these pairwise interactions. The project results will contribute to understanding resistance mechanisms and\ntherefore to better develop antibiotic strategies.\nLast modified: \n17-04-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
