In tumors, these cells transition from \"effector\" to \"exhausted\" T cells. Effector T cells are able to recognize and kill cancer cells, but exhausted T cells lose this anti-cancer function. Interestingly, an increase in the number of exhausted T cells is linked to cancer progression and resistance to treatment. Recent studies have shown that cellular metabolism plays a significant role in regulating the process of T cell exhaustion. Indeed, the availability of nutrients in the tumor can affect T cell differentiation and promote cancer progression. Although many metabolic targets responsible for T cell exhaustion have been identified, the metabolic differences between primary tumors and metastatic tissues make it challenging to prevent or reverse the process of exhaustion in metastases. In this project, we aim to investigate how the nutrient microenvironment of melanoma metastasis impacts T cell exhaustion. Our preliminary data suggest that a metabolic program involving the TCA cycle is involved. We will explore the relevance of this pathway in T cell exhaustion in lung and liver metastasis. Finally, we will validate our findings in mouse models and patient data sets. Our goal is to develop new strategies to prevent or reverse T cell exhaustion and improve the efficacy of immunotherapy for the treatment of metastatic cancer. Institution KU Leuven  1.

Data description 2.1. Will you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?   Generate new data  2.2. What data will you collect, generate or reuse? Describe the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a numbered list or table and per objective of the project.  We will generate new experimental data, more specifically biochemistry, flow-cytometry, cell physiology, immunochemistry data, and mouse data. We will also modulate T cell function by using genetic and pharmacological approaches. These approaches will be evaluated by western blot, RTqPCR, ELISA, proteomics data, seahorse data and flow cytometry data (.xls, .czi,.csv, .tiff, .jpeg, .fcs). Additionally, we will also measure metabolite content using mass spectrometry (.D, .CDF). All data will be generated in the host institution. When a researcher starts at KU Leuven he/she will have to sign an agreement in which he/she agrees to maintain written or digital records of all collected results (hard copy of electronic notebooks). All raw data will be stored on the university server. Furthermore, these data will generate manuscripts for \npublication in peer-reviewed journals. All necessary measures will be taken to archive all biological material according to good scientific practices. The estimated volume of data is 5TB.

Ethical and legal issues 3.1. Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add the reference to the file in KU Leuven's Record of Processing Activities. Be aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.  No  3.2. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant ethical review committee(s).  Yes.  All experiments on mice are conducted according to institutional, national and European animal regulations. The lab already has ethical clearance files approved by the animal ethics committee at the KU Leuven (P054/2022).  3.3. Does your research possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted?  No  No third-party agreement restricts dissemination or exploitation of the data from this project.  4. Documentation and metadata 4.1. What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of the data collected/generated in this project?  Documentation and metadata associated with the different experiments will be meticulously described in electronic notebooks. The researcher will outline all different steps including experimental setup, protocol, method of data collection, employed controls, and analysis. 4.2. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used. If not, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse.  At the moment, the lab does not make use of a standard metadata.
