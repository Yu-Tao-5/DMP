WDs play a unique and fundamental role in our understanding of\nthe formation and evolution of stars and planetary systems. An important\nsubset of WDs presents photometric variability caused by a range of\nphenomena, including pulsations, binarity, and more recently transits by both\nplanets and planetary debris. Therefore, studying photometric variations in\nWDs provides an invaluable source of information concerning the end stages of\nstars and planets. This research statement focuses on identifying and\ncharacterizing two types of variable WDs: those being transited by\nplanets/circumstellar planetary debris and those that pulsate.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n22-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). For all the survey dataset will be given in cds.u-strasbg.fr with README.txt files. Such example can already be found in https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/684/A118 in the case of hotsubdwarfs. Data pertaining to hot subdwarfs and low-mass red giants will also be archived at https://a15.astro.physik.uni-potsdam.de/w/projects/. For data concerning white dwarfs, upon submission, it will be accessible to the public via https://www.montrealwhitedwarfdatabase.org/. Created using DMPonline.be.

Yes A significant volume of data in the standard FITS format will be handled, encompassing photometric data sourced from missions such as Kepler/K2, TESS, and PLATO, alongside astrometric data from Gaia. Throughout the study, these datasets will be subjected to post- processing, resulting in the preservation of associated output files, which may manifest as .png images for visual representations and spectra, or .csv files for tabular data. All the dataset can be found in https://a15.astro.physik.uni-potsdam.de/w/projects/ and cds.u-strasbg.fr. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? The Institute of Astronomy has an effective internal backup and storage mechanism that will enable ongoing data preservation. The publications describing the complete scientific method will be available from the appropriate scientific journals and KU Leuven Lirias, and additional astronomical models and model output will be stored on CDS database (cds.u-strasbg.fr) when applicable. In addition, all original astronomical observations and metadata are stored on public data repositories of the observatories. Any relevant codes will be made GitHub- accessible such as https://github.com/muratuzundag. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? The IT staff will conduct routine backups. Nevertheless, we suggest a series of strategies for ensuring data reproducibility in observed dataset and model simulations. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes The primary storage & backup capacity is around 3 TB. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? All data and model source codes will adhere to IT guidelines, ensuring that all computers and external drives are password protected. The IT staff consistently performs security upgrades. When sharing datasets, read-only permissions will be enforced. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? We anticipate no supplementary expenses for data storage or backup, as the operational costs of the IT department are covered by the co-host institute, the KU Leuven. 4.

Processed Data: Processed datasets, including cleaned and analyzed data, as well as intermediate data generated during data processing pipelines, will be retained. Documentation: Comprehensive documentation, including project plans, data dictionaries, codebooks, and metadata, will be explained on the manuscript that uploaded in Lirias. Model Codes: Source code and algorithms used for data analysis and modeling will be preserved in mostly GitHub and Lirias to ensure reproducibility of results. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Major part of these data will be stored on the CDS database (cds.u-strasbg.fr) repository. If needed, non-published results can be stored at an internal workstation as well.
