Yet many healthcare applications have data characteristics that make it difficult to apply\nstandard machine learning methods. For example, patient outcomes can often be expressed in different ways and are difficult to summarize in one\nvalue. This requires the application of so-called structured output learning methods. Such methods are not yet widely used in practice, because it is\noften difficult to find an exact mapping from the applications to the methods currently available in the literature. In this project we want to fill this gap\nby contributing to the structured output learning domain. More precisely, we will design novel multi-task learning, multi-instance learning and label\nranking algorithms. Our algorithmic contributions are motivated by two concrete clinical applications, concerning paediatric intensive care unit\npatients and infertile couples. We will be working with real data from these applications. On the longer term, our methods will assist clinicians in\nproviding personalised and preventive healthcare.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n25-06-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

All generated data will be retained for minimum 10 years (KU Leuven RDM policy). The preservation of the reused patient data falls under the responsibility of the UZ Leuven teams. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? The generated software data will be archived on KU Leuven's K drive, which is a drive specifically for archiving. It may also be made available, e.g. on a GitHub repository.

What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The expected costs for preservation are negligible and will be covered by the budget of our research group. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 25 June 2024 5 of 7 5. Data sharing and reuse 5.
