The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal.

But only a subset of patients derives clinical benefits, and \nthere is currently no definitive explanation of the cellular and molecular basis of this heterogeneity in \nresponse. The functional inter-regulation of tumour angiogenesis and immunosuppression has provided \nthe rationale to combine immunotherapy with antiangiogenic therapy in the form of antiangiogenic \nimmunotherapy combinations. This has provided superior beneficial effects in several upcoming preclinical  \ntrials and have already been translated into clinical trials in several solid tumours like HCC, RCC and TNBC.  \nAs several antiangiogenic immunotherapy combinations are currently being tested in several tumour \ntypes, it is very timely to identify the “second-wave” relapse mechanisms (relapse following antiangiogenic  \nimmunotherapy combination treatments). Taking advantage of a unique transgenic cancer mouse model \nthat exhibits response and relapse phases during antiangiogenic immunotherapies, I will conduct single \ncell expression profiling and functional analyses of the tumour microenvironmental landscape, to decipher  \nthe molecular mechanisms of response and acquired resistance that affect the innate and adaptive \nimmune systems. Our preliminary data show activation of distinct intratumoural myeloid cell-derived \nimmunosuppressive pathways and a parallel activation of immune checkpoint molecules in T cells. We \nspeculate that targeting these distinct and specific immunosuppressive axes will sensitise tumours to the \nadministered antiangiogenic immunotherapies, creating effective transformative immune-oncology \ntreatment modalities for cancer.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Back-up costs of 1 TB (KU Leuven ICTS) 104.42 euros/year. The lab budget will cover storage and back-up costs. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All generated data will be retained for at least 5 years after the end of the project. For publication purposes, our data will be publicly available on data repositories and published articles that have an open access status. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?Data will be stored on the archive K-drive, which is also managed by the ICTS KU Leuven department . FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Yearly storage costs of 1TB data on the K-drive: 56,92 euros. Costs will be covered by internal lab funding. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 136. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY.
