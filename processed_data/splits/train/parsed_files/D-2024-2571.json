The selected application for the studied SPZ is the CO2 to olefins.\nSo far, an FT-IR cell to allow studying the catalysts has been successfully installed by optimizing some of the parameters of the existing IR tool \n(high sensitivity detector, addition of a line allowing the use of liquid probe molecules). A series of SPZ (CHA with Si/Al = 40 and AEI with Si/Al =  \n15-25) were prepared and tested in the FT-IR setup, where the adsorption of methanol (our first benchmark probe) was performed.  \nThe activity of these zeolites was tested in the CO2-to-olefins in a parallel research project (colleagues from the Dusselier lab) and a \ncomparison between the adsorption affinity of methanol and the reactivity of this latter were made. The steaming of the tested zeolites was \nalso performed under several temperatures (650, 700, and 750°C  giving a total of 9 new materials) and the new obtained materials were \nalso measured with methanol adsorption and progressive thermal desorption measurements. The evolution of the surface acidity was \nfollowed with the analysis of the OH zone (3800-3200 cm-1) in the FT-IR spectra to reveal the effect of the steaming and depict the formation of  \nnew acidic sites on the surface.  \nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 6Will you process personal data6? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. If available, add the reference to your file in your host institution's privacy register.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes: -Short description of the kind of personal data that will be used: -Privacy Registry Reference: Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin- offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please comment: Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 6 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 73.Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded).The collected data will be organized in a set of themed documents and folders. A README.txt file explaining the characteristics of the measurements will be available in each of the folders where these documents are stored. The titles of the files and documents will be labelled using a consistent code that can express the content of the file (codes are defined between me and my promotor); this will ensure the understandability and usability of the data by my colleagues. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 8Where will the data be stored? The primary storage location for the data will be the researcher’s personal laptop computer managed by SET-IT (local KU Leuven IT department). This pc is backed up via KU Leuven on a Personal Network Drive. A shared one-drive folder between me and my promotor will be used to store the data with automatic updates that will ensure their direct availability. The physical powder samples will be labelled and stored on a personal shelf in a laboratory cabinet meant for powder samples and will be accessible by the researcher and the promotor. An Excel sheet containing the description of the powder samples will be created and filled constantly and stored on the Shared one-drive folder. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.Project data will be backed up to the Personal KU Leuven Network Drive account. Data will also be backed up on the researcher’s personal external hard-drive on a monthly basis. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: I estimated the data from this project to not exceed the 50 Gb . If no, please specify: 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7My personal laptop (where the data are first stored) is password and fingerprint-protected, which will help prevent the data from being misused. The external hard drive will be kept in a secure location in the office of my promotor. The KU Leuven OneDrive account is also password-protected and can be only accessed via KU Leuven Authenticator. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?No additional costs are required for data storage for this project. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All the stored data will be retained for at least 5 years after the research period. The data that are made available on the KU Leuven repository (RDR) will be preserved for at least 10 years. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?Beyond the minimal storage period, the promotor can decide whether the retained data are worth keeping or not. Data referring to publications or ongoing projects are always maintained on the external drive and delivered to the newcomers. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?The costs for buying an external drive has been already paid, no additional costs are needed. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 116. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☐ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.The KU Leuven institutional repository (RDR) can be used for data sharing. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.Upon publication of research results, or by the end of the research period (whichever happens sooner). Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 Data from the project that can be shared will be made available under a Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY 4.0), so that users have to give credit to the original data creators (the researcher). Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes: Not yet available, but a published dataset in KU Leuven RDR gets its own DOI and is registered in Lirias. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Costs for sharing the data during the retention period will be covered by the researcher’s FWO bench fee. 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 137.
