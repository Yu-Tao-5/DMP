FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type. -Peer-reviewed and grey literature -Clinical trial databases, such as EudraCT (EU Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials; https://eudract.ema.europa.eu), ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP (International Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the World Health Organization; https://www.who.int/clinical-trials-registry-platform), Catapult clinical trials database (https://ct.catapult.org.uk/resources/clinical-trials-database), American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy database (https://asgct.org/), and the Gene Therapy Clinical Trials Worldwide database (https://www.genetherapynet.com/clinical-trials.html) Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, please describe these issues further and refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate.☐ Yes, human subject data ☐ Yes, animal data ☐ Yes, dual use ☒ No This project does not carry out experiments on humans, but elicits the opinion of different stakeholders (such as health care payers, health technology assessment bodies, pharmaceutical companies, academics and patient organisations) about sustainable market access to advanced therapies. For those studies involving these stakeholders, an application will be submitted to the research ethics committee of KU Leuven. If yes, please describe: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10Will you process personal data6? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use.

For each study, a separate folder (and sub-folders, if relevant) will be created that includes such files as the study protocol, information letter, invitation to participate in the study, informed consent form, reporting template and data collection form, interview/expert panel guide, ethical approval document, audio and Nvivo files, relevant published scientific articles, endnote files. For each study, a README.txt file will be created including general information, project information, file overview and storage information. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: No metadata will be created. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 124.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? The time-stamped master copy of the data will be kept on our research unit central storage facility. Copies can be made and kept on personal devices. Since the project team involves members from different institutions, we will use Sharepoint to facilitate collaboration and information exchange. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.The data will be backed up on the university's central servers. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: Sufficient storage capacity is available on our research unit central storage facility, on Sharepoint, and on the university's central servers. If no, please specify: 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7Data can be accessed by project team members only and are stored on platforms to which unauthorized persons don't have access. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?There are no additional expected costs for data storage and back up related to the project. If such costs would be incurred, they will be covered by the FWO allocated project budget. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All data will be retained for at least ten years after the end of the project. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?The data will be archived on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?There are no additional expected costs for data preservation related to the project.

If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 Not applicable Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.Not applicable What are the expected costs for data sharing?
