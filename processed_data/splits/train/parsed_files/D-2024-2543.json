In this project, we will use deep learning models and enhancer-based gene regulatory network\ninference to model enhancers and link them to target genes, applied to human substantia nigra (SN) and cingulate gyrus (CG) brain regions. Next, we\nwill leverage the availability of fully phased whole genome sequences for a cohort of donors to statistically test the effects of genetic variation on\nchromatin accessibility and gene expression in different cell types of CG and SN. These results will be then integrated to prioritize variants with\npotential effects on gene regulation in the human brain, with subsequent experimental validation of a subset of selected enhancer variants.. \nTo our knowledge, a combined framework that integrates statistical QTL mapping, allelic imbalance,  deep learning, and GRN inference has not yet\nbeen applied to any human tissue, at the scale of our proposal. This unique data resource along with the novel computational strategies, will allow us to\nstudy gene regulation in the human brain at unprecedented resolution, and with a direct application to a complex disease. This approach should\nsignificantly improve our understanding of the functional effects of non-coding genetic variation and could lead to improved polygenic risk scores for\nParkinson’s disease.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n03-05-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nWhere will the data be stored?\nDigital data\nDigital data\nPrimary storage for active digital files is on KU Leuven servers. KU Leuven offers fast (\"J-drive) and slower (\"L-drive\") storage that allows\nreading/writing/modification of non-confidential, confidential, and strictly confidential data. KU Leuven further offers the ManGO platform for\nstorage and management of large volumes of active research data. This platform allows secure storage, manual and automated metadata\ncoupling, data workflows, and file sharing.\nAlgorithms, scripts and software: All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software code will be stored on the lab GitHub account\n(https://github.com/aertslab).\nOmics data: omics data generated during the project will be stored on KU Leuven servers or on the ManGO platform. Upon publication,\nall sequences supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via repositories  such as:\nASAP collaborative network cloud platform \nEGA (WGS, snRNA, snATAC)\nPersonal data of human subjects will be stored on a dedicated KU Leuven secure server (Digital vault). \nUpon publication, all sequences supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via repositories  such as the GenBank database\nor the European Nucleotide Archive (nucleotide sequences from primers / new genes / new genomes), NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus\n(microarray data / RNA-seq data / CHIPseq data), the Protein Database (for protein sequences), or the EBI European Genome-phenome\nArchive (for human (epi)genome and transcriptome sequences).\nPhysical samples \nPhysical samples \nTissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory. \nVectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified\nDNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacterial glycerol stock (-80°C). All published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the\nnon-profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request. \nCell lines: Newly created human cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid nitrogen storage and will be deposited in the\nUZ Leuven-KU Leuven Biobank. Other human cell lines will be stored locally in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory when\nactively used for experiments. Animal cell lines will be stored in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nHow will the data be backed up?\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Data in these drives are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business\ncontinuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour.\nAccess to the digital vault is possible only through using a KU Leuven user-id and password, and user rights only grant access to the data in\ntheir own vault. Sensitive data transfer will be performed according to the best practices for “Copying data to the secure environment” defined\nby KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of upgrades and security patches.\nThe server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound by the ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root\nrights. A security service monitors the technical installations continuously, even outside working hours. Only the PI and medical team\nmembers will be granted access to the server to deposit private data. The PI and medical team members will be the only responsible for linking\npatient information and/or samples, and will strictly respect confidentiality. \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\n-The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 569,2€/5TB/Year for the “L-drive”, 519€/TB/Year for the “J-drive”, and 35€/TB/Year for the\nManGO platform. Data storage and backup costs are included in general lab costs.\n-Maintaining a mouse colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), excluding the costs of genotyping. When no experiment is\nplanned with a particular mouse strain, and in compliance with the 3R’s rule (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk), cryopreservation will thus be used to\nsafeguard the strain, prevent genetic drift, loss of transgene and potential infections or breeding problems. Cryopreservation of sperm/embryos\ncosts about 500 to 700 euro per genotype, plus a minimal annual storage fee (25 euro per strain for 250 to 500 embryos). Frozen specimen are\nkept in two separate liquid nitrogen tanks at two different sites on campus. When necessary, the costs of revitalization from cryopreserved\nsperm/embryos are about 1,100/600 euro.\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\n4.

In this project, we will use deep learning models and enhancer-based gene regulatory network inference to model enhancers and link them to target genes, applied to human substantia nigra (SN) and cingulate gyrus (CG) brain regions. Next, we will leverage the availability of fully phased whole genome sequences for a cohort of donors to statistically test the effects of genetic variation on chromatin accessibility and gene expression in different cell types of CG and SN. These results will be then integrated to prioritize variants with potential effects on gene regulation in the human brain, with subsequent experimental validation of a subset of selected enhancer variants.. To our knowledge, a combined framework that integrates statistical QTL mapping, allelic imbalance, deep learning, and GRN inference has not yet been applied to any human tissue, at the scale of our proposal. This unique data resource along with the novel computational strategies, will allow us to study gene regulation in the human brain at unprecedented resolution, and with a direct application to a complex disease. This approach should significantly improve our understanding of the functional effects of non-coding genetic variation and could lead to improved polygenic risk scores for Parkinson’s disease.

Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Digital data Digital data Primary storage for active digital files is on KU Leuven servers. KU Leuven offers fast (\"J-drive) and slower (\"L-drive\") storage that allows reading/writing/modification of non-confidential, confidential, and strictly confidential data. KU Leuven further offers the ManGO platform for storage and management of large volumes of active research data. This platform allows secure storage, manual and automated metadata coupling, data workflows, and file sharing. Algorithms, scripts and software: All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software code will be stored on the lab GitHub account (https://github.com/aertslab). Omics data: omics data generated during the project will be stored on KU Leuven servers or on the ManGO platform. Upon publication, all sequences supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via repositories such as: ASAP collaborative network cloud platform EGA (WGS, snRNA, snATAC) Personal data of human subjects will be stored on a dedicated KU Leuven secure server (Digital vault). Upon publication, all sequences supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via repositories such as the GenBank database or the European Nucleotide Archive (nucleotide sequences from primers / new genes / new genomes), NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (microarray data / RNA-seq data / CHIPseq data), the Protein Database (for protein sequences), or the EBI European Genome-phenome Archive (for human (epi)genome and transcriptome sequences). Physical samples Physical samples Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory. Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacterial glycerol stock (-80°C). All published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request. Cell lines: Newly created human cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid nitrogen storage and will be deposited in the UZ Leuven-KU Leuven Biobank. Other human cell lines will be stored locally in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory when actively used for experiments. Animal cell lines will be stored in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 03 May 2024 10 of 14 KU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme: data stored in manGO: Snapshots are made at regular intervals (hourly, daily and monthly) in case data needs to be recovered. The data itself is synchronized on two separate hardware storage systems, each 6 PB large, located at Leuven and at Heverlee (ICTS). The data is protected against calamities at either site by synchronizing it in real-time at hardware level. data stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept. data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept. data stored on the digital vault is backed up using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. As standard, 10% of the requested storage is reserved for backups using the following backup regime: an hourly backup (at 8 a.m., 12 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.), the last 6 of which are kept; a daily backup (every day) at midnight, the last 6 of which are kept; and a weekly backup (every week) at midnight between Saturday and Sunday, the last 2 of which are kept.

If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes KU Leuven servers offer sufficient storage for active data (J/L-drive, ManGO) and archived data (K-drive). Required data-storage volumes can be easily scaled up. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The buildings on our campus are restricted by badge system so only employees are allowed in and visitors are allowed under supervision after registration. Access to the “L-drive”, “J-drive”, and ManGO servers is possible only through using a KU Leuven user-id and password, and user rights only grant access to their own data, or data that was shared to them. Data in these drives are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. Access to the digital vault is possible only through using a KU Leuven user-id and password, and user rights only grant access to the data in their own vault. Sensitive data transfer will be performed according to the best practices for “Copying data to the secure environment” defined by KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of upgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound by the ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. A security service monitors the technical installations continuously, even outside working hours. Only the PI and medical team members will be granted access to the server to deposit private data. The PI and medical team members will be the only responsible for linking patient information and/or samples, and will strictly respect confidentiality.

How will these costs be covered? -The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 569,2€/5TB/Year for the “L-drive”, 519€/TB/Year for the “J-drive”, and 35€/TB/Year for the ManGO platform. Data storage and backup costs are included in general lab costs. -Maintaining a mouse colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), excluding the costs of genotyping. When no experiment is planned with a particular mouse strain, and in compliance with the 3R’s rule (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk), cryopreservation will thus be used to safeguard the strain, prevent genetic drift, loss of transgene and potential infections or breeding problems. Cryopreservation of sperm/embryos costs about 500 to 700 euro per genotype, plus a minimal annual storage fee (25 euro per strain for 250 to 500 embryos). Frozen specimen are kept in two separate liquid nitrogen tanks at two different sites on campus. When necessary, the costs of revitalization from cryopreserved sperm/embryos are about 1,100/600 euro. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project 4.

Yes, Privacy aspects Yes, Intellectual Property Rights Human omics data are considered sensitive personal data, and are are only made available on restricted access repositories such as the European Genome Phenome Archive (EGA). Access to these datasets is under control of a Data Access Committee. The researchers involved and the IP team of the VIB TechTransfer Office shall make the necessary arrangements in order to maintain an embargo on the public access of research data, at least until the essential steps in securing intellectual property (e.g. the filing of a patent application) have been taken. As such the IP protection does not withhold the research data from being made public. In the case a decision is taken to file a patent application it will be planned so that publications need not be delayed. Where will the data be made available?

What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. 6. Responsibilities 6. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project?
