Describe these issues in the comment section.\nPlease refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate.\nNo\nSMEC-PRET approval: G-2021-4001-R6(AMD)\nWill you process personal data? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate.\nYes\nFor all surveys, participants receive an anonymous link but they have the opportunity to share their email with the researchers so they can be informed about the results of the study they\nparticipated in. In the case of low response rates, the researchers may also provide an opportunity to share their email for a lottery.\nIn study 3 & 4 we will collect multiwave data, meaning that during the first wave participants can leave their emails if they wish to participate in the next waves so that we can contact them to\nparticipate again.\nAll e-mail addresses will be stored on the secure Y-drive of the Faculty of Economics and Business, KU Leuven, which is a central storage that only the primary researcher has access to. After\nthe studies, e-mail addresses will be deleted since they no longer serve us a purpose. From that point on, survey data are fully anonymized.\nFor the interviews, participants will be asked to tell about their latest recruitment experiences. In addition, we ask them about: which position they applied for and the outcome of this process.\nPrivate information, though not explicitly asked, such as income (e.g. when they talk about salary negotiations), will not be part of the analyses. The recordings will be converted to .mp3 files such\nthat no faces can be recognized, and after names and other sensitive data is bleeped away, the identity of the interviewees becomes almost fully anonymous.\nDoes your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type\nwhere appropriate.\nYes\nSurveys related to critical incident study (1): results can be used to create checklists for organizations about the factors most influential in improving or damaging the candidate experience. The\noutcomes studies (3 & 4) add to this knowledge by showing in what way these moments will affect attitudes and behavior beyond this lasting experience.\nSurveys related to the scale development (2): results are a measurement instrument for candidate experience, which can be adapted to specific organizations at different touchpoints during the\napplication process. A general scale will be published in a scientific journal, but companies who wish more context-sensitive insight could consult a spin-off agency, or the researchers can develop\na freemium model for different industries. For the latter, companies can freely access the published scale, but industry-relevant adaptations would require a fee. In addition, it is possible to turn the\nscale into a 'candidate experience dashboard' that companies can use to closely monitor their candidate experience.\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements/ research collaboration agreements)? If so,\nplease explain in the comment section to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.\nNo\nAre there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain in the comment section to\nwhat data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.\nYes\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 28 April 2023\n6 of 9\nWe will collect data in collaboration with external organizations, which currently are Crytek GmbH, Telenet, and Hudson. With these organizations, we have signed agreements that protects both\nus as them. For us this means that they can only use our scales and findings for internal use until our research related to these materials has been published. The agreements protect them such\nthat their company-sensitive insights will only be used for scientific purposes, and that results will only be shared with other organizations at an aggregated level. In the future, if more data is\nneeded or if valorization opportunities arise, other companies may join and be subject to the same agreement procedures.\n2. Documentation and Metadata\nClearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in\nthe future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is\nrecorded).\nFor all data collections, an .xlsx file (similar to a README) of the used scales and instructions is prepared by the researcher and reviewed by the supervisors of this project. These files include the\ntypologies of questions, the codes that were given to the variables in the datasets, the references of the original source of the variables and their response categories and variables. During and\nafter each study, the files are also stored on the OneDrive and SharePoint of KU Leuven, respectively. These files will then be shared with the supervisors of this project (open, download) but full\naccess (add, delete) remains with the grant holder. Furthermore, every step in the analyses and methodology (e.g., data cleaning, recoding variables, etc.) undertaken by the researcher is\ndocumented either via codes or syntax files, so that replication and reviews are possible.\nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be\nused. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nThe datafiles generated from Qualtrics include metadata (e.g., date, number of\nsurvey, time, location, etc.) and are analyzed and recoded in SPSS. The format of this platform is used during this study for convenience purposes. More specifically, the xlsx files downloaded\nfrom both Qualtrics already include the metadata for each file and these are stored in the README.xlsx file mentioned above. The metadata files for the surveys will be saved as .csv files after the\nproject has ended.\n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\n1\n. \nDuring the research: Laurens Biesmans (grant holder, all rights), Diane Arijs (access), Rein De Cooman (access) and Yves Van Vaerenbergh (access) will be able to access the research.\nAfter the research, in the case the grant holder does not remain linked to an academic institution, all rights will be given to the other responsible persons.\n2\n. \nStorage during the research: on 1) OneDrive by KU Leuven on Laurens Biesmans' personal drive and 2) SharePoint by KU Leuven on Laurens Biesmans' personal drive. Emails from\nparticipants will be stored on Laurens Biesmans' KU Leuven private Y-Drive.\n3\n. \nStorage after the research: on 1) OneDrive by KU Leuven on one of the other responsible persons as well as on 2) their SharePoint by KU Leuven. Emails will be deleted from the Y-Drive.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nBy working with both OneDrive and SharePoint, all files will exist on two different cloud-storage platforms. This ensures us that in the case one source becomes inaccessible, the other is still\navailable Back-ups on these platforms happen automatically. At the end of every data collection, the data will also be stored on an external SSD that can only be accessed by the principal\ninvestigator using biometric verification and a password. In this way, offline access to the data is ensured.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nWe will only collect two sources of data: surveys and interviews. The former only consists of very small files that don't require much storage space. The latter will be converted to .mp3, which is\nalso more storage-friendly than .wav or .mp4. Since we only require limited interviewees during the project, the total storage space required for this is very small compared to subscription plans by\neither storage platform.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nOneDrive, SharePoint and the Y-Drive are only modifiable by signing in with the credentials of Laurens Biesmans. For this, he will only use a laptop administered by KU Leuven, with KU Leuven's\nnetwork security, and only when connected with a VPN to KU Leuven's servers. Access to the web interface is controlled through a Shibboleth authentication process. Access from other devices\nor access without proper access authorization is prevented by a combination of system and storage access control, encryption and firewalling of the systems involved. Data rights are limited to the\nproject supervisors, who make use of the same materials and protection measures as the grant holder, such that they can only access the data but not modify it.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nSince the basic subscription plans for data storage that were already set-up when the grant holder started at KU Leuven, no additional storage (costs) will be required.\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be\npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\nOnly the datafiles that are eventually used for the analyses in the research studies are retained, so other scholars could verify or replicate the results when necessary or requested. Also the data\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 28 April 2023\n7 of 9\nthat was collected during pilot studies is stored for the expected 10 years, in case the PhD researcher would prefer to carry out extra analyses or use the data for additional purposes (e.g.,\nverifying other hypotheses, providing an example during teaching courses, etc.). Datafiles with personal data (i.e., the e-mail addresses) are deleted as soon as they are no longer required.\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nA separate archive is made on the secured KU Leuven X-drive when the PhD researcher finishes a study to store the data for the longer term (i.e., the required 10 years).\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nNo costs are expected while storing the data, as this service is free for KU Leuven researchers. Nonetheless, unexpected costs can be carried by the FWO bench fee.\n5. Data sharing and reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made\navailable.\nYes, in an Open Access repository\nWe plan to provide our anonymized data on which the analyses of each study are based in an open access repository. However, if possible, only for a limited duration (10 years).\nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.\nN.A.\nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment\nsection per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nYes, Privacy aspects\nFor data collected at companies, we will only provide Open Access to those variables that are not attributable to natural persons. This means that qualitative data (as well as critical incidents or\nsuggestions for improvement for the company collected in surveys) will not be present.\nWhere will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.\nIn an Open Access repository. The anonymized datasets with documentation will be available through the \nOpen Science Framework\n, on my public profile.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nAfter publication of the results.\nWhich data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why.\nThe Open Science Framework works with licenses, which we possibly will use to avoid our data being used for commercial ends or modified by unauthorized people.\nDo you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section.\nYes\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nWe do not expect costs for data sharing. The OSF is a free service, managed and maintained by the Center for Open Science.\n6.

Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? Describe these issues in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. No SMEC-PRET approval: G-2021-4001-R6(AMD) Will you process personal data? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. Yes For all surveys, participants receive an anonymous link but they have the opportunity to share their email with the researchers so they can be informed about the results of the study they participated in. In the case of low response rates, the researchers may also provide an opportunity to share their email for a lottery. In study 3 & 4 we will collect multiwave data, meaning that during the first wave participants can leave their emails if they wish to participate in the next waves so that we can contact them to participate again. All e-mail addresses will be stored on the secure Y-drive of the Faculty of Economics and Business, KU Leuven, which is a central storage that only the primary researcher has access to. After the studies, e-mail addresses will be deleted since they no longer serve us a purpose. From that point on, survey data are fully anonymized. For the interviews, participants will be asked to tell about their latest recruitment experiences. In addition, we ask them about: which position they applied for and the outcome of this process. Private information, though not explicitly asked, such as income (e.g. when they talk about salary negotiations), will not be part of the analyses. The recordings will be converted to .mp3 files such that no faces can be recognized, and after names and other sensitive data is bleeped away, the identity of the interviewees becomes almost fully anonymous. Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes Surveys related to critical incident study (1): results can be used to create checklists for organizations about the factors most influential in improving or damaging the candidate experience. The outcomes studies (3 & 4) add to this knowledge by showing in what way these moments will affect attitudes and behavior beyond this lasting experience. Surveys related to the scale development (2): results are a measurement instrument for candidate experience, which can be adapted to specific organizations at different touchpoints during the application process. A general scale will be published in a scientific journal, but companies who wish more context-sensitive insight could consult a spin-off agency, or the researchers can develop a freemium model for different industries. For the latter, companies can freely access the published scale, but industry-relevant adaptations would require a fee. In addition, it is possible to turn the scale into a 'candidate experience dashboard' that companies can use to closely monitor their candidate experience. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements/ research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. No Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. Yes Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 28 April 2023 6 of 9 We will collect data in collaboration with external organizations, which currently are Crytek GmbH, Telenet, and Hudson. With these organizations, we have signed agreements that protects both us as them. For us this means that they can only use our scales and findings for internal use until our research related to these materials has been published. The agreements protect them such that their company-sensitive insights will only be used for scientific purposes, and that results will only be shared with other organizations at an aggregated level. In the future, if more data is needed or if valorization opportunities arise, other companies may join and be subject to the same agreement procedures. 2. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). For all data collections, an .xlsx file (similar to a README) of the used scales and instructions is prepared by the researcher and reviewed by the supervisors of this project. These files include the typologies of questions, the codes that were given to the variables in the datasets, the references of the original source of the variables and their response categories and variables. During and after each study, the files are also stored on the OneDrive and SharePoint of KU Leuven, respectively. These files will then be shared with the supervisors of this project (open, download) but full access (add, delete) remains with the grant holder. Furthermore, every step in the analyses and methodology (e.g., data cleaning, recoding variables, etc.) undertaken by the researcher is documented either via codes or syntax files, so that replication and reviews are possible. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. No The datafiles generated from Qualtrics include metadata (e.g., date, number of survey, time, location, etc.) and are analyzed and recoded in SPSS. The format of this platform is used during this study for convenience purposes. More specifically, the xlsx files downloaded from both Qualtrics already include the metadata for each file and these are stored in the README.xlsx file mentioned above. The metadata files for the surveys will be saved as .csv files after the project has ended. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? 1 . During the research: Laurens Biesmans (grant holder, all rights), Diane Arijs (access), Rein De Cooman (access) and Yves Van Vaerenbergh (access) will be able to access the research. After the research, in the case the grant holder does not remain linked to an academic institution, all rights will be given to the other responsible persons. 2 . Storage during the research: on 1) OneDrive by KU Leuven on Laurens Biesmans' personal drive and 2) SharePoint by KU Leuven on Laurens Biesmans' personal drive. Emails from participants will be stored on Laurens Biesmans' KU Leuven private Y-Drive. 3 . Storage after the research: on 1) OneDrive by KU Leuven on one of the other responsible persons as well as on 2) their SharePoint by KU Leuven. Emails will be deleted from the Y-Drive. How will the data be backed up? By working with both OneDrive and SharePoint, all files will exist on two different cloud-storage platforms. This ensures us that in the case one source becomes inaccessible, the other is still available Back-ups on these platforms happen automatically. At the end of every data collection, the data will also be stored on an external SSD that can only be accessed by the principal investigator using biometric verification and a password. In this way, offline access to the data is ensured. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes We will only collect two sources of data: surveys and interviews. The former only consists of very small files that don't require much storage space. The latter will be converted to .mp3, which is also more storage-friendly than .wav or .mp4. Since we only require limited interviewees during the project, the total storage space required for this is very small compared to subscription plans by either storage platform. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? OneDrive, SharePoint and the Y-Drive are only modifiable by signing in with the credentials of Laurens Biesmans. For this, he will only use a laptop administered by KU Leuven, with KU Leuven's network security, and only when connected with a VPN to KU Leuven's servers. Access to the web interface is controlled through a Shibboleth authentication process. Access from other devices or access without proper access authorization is prevented by a combination of system and storage access control, encryption and firewalling of the systems involved. Data rights are limited to the project supervisors, who make use of the same materials and protection measures as the grant holder, such that they can only access the data but not modify it. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Since the basic subscription plans for data storage that were already set-up when the grant holder started at KU Leuven, no additional storage (costs) will be required. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Only the datafiles that are eventually used for the analyses in the research studies are retained, so other scholars could verify or replicate the results when necessary or requested. Also the data Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 28 April 2023 7 of 9 that was collected during pilot studies is stored for the expected 10 years, in case the PhD researcher would prefer to carry out extra analyses or use the data for additional purposes (e.g., verifying other hypotheses, providing an example during teaching courses, etc.). Datafiles with personal data (i.e., the e-mail addresses) are deleted as soon as they are no longer required. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? A separate archive is made on the secured KU Leuven X-drive when the PhD researcher finishes a study to store the data for the longer term (i.e., the required 10 years). What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? No costs are expected while storing the data, as this service is free for KU Leuven researchers. Nonetheless, unexpected costs can be carried by the FWO bench fee. 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in an Open Access repository We plan to provide our anonymized data on which the analyses of each study are based in an open access repository. However, if possible, only for a limited duration (10 years). If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. N.A. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes, Privacy aspects For data collected at companies, we will only provide Open Access to those variables that are not attributable to natural persons. This means that qualitative data (as well as critical incidents or suggestions for improvement for the company collected in surveys) will not be present. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. In an Open Access repository. The anonymized datasets with documentation will be available through the Open Science Framework , on my public profile. When will the data be made available? After publication of the results. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. The Open Science Framework works with licenses, which we possibly will use to avoid our data being used for commercial ends or modified by unauthorized people. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. Yes What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? We do not expect costs for data sharing. The OSF is a free service, managed and maintained by the Center for Open Science. 6.
