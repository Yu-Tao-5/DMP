Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Physical data: Raw materials and samples generated during experiments will be stored in freezers or desiccators until the associated data has been published or until the end of the project (end of the associated PhD). For samples that are difficult to regenerate, a longe r storage period will be ensured. Digital data: Data will be stored on KU Leuven network drives: - Personal/‘I:’ network drive or OneDrive for Business storage (2 TB available to every PhD researcher – not for strictly confidential or personal data ) for daily personal use and data storage. - Archive/‘K:’ network drive will be used for storage of published data.

CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECUR ITY, NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 6 - Data stored on the Personal/‘I:’ network drive is only accessible to a specific researcher. This data is automatically backed up by ICT, KU Leuven. Access to KU Leuven network drives is automatically secured by multifactor authentication . - Data stored on OneDrive for Business is only accessible to a specific researcher. Version history (up to 100 versions per file) is enabled. Multifactor authentication can be activated as additional security measure. OneDrive for Business will not be used for strictly con fidential or personal data. - Final data files can also be stored on the Archive/‘K:’ network drive , which has restricted access (only professors and postdocs of the research group) . What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the resea rch project? How will these costs be covered? Storage capacity (on the Archive/‘K:’ network drive) can be increased for an annual fee of 100.86 Euro/TB. This data is automatically backed up by ICT, KU Leuven. Buying additional storage capacity can be covered by the consumables budget of the project. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). - Only physical samples that are difficult to regenerate will be reta ined after the end of the project. - All digital data will be retained for more than the expected 5 -year period, on the Archive/‘K:’ drive. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? The data will be copied to the Archive/‘K:’ network drive (with automatic back -up procedures) and stored for at least 5 years. To date, 1.3 TB storage is available, however if needed, additional data space can be obtained. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Annual fee of 100.86 Euro/TB. The research unit/project consumables budget will be used to cover this cost. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11 6.
