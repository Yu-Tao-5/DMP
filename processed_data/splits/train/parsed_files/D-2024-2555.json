In essence VC teaches clerics how they can reconcile their active, pastoral life with the ideal of the\ncontemplative, ascetic life. Pomerius’ treatise is a key text from Late Antique Christian literature: it survives in over 230 manuscripts (an impressive\nnumber for a text not written by one of the ‘great’ Latin Church Fathers), enjoyed consistent and wide popularity among Late Antique/Medieval\nauthors (many moralistic, pastoral and doctrinal texts between the 6th-15th cc. quote from VC), and had a lasting impact on, e.g., the development of\necclesiastical legislation, the conception of episcopal authority, and the organization of the clerical life in the Latin Church. Nonetheless, VC has been\nlargely neglected: no in-depth study of its transmission/reception exists and the most recent edition of the work is Patrologia Latina 59 (1847, based on\nan unsatisfactory edition from 1711). This project will bring back to light Pomerius’ treatise by providing (1) the first modern critical edition of VC,\nand (2) the first systematic study of its manuscript transmission and the Late Antique/Medieval reception of its ascetic-contemplative, pastoral,\nmoralistic, and doctrinal positions, to assess VC’s influence on the West’s religious tradition.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n20-03-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

The project will use the following datatypes: the primary data on VC’s transmission/reception derive directly from manuscripts, held in libraries all over Europe. These will be consulted online, photographed in situ, or digital photos will be ordered. The project will further rely on secondary literature in scientific libraries, either in paper (text editions, articles/books, catalogues etc.) or digital (LIMO, databases etc.) form. 2. The project will generate the following data: manuscript descriptions/collations, lists of source passages in VC, lists of quotations from VC in Late Antique/Medieval works, and analyses of VC’s transmission/reception that will be presented in publications.

The introduction will be published together with the edition as a printed volume in the Series Latina of the Corpus Christianorum . In this way, the introduction will provide scholars with all necessary information to understand the critical text and apparatuses of the edition itself. *Datasets on the reception of VC: all quotations identified from VC in later texts will be identified in reference to the edition of VC that is currently in use (Patrologia Latina 59, 1847), which allows other scholars to easily situate the passages within the text of VC.
