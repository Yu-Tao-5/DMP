Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNo\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nNo\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nYes\nAlthough tech transfer and valorisation are not direct goals of this project, if such an opportunity\npresents itself, it will be discussed among the PIs involved in the project. The conclusions of that\ndiscussion will be appended to this data management plan. As a general principle, the\nconcept/material/device will be registered first and published afterwards; the data will be reused\nunder the licence Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC-BY-NC-ND).\n \n \nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 6\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nRegarding data collected by researchers from the QSP division:\nDuring each experiment, a detailed logbook will be used (different logbooks for the different\nexperimental setups). These logbooks will contain the date, a brief description of the performed\nexperiment, the parameters used for each measurement, as well as the names of all the saved\nfiles.\nThe names of the files will be structured in a comprehensible way:\nsystem studied/date/main parameters used\nIn addition, data will be stored in a folder per experimental setup, the type of investigated\nsystem and the corresponding date. In this way, by tracking the corresponding logbook notes,\neach file can be easily found on the local computers controlling the setup and on the server of\nthe laboratory.\nThe analysis files will contain notes describing the analysis procedure and mention which original\ndata files are included. A readme file describing the goal of the experiment and the analysis\nprocedure will be stored in the folder where the data is saved.\n \nRegarding data collected by researchers from the SIEM division:\nThe research group joined the pilot program, iRODS, developed by the Research Data\nManagement Competence Center (RDM-CC) at KU Leuven to standardize data and metadata.\nThis allows us to define metadata for different data collections. For instance, we can assign fields\nlike \"user\", \"project\", \"instrument\", \"date\" to each of our files. The files will be stored in a\nuniversity-owned\nserver, free of charge and without space limitation. \"ReadMe\" txt files will be provided as\nlegends for the metadata fields and attributes. Regarding other kinds of generated data:\n1. Lab books will be classified by author and project. The inputs written in the lab books will\nbe organized by date.\n2. Microscopy images will be accompanied by a scale bar and a txt \"ReadMe\" file detailing\ntheconditions of the measurement (light intensity, contrast, magnification, etc.). The conditions\nwill be also annotated in the lab books.\n3. Standard equipment such as XRD, SEM, and EDS generates a metadata file with the\nmeasuring conditions. This file will be retained. The conditions will be also annotated in the lab\nbook. \nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nRegarding data collected by researchers from the QSP division:\nRegarding the experimental data, in the relevant research field, there is no formal metadata\nstandard. However, the standardized steps described in this section 4 will ensure that the data is\neasy to find and reuse.\nRegarding data collected by researchers from the SIEM division:\nThe data will be stored in folders named as the user. Then, each user will create its own\nfolder structure. Metadata referring to the date, project, equipment, type of data (paper, raw\ndata, presentation, etc.) ... will be assigned to each file. This feature is enabled by the iRODS\nplatform put in place by KU Leuven. The metadata attributes used for search are summarized in\ntxt \"ReadMe\" files. We will name the successive file versions as xxx_V1, xxx_V2, etc. Also, the\ndate when the file was generated will be used to track the version. The relevant datasets (except\nfor some unpublished SOPs and other files related to the group know-how) will be uploaded in\nOpenAIRE or Zenodo under a license. Hence, they will receive a DOI for identification.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nRegarding data collected by researchers from the QSP division:\nThe data, including raw data, analysis files, as well as reports and electronic logbooks, will be\nsaved on local computers. The data stored on these computers is backed-up daily on a local\nserver. A duplicate of this back-up is made on the back-up server. All researchers involved in the\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 6\nproject will have access to the corresponding folder.\n \nRegarding data collected by researchers from the SIEM division:\nAll the data will be first produced and stored in personal computers in the Department of\nMaterials Engineering (MTM) drives, and immediately shared in iRODS. The KU Leuven Box space\nwill be used to share data with external visitors and master students. Each researcher will be\nresponsible to transfer the data from their personal computer to the shared spaces.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nRegarding data collected by researchers from the QSP division:\nThe data stored on the local computers is continuously and automatically backed-up on local\nservers.\n \nRegarding data collected by researchers from the SIEM division:\nThe iRODS and BOX systems provides continuous and automatic backups.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThe amount of data that will be generated in this project should not exceed a few hundred GBs,\nwhich is small enough to be stored in local computers and on local servers. \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nThe costs are minimal and are covered by the project budget.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nRegarding data collected by researchers from the QSP division:\nThe data will be systematically transferred to the local server, with restricted access (managed\nby the IT responsible). Only the (co-)promotors and involved researchers have access to the\nshared folders where the data, analysis files and reports will be stored. Also, credentials are\nrequired to log in to local computers in the laboratories.\n \nRegarding data collected by researchers from the SIEM division:\nEach university-associated computer requires a password for logging in. This password must\nbe changed every year. Access to the iRODS and KU Leuven Box space is also protected by\na password. No sensitive data will be handled in this project. Each researcher will have access\nto their own data and the PI of the SIEM division (Francisco Molina-Lopez) will have access to the\nall the project data generated by researchers of the SIEM division.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nPhysical data in the form of lab books and samples will be retained for 5 years. Most samples\nwill degrade with time and will not be usable after 5 years. Due to space restrictions, lab books\nwill be retained also for 5 years. Digital data will be retained for 10 years.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nSamples and lab books will be stored for 5 years in dedicated cabinets in the laboratories. Digital\ndata will be retained for 10 years on local data storage facilities. Storing in a repository (such as\nZenodo) will be considered.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nThe system and cost allocation described in section 5.4 will also be used for data preservation\nafter the project ends. Costs are expected to be negligible and will be covered by other running\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n5 of 6\nprojects from the involved groups (in case of no running projects, accumulated reserves will be\nused).\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nNo\nThere are no legal restrictions or restriction related to IP potential.\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nAll data can be made available, for example if requested by the editor or publisher of a scientific\njournal or upon request of an individual (e.g. a researcher who intends to reproduce an\nexperiment).\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn an Open Access repository\nIn a restricted access repository\nUpon request and after the agreement of the project's PIs, all data can be made available on an\nopen repository (e.g. Zenodo), for example if requested by the editor or publisher of a scientific\njournal or via restricted access upon request of an individual (e.g. a researcher who intends to\nreproduce an experiment).\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nAfter the research results have been published and after agreement of the PIs (with a possible\nembargo time no longer than one year after the publication of the research)\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nAll involved researchers will have access to all the data. Upon request and after agreement of the\nPIs, access to the data can be granted to other individuals/parties.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nThe  will be no costs for data sharing. Since the volume of most files is not too large, freeware\ncan be used to transfer and share the files.\n8. Responsibilities\nWho will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?\nThe PIs of the project: Lino da Costa Pereira (QSP), Margriet Van Bael (QSP), Francisco Molina\nLopez (SIEM).\nWho will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nThe PIs of the project, together with the IT responsibles of the research groups, who are\nresponsible for the implementation of the storage and operation of the local servers.\nWho will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ?\nThe project PIs.\nWho bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nThe PIs of the project bear the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP: Lino da\nCosta Pereira (QSP), Margriet Van Bael (QSP), Francisco Molina Lopez (SIEM).\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n6 of 6"
