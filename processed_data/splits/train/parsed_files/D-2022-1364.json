In this project, we therefore focus on: (i) obtaining timely and reliable data on garden\ncomposition, configuration, use and management through an integrated use of novel data acquisition and analysis\napproaches like remote sensing, deep learning, and citizen science; (ii) strengthening the empirical knowledge base on the\nlink between these garden characteristics and urban climate, by combining remote sensing and autonomous sensor\nnetworks; (iii) gathering insight into the decision-making patterns of garden owners and identifying policy pathways for\nmobilizing them towards climate resilient gardening. \nFinally, we anticipate to integrate our new insights into the\ndevelopment of policy support tools for local and regional governments; allowing them to design and implement effective\nclimate mitigation and adaptation policies on domestic green space and to monitor the effects of these policies.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Does your research possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? Will\nIP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions will be\nasserted?\nNo. \n3.4. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If so, to\nwhat data do they relate and what restrictions regarding reuse and sharing are in place?\nGovernmental input data (data 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.15, 1.17, 3.7, 5.2) has the following\nrestrictions: \nhttps://overheid.vlaanderen.be/modellicentie-gratis-hergebruik\n. Any commercial or non-commercial reuse for\nan indefinite period of time is permitted at no cost. The sole condition of use is an obligation to acknowledge the source.\nCopernicus satellite data (data 1.16) has the following license: \nhttps://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp/#!/terms/licence-\nto-use-copernicus-products\n. The USGS satellite data (data 3.4) has also no restrictive license:\nhttps://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-are-terms-uselicensing-map-services-and-data-national-map\n.\nRegarding the official meteorological data provided by the RMI (data 3.3), we have the right to use but not to share the\ndata. Some other 3\nrd\n party agreements still need to be drafted (e.g. data 3.8 and 3.10). The DMP will be updated every\ntime a 3\nrd\n party agreement will be signed.\nAs co-developer and/or co-owner of some datasets such as Tuinenkaart (data 1.2), AVIRIS-NG (data 1.14) and MijnTuinlab\n(data 1.18), we will respect the applicable agreements.\nFor the personal data (1.2, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.8), an informed consent will be signed by all\nparticipants/respondents. \n4. Documentation and metadata\n4.1. What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of the data\ncollected/generated in this project?\nFor each work package and subtask, output data and supported documentation will be created in specified folders:\nA separate README text file with a fixed template that will be used by all researchers involved in the project,\ncontaining project and contact information, a description of the type and format of all input data (+ when applicable\nthe data collection method), the processing methods or scripts/workflows used to generate the output data and a\nclear description of the output data will be kept in the same folder.\nThe scripts and workflows will be also have “in-file” documentation in order to better understand data preparations\nand analysis. Moreover, a virtual environment will be created in which the code runs. The versions of the\nprogramming languages and packages used in it, will be documented. This environment can then be recreated for\nreusability/verifiability.\n When creating files, a clear file organization system will be used:\n1\n. \nFile naming: File names include the creation date, the project name, a clear (short) description of the data and the\nversion\nE.g. 20220325_GARLOCK_DMP_v3\n2\n. \nVersioning: creation dates and version names (v1, v2.2, …) are used to keep track of versions. Obsolete versions will\nbe deleted. Changes will also be documented.\n3\n. \nFile structure: subfolders for different projects and different work packages have been created.\n4.2. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used. If not, state in\ndetail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse.\nFor most input data, metadata files exist and will be stored together with the data\nFor each dataset that will be published or archived, a metadata file will be foreseen. The metadata file will follow the\nprescriptions defined by the Open data repository and/or will be based on the metafile structure of the input data. A data\nstandard will be used when applicable.\nFor satellite derived products metadata are included in GeoJSON file format. The GeoJSON implementation is based on the\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n8 of 11\nfollowing standards: https://www.ogc.org/standards/eo-geojson.\nOGC-17-003r1 – OGC EO Dataset\nMetadata GeoJSON(-LD) Encoding Standard OGC-17-084-v0.9.0-D2 - GeoJSON EO\nCollection Metadata Encoding Standard\n5. Data storage and backup during the project\n5.1. Where will the data be stored?\nNon-personal data\n will be stored on the KU Leuven \nsecured network discs \nand the \nOneDrive accounts\n of the\ninvolved researchers (backed up in the cloud) and on the Microsoft Teams pages of this project (backed up in the\ncloud). A time-stamped master copy will always be kept on the KU Leuven’s cloud storage systems. Copies can be\nmade and kept on personal devices and/or external hard-drives.\nDepending on the processing power and storage needed during the research project, large geospatial data could also be\nstored on the HPC VSC - High Performance Computing from the Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum – large volume storage\n(automatic backup).\nPseudonymized data:\nThe raw weather station data of the Leuven.cool network (data 3.2) is currently stored in a secured phpMyAdmin\nMySQL database (leuven.cool / localhost | phpMyAdmin 5.1.0). For the acquisition of the weather station data, we\nmake use of a secured MySQL database that is hosted on a virtual private server (VPS) hired for the project. We\nuse a cloud VPS from a private company based in The Netherlands. This VPS is used for both the reception and\nthe storage of the weather stations data. There are no personal data of the participants stored on this VPS.\nSecure storage of the sensor data of soil moisture/temperature (data 3.5) will technically be supported by\nCurieuzeneuzen in de tuin and the partnership of Orange.\nData storage of other sensor data, i.e. air quality (data 3.6), has not yet been defined, but will follow a parallel\ntrajectory as the weather station data. This will technically be supported by sensor and communication network\nexperts at ESAT, KU Leuven.\nSurvey data (data 1.20, 5.3, 5.4, 5.8) will be stored in a secured PostgreSQL database, hosted on the Spatial\nApplication Division Leuven (SADL) server (ICTS-S-DI-SADL1.lunah.kuleuven.be).\nInterview transcripts (5.6) will be stored at a secured network drive at KU Leuven. \n \nPersonal data\n will be stored at a secured network drive at KU Leuven (data 1.20) and a secured PostgreSQL (data 5.3,\n5.4, 5.8). Personal data of the sensor networks (data 3.2, 3.5 and 3.6) are stored on a drive where only the main\nresearchers have access to.\n5.2. How will the data be backed up?\nKU Leuven Onedrive and the secured network drives have an integrated back-up option.\nAn offline backup of the weather data stored on the VPS is currently performed on a regular basis.\n5.3. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no\nor insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes.\nCapacity for non-personal data:\nKU Leuven OneDrive and KU Leuven Teams: 2 TB/person (this can if necessary be raised to 5 TB without\nadditional costs)\nCapacity for personal data\nKU Leuven secured network disc: 1 TB (FNL) + 1 TB (IO)\n5.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How will these costs be\ncovered?\nKU Leuven provides every student and employee a standard OneDrive storage capacity of 2 TB, this can if necessary be\nextended to 5 TB without any additional costs.\nThe cost of data storage on the servers of the division is estimated at €2000. This cost is foreseen in the project budget.\nThe rental costs of the VPS (and other sensor network services) are covered by the operating costs of the department and\nthe project.\n5.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by\nunauthorized persons?\nNon-personal data\n: OneDrive and Teams are an enterprise cloud storage service with centralized security controls and\nmulti-layered encryption, authorized by KU Leuven (KU Leuven Authenticator tool).\nPersonal data:\n Personal information is stored separately from the survey and sensor data. An pseudonymized ID is used\nin the research data. At the database level, the researcher will not be able to identify the respondent.\nWhere possible, access to part of the survey data (data 5.3, 5.4, 5.8) is further refined and secured by an intermediate\nlayer that further shields the actual access to the database. Except for the necessary database administration, the data is\nonly available via this intermediate layer. Researchers of the project do have access to personal data via a specific account\nwhere this is necessary for the research, in addition to the database administration already mentioned (for example if\nsomeone needs to be contacted in the context of the research).\nOther personal data (data 1.20, 3.2, 3.5, 3.6) are located on secured drive where only the researchers as defined in the\nSMEC application have access to.\n6. Data preservation after the end of the project\n6.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the project? If only a\nselection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is the case (legal or contractual\nrestrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n9 of 11\nAll relevant data for the project will be retained for 10 years after the end of the project, in line with KU Leuven RDM-policy.\nThis includes data 1.19-1.21; 2.2-2.10; 3.2, 3.5, 3.6, 3.9, 3.11; 4.2-4.7; 6.2-6.6; 1.19-1.21; 5.3-5.8. Necessary\ndocumentation and metadata files that will help others understand the data and make it fully reusable: interview\nguidelines, processing methods, etc. will also be retained.\nSecondary data sources will not be retained. The services of these data sources are considered responsible for their own\ndata archive. Furthermore, depending on the 3\nrd\n party agreements we are also not permitted to retain some datasets (cf.\n3.3). In order to reuse the project outputs, we will make a step-by-step plan which includes information about the data\nprovider, the general form of the data (i.e. column names and data type) of the secondary input data. Potential other users\ncan consequently contact the responsible data provider. \nAfter the project, personal data will be retained in accordance with the informed consent of the respondents.\n6.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)?\nData will be archived on the KU Leuven network drives.\n6.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How will the costs be\ncovered?\nThe expected cost for preserving this data is estimated at €2000. This cost will be covered by the working budget of PI Ben\nSomers.\n7. Data sharing and re-use\n7.1. Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an\nagreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions or because of IP potential)?\nYes.\nThe personal data will not be shared in accordance with the informed consent of the respondents.\nThe official meteorological data provided by the RMI (data 3.3) will not be retained after the end of the project as we only\nhave the right to use it and not share it.\nDepending on the 3\nrd\n party data agreements (\nin progress\n) for datasets 3.8 and 3.10, restrictions on data sharing will be\ntaken into account.\n7.2. Which data will be made available after the end of the project?\nAll created output on the climate mitigation and adaptation potential of the garden complex (as defined in the GARLOCK\nproject – data 2.2-2.10; 4.2-4.7; 6.2-6.6) will be made available. In addition all primary material (including anonymized\npersonal data) to support the outputs (data 1.19-1.21; 3.2, 3.5, 3.6, 3.9, 3.11; 5.3-5.8) will be made available. Lastly, we\nwill also include all necessary documentation and metadata files that will help others understand the data and make it\nfully reusable: interview guidelines, processing methods, etc.\n7.3. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn an Open Access repository\nUpon request by mail\nThe datasets, scripts and workflows collected by the project (not including personal or pseudonymized data) will be\nuploaded in open-access repositories such as KU Leuven Research Data Repository (RDR) (\nResearch Data Repository (RDR)\n– RDR - Research Data Repository (kuleuven.be)\n) under a CC-BY license.\n7.4. When will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\n7.5. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nPersonal data\n: only the researchers mentioned in the approved SMEC file will be able to access the personal data. The\npseudonymized data will be stored in a secure drive and PostgreSQL database at the server of the division, where also only\na limited group of people have access too.\nOther data:\n these data will be made available to anyone for any purpose, provided that they give appropriate credit to\nthe creators (CC BY license).\n7.6. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nThere are no expected costs related to data sharing as RDR is free and open.\n8. Responsibilities\n8.1. Who will be responsible for the data documentation & metadata?\nWP1: Kelly Wittemans &  Janne Teerlinck\nWP2: Kelly Wittemans\nWP3: Valerie Dewaelheyns & Janne Teerlinck\n8.2. Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nWP1: Kelly Wittemans &  Janne Teerlinck\nWP2: Kelly Wittemans\nWP3: Valerie Dewaelheyns & Janne Teerlinck\n8.3. Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and sharing?\nWP1: Kelly Wittemans &  Janne Teerlinck\nWP2: Kelly Wittemans\nWP3: Valerie Dewaelheyns & Janne Teerlinck\n8.4. Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nThe PI bears the end responsibility of updating and implementing this DMP. We plan a recurrent update of the DMP.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n10 of 11\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n11 of 11"

    "clean_full_text": "Data Management Plan GARLOCK Project Name GARLOCK: Unlocking the climate change adaptation and mitigation potential of the garden complex - Data Management Plan GARLOCK Project Identifier 3E210512 Principal Investigator / Researcher Ben Somers, Trui Steen, Pieter Raymaekers, Florian Lange, Stien Heremans, Kelly Wittemans, Valerie Dewaelheyns, Janne Teerlinck, Marc Olijslagers Project Data Contact Valerie Dewaelheyns, +32 16 32 84 97, valerie.dewaelheyns@kuleuven.be Description Gardens are an integral part of the urban green and blue network but their potential for climate change mitigation and adaptation remains underutilized. In our GARLOCK project, we consider gardens as social-ecological systems and hypothesize that a full realization of this potential thus requires a better insight in and integration of their ecological and social dimensions. In this project, we therefore focus on: (i) obtaining timely and reliable data on garden composition, configuration, use and management through an integrated use of novel data acquisition and analysis approaches like remote sensing, deep learning, and citizen science; (ii) strengthening the empirical knowledge base on the link between these garden characteristics and urban climate, by combining remote sensing and autonomous sensor networks; (iii) gathering insight into the decision-making patterns of garden owners and identifying policy pathways for mobilizing them towards climate resilient gardening. Finally, we anticipate to integrate our new insights into the development of policy support tools for local and regional governments; allowing them to design and implement effective climate mitigation and adaptation policies on domestic green space and to monitor the effects of these policies.

Does your research possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted? No. 3.4. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions regarding reuse and sharing are in place? Governmental input data (data 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.15, 1.17, 3.7, 5.2) has the following restrictions: https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/modellicentie-gratis-hergebruik . Any commercial or non-commercial reuse for an indefinite period of time is permitted at no cost. The sole condition of use is an obligation to acknowledge the source. Copernicus satellite data (data 1.16) has the following license: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp/#!/terms/licence- to-use-copernicus-products . The USGS satellite data (data 3.4) has also no restrictive license: https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-are-terms-uselicensing-map-services-and-data-national-map . Regarding the official meteorological data provided by the RMI (data 3.3), we have the right to use but not to share the data. Some other 3 rd party agreements still need to be drafted (e.g. data 3.8 and 3.10). The DMP will be updated every time a 3 rd party agreement will be signed. As co-developer and/or co-owner of some datasets such as Tuinenkaart (data 1.2), AVIRIS-NG (data 1.14) and MijnTuinlab (data 1.18), we will respect the applicable agreements. For the personal data (1.2, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.8), an informed consent will be signed by all participants/respondents. 4. Documentation and metadata 4.1. What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of the data collected/generated in this project? For each work package and subtask, output data and supported documentation will be created in specified folders: A separate README text file with a fixed template that will be used by all researchers involved in the project, containing project and contact information, a description of the type and format of all input data (+ when applicable the data collection method), the processing methods or scripts/workflows used to generate the output data and a clear description of the output data will be kept in the same folder. The scripts and workflows will be also have “in-file” documentation in order to better understand data preparations and analysis. Moreover, a virtual environment will be created in which the code runs. The versions of the programming languages and packages used in it, will be documented. This environment can then be recreated for reusability/verifiability. When creating files, a clear file organization system will be used: 1 . File naming: File names include the creation date, the project name, a clear (short) description of the data and the version E.g. 20220325_GARLOCK_DMP_v3 2 . Versioning: creation dates and version names (v1, v2.2, …) are used to keep track of versions. Obsolete versions will be deleted. Changes will also be documented. 3 . File structure: subfolders for different projects and different work packages have been created. 4.2. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used. If not, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse. For most input data, metadata files exist and will be stored together with the data For each dataset that will be published or archived, a metadata file will be foreseen. The metadata file will follow the prescriptions defined by the Open data repository and/or will be based on the metafile structure of the input data. A data standard will be used when applicable. For satellite derived products metadata are included in GeoJSON file format. The GeoJSON implementation is based on the This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 8 of 11 following standards: https://www.ogc.org/standards/eo-geojson. OGC-17-003r1 – OGC EO Dataset Metadata GeoJSON(-LD) Encoding Standard OGC-17-084-v0.9.0-D2 - GeoJSON EO Collection Metadata Encoding Standard 5. Data storage and backup during the project 5.1. Where will the data be stored? Non-personal data will be stored on the KU Leuven secured network discs and the OneDrive accounts of the involved researchers (backed up in the cloud) and on the Microsoft Teams pages of this project (backed up in the cloud). A time-stamped master copy will always be kept on the KU Leuven’s cloud storage systems. Copies can be made and kept on personal devices and/or external hard-drives. Depending on the processing power and storage needed during the research project, large geospatial data could also be stored on the HPC VSC - High Performance Computing from the Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum – large volume storage (automatic backup). Pseudonymized data: The raw weather station data of the Leuven.cool network (data 3.2) is currently stored in a secured phpMyAdmin MySQL database (leuven.cool / localhost | phpMyAdmin 5.1.0). For the acquisition of the weather station data, we make use of a secured MySQL database that is hosted on a virtual private server (VPS) hired for the project. We use a cloud VPS from a private company based in The Netherlands. This VPS is used for both the reception and the storage of the weather stations data. There are no personal data of the participants stored on this VPS. Secure storage of the sensor data of soil moisture/temperature (data 3.5) will technically be supported by Curieuzeneuzen in de tuin and the partnership of Orange. Data storage of other sensor data, i.e. air quality (data 3.6), has not yet been defined, but will follow a parallel trajectory as the weather station data. This will technically be supported by sensor and communication network experts at ESAT, KU Leuven. Survey data (data 1.20, 5.3, 5.4, 5.8) will be stored in a secured PostgreSQL database, hosted on the Spatial Application Division Leuven (SADL) server (ICTS-S-DI-SADL1.lunah.kuleuven.be). Interview transcripts (5.6) will be stored at a secured network drive at KU Leuven. Personal data will be stored at a secured network drive at KU Leuven (data 1.20) and a secured PostgreSQL (data 5.3, 5.4, 5.8). Personal data of the sensor networks (data 3.2, 3.5 and 3.6) are stored on a drive where only the main researchers have access to. 5.2. How will the data be backed up? KU Leuven Onedrive and the secured network drives have an integrated back-up option. An offline backup of the weather data stored on the VPS is currently performed on a regular basis. 5.3. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes. Capacity for non-personal data: KU Leuven OneDrive and KU Leuven Teams: 2 TB/person (this can if necessary be raised to 5 TB without additional costs) Capacity for personal data KU Leuven secured network disc: 1 TB (FNL) + 1 TB (IO) 5.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How will these costs be covered? KU Leuven provides every student and employee a standard OneDrive storage capacity of 2 TB, this can if necessary be extended to 5 TB without any additional costs. The cost of data storage on the servers of the division is estimated at €2000. This cost is foreseen in the project budget. The rental costs of the VPS (and other sensor network services) are covered by the operating costs of the department and the project. 5.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Non-personal data : OneDrive and Teams are an enterprise cloud storage service with centralized security controls and multi-layered encryption, authorized by KU Leuven (KU Leuven Authenticator tool). Personal data: Personal information is stored separately from the survey and sensor data. An pseudonymized ID is used in the research data. At the database level, the researcher will not be able to identify the respondent. Where possible, access to part of the survey data (data 5.3, 5.4, 5.8) is further refined and secured by an intermediate layer that further shields the actual access to the database. Except for the necessary database administration, the data is only available via this intermediate layer. Researchers of the project do have access to personal data via a specific account where this is necessary for the research, in addition to the database administration already mentioned (for example if someone needs to be contacted in the context of the research). Other personal data (data 1.20, 3.2, 3.5, 3.6) are located on secured drive where only the researchers as defined in the SMEC application have access to. 6. Data preservation after the end of the project 6.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the project? If only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is the case (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...). This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 9 of 11 All relevant data for the project will be retained for 10 years after the end of the project, in line with KU Leuven RDM-policy. This includes data 1.19-1.21; 2.2-2.10; 3.2, 3.5, 3.6, 3.9, 3.11; 4.2-4.7; 6.2-6.6; 1.19-1.21; 5.3-5.8. Necessary documentation and metadata files that will help others understand the data and make it fully reusable: interview guidelines, processing methods, etc. will also be retained. Secondary data sources will not be retained. The services of these data sources are considered responsible for their own data archive. Furthermore, depending on the 3 rd party agreements we are also not permitted to retain some datasets (cf. 3.3). In order to reuse the project outputs, we will make a step-by-step plan which includes information about the data provider, the general form of the data (i.e. column names and data type) of the secondary input data. Potential other users can consequently contact the responsible data provider. After the project, personal data will be retained in accordance with the informed consent of the respondents. 6.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)? Data will be archived on the KU Leuven network drives. 6.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How will the costs be covered? The expected cost for preserving this data is estimated at €2000. This cost will be covered by the working budget of PI Ben Somers. 7. Data sharing and re-use 7.1. Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions or because of IP potential)? Yes. The personal data will not be shared in accordance with the informed consent of the respondents. The official meteorological data provided by the RMI (data 3.3) will not be retained after the end of the project as we only have the right to use it and not share it. Depending on the 3 rd party data agreements ( in progress ) for datasets 3.8 and 3.10, restrictions on data sharing will be taken into account. 7.2. Which data will be made available after the end of the project? All created output on the climate mitigation and adaptation potential of the garden complex (as defined in the GARLOCK project – data 2.2-2.10; 4.2-4.7; 6.2-6.6) will be made available. In addition all primary material (including anonymized personal data) to support the outputs (data 1.19-1.21; 3.2, 3.5, 3.6, 3.9, 3.11; 5.3-5.8) will be made available. Lastly, we will also include all necessary documentation and metadata files that will help others understand the data and make it fully reusable: interview guidelines, processing methods, etc. 7.3. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? In an Open Access repository Upon request by mail The datasets, scripts and workflows collected by the project (not including personal or pseudonymized data) will be uploaded in open-access repositories such as KU Leuven Research Data Repository (RDR) ( Research Data Repository (RDR) – RDR - Research Data Repository (kuleuven.be) ) under a CC-BY license. 7.4. When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results 7.5. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? Personal data : only the researchers mentioned in the approved SMEC file will be able to access the personal data. The pseudonymized data will be stored in a secure drive and PostgreSQL database at the server of the division, where also only a limited group of people have access too. Other data: these data will be made available to anyone for any purpose, provided that they give appropriate credit to the creators (CC BY license). 7.6. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? There are no expected costs related to data sharing as RDR is free and open. 8. Responsibilities 8.1. Who will be responsible for the data documentation & metadata? WP1: Kelly Wittemans & Janne Teerlinck WP2: Kelly Wittemans WP3: Valerie Dewaelheyns & Janne Teerlinck 8.2. Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project? WP1: Kelly Wittemans & Janne Teerlinck WP2: Kelly Wittemans WP3: Valerie Dewaelheyns & Janne Teerlinck 8.3. Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and sharing? WP1: Kelly Wittemans & Janne Teerlinck WP2: Kelly Wittemans WP3: Valerie Dewaelheyns & Janne Teerlinck 8.4. Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP? The PI bears the end responsibility of updating and implementing this DMP. We plan a recurrent update of the DMP.
