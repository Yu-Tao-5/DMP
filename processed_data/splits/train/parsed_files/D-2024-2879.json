Spurred by upcoming curricular reforms, the discussion has recently come to focus on the place of Dutch-language literary\nclassics in secondary education. Although there seems to be a strong believe in the necessity of teaching the classics in secondary school, there is little\nagreement on the most suitable didactics for teaching these works, nor on the amount of time teachers should allocate to them. Such discussions quickly\ndegenerate into a polemic of personal opinions due to the lack of systematic large-scale insights into educational practices, especial\n​\nly with regard to\nFlanders. \nThis project fills this urgent lacuna by obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the ways in which literary-historical texts from the Dutch language\narea are used, interpreted, and evaluated in contemporary secondary education, innova\n​\ntively including (a) concrete pedagogies and text selections in\nthe (culturally diverse) literature classroom, (b) values and aims of teachers, and (c) perceptions of students. By studying both Flanders and the\nNetherlands, this project aims to shed light on the hitherto under\n​\nstudied geographical differences. By closely collaborating with key educational\norganiza\n​\ntions, actively sparking a pro\n​\nduc\n​\ntive dialogue between academia and schools, Classics in the Classroom will provide an important contribution\nto the current canon debates and educational policies. \nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n26-03-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). The qualitative data produced in the project (open-ended survey questions; interviews; video recordings) will be analyzed through constant comparative analysis, resulting in code books. These code books will be stored in .pdfs that accompany the data. The quantitative data produced in the project (closed survey questions) will be analysed in LimeSurvey. The didactic materials collected in the project will be analyzed through close reading. Notes made in this process will be stored in .pdfs that accompany the data. The data will also be accompanied by a readme file explaining folder structure and file content, and by a file that explains the methodology of Created using DMPonline.be.

Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? All data and .pdfs accompanying the data will be stored in the secured workgroup folders provided by the faculty’s One Drive in the Campus network. The same holds for subsequent additional metadata, annotations and analyses that will be generated in this project. These folders will be backed-up daily. How will the data be backed up?

Yes See above How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? As mentioned above, all personal data will be stored at dataserver facilities at KULeuven. These dataservers are highly secured. Since the surveys are conducted online, the data will initially be on the software’s servers. These data will be transferred to the university’s serves immediately after the survey is closed, and will then be deleted from the software’s servers. The researcher has access to the personal data in the project. As mentioned above, personal data will not be shared with others. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? All costs of the storage above are covered by the faculty. 4.

In agreement with the faculty's IT division data will be stored on the faculty's network drives for a period of 5 years after the project. All books collected for the project will be kept in the Artes library. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? The data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for at least 5 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. Archiving will be discussed with the faculty's IT division. Books stay in the Artes collection. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? A cost estimate will be made with regard to the long-term storage of data on the faculty's network drives. In light of the type of data to be stored, this cost can be safely assumed to be relatively small and fundable out of the project budget. 5. Data sharing and reuse 5.

All data files that do not contain sensitive data (that is: all data except the video and audio files) will be publicly shared through DANS (as part of the partner University's policy). Although the survey does not explicitly ask for personal data, the survey answers will still be checked in order to make sure that we will not share data that might lead to the identification of participants.
