There the \nmaterial will be classified according to the threefold geographic lens  (supra) that is central to the research \nand will always be provided with a transparent name using a/the title, the archival creator(s), the archival \nrepository and the medium. The three-part structure of the classification is as follows: 1. local: separate \nleprosaria, 2. national: mission, State and parastatal organisations, 3. transnational: Vatican, WHO, \ninternational leprosy congresses. An additional branch 4 is intended for the interviews.\nWithin 1, a distinction is made between the region within Congo and the affiliation and size of the \nleprosarium. For example: 1. Leprosaria => 1.1. Equator Province => 1.1.1. Iyonda - R(oman)C(atholic) - CIO  \n(Centre d'Isolation Organisé).  \nWithin 2, a distinction is made between 1. State: < Ministry of colonies: hygiene service 2. Mission: \nSeparate provincial governments of missionary congregations (MSC, FDNSC, C.P., ...) 3. Separate \nparastatales (FOPERDA, FOREAMI, . ..). For example: 2. National => 2.2. Mission => 2.2.1. MSC => 2.2.1.1. \nMSC archive of the provincial authority of Borgerhout.  \nWithin 3, a distinction is made between 1. Vatican (different archive creators), 2. WHO (different archive \ncreators) and 3. international leprosy congresses (the various congresses). For example: 3. transnational, \n3.3. international leprosy congresses, 3.3.1. The Congress of Cairo (1938)\nWithin 4, a distinction is made between 1. the actual sound recordings and 2. the transcriptions. For \nexample: 4.

Each filename \nwill be standardized (surname author – compact title of article).\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10Will a metadata standard be used to make it \neasier to find and reuse the data ? \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard \nwill be used. If not, please specify which \nmetadata will be created to make the data \neasier to find and reuse.\nREPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN \nFORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. \nSTANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes\n☒ No\nThe metadata standard as provided in Zotero will be used for the literature. The metadata standard in \nTrophy will be used for the digital reproductions of the archival sources\n4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project\nWhere will the data be stored? During the project I will make use of the Onedrive cloud service provided by the Faculty: this storage space \nis safe and automatically backed up. I will standardly receive 2 TB in Onedrive storage, and I can request \nup to 5TB storage (free of charge) if necessary. I will purchase a pc through the Faculty’s ICT service with \nmy benchfee.

If so, please describe these issues further and refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate.☒ Yes, human subject data ☐ Yes, animal data ☐ Yes, dual use ☐ No If yes, please describe: 1. experiments of leprosy doctors on leprosy patients in medical journals (historic medical ethics was fundamentally different than today’s medical ethics), 2. sheets (fiches) with personal medical information (possibly of (ex-)patients still alive), 3. interviews with (formerly) stigmatized people in a country known for systematic human right violations 4 These data are generated by combining multiple existing datasets. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 7Will you process personal data5? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. If available, add the reference to your file in your host institution's privacy register.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes: -Short description of the kind of personal data that will be used: Idem, please see above (the personal and the ethical make a fundamental overlap). 1 &2: archival material and published primary sources; 3: recorded interviews and transcriptions -Privacy Registry Reference: not available Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin- offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please comment: Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please explain: Historical photographs and films of which the copyright has not yet expired, if not used as actual research objects. 5 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 83.Documentation and Metadata FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded).For the Archival Material: All collected research data will be stored in the KU Leuven Faculty of Arts OneDrive and Trophy . There the material will be classified according to the threefold geographic lens (supra) that is central to the research and will always be provided with a transparent name using a/the title, the archival creator(s), the archival repository and the medium. The three-part structure of the classification is as follows: 1. local: separate leprosaria, 2. national: mission, State and parastatal organisations, 3. transnational: Vatican, WHO, international leprosy congresses. An additional branch 4 is intended for the interviews. Within 1, a distinction is made between the region within Congo and the affiliation and size of the leprosarium. For example: 1. Leprosaria => 1.1. Equator Province => 1.1.1. Iyonda - R(oman)C(atholic) - CIO (Centre d'Isolation Organisé). Within 2, a distinction is made between 1. State: < Ministry of colonies: hygiene service 2. Mission: Separate provincial governments of missionary congregations (MSC, FDNSC, C.P., ...) 3. Separate parastatales (FOPERDA, FOREAMI, . ..). For example: 2. National => 2.2. Mission => 2.2.1. MSC => 2.2.1.1. MSC archive of the provincial authority of Borgerhout. Within 3, a distinction is made between 1. Vatican (different archive creators), 2. WHO (different archive creators) and 3. international leprosy congresses (the various congresses). For example: 3. transnational, 3.3. international leprosy congresses, 3.3.1. The Congress of Cairo (1938) Within 4, a distinction is made between 1. the actual sound recordings and 2. the transcriptions. For example: 4. Interviews 4.1. sound recordings 4.1.1. interview Edith Lechat-Dasnoy For the Litterature: The metadata of the literature used for this project will be stored and generated by Zotero. Each filename will be standardized (surname author – compact title of article). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☒ No The metadata standard as provided in Zotero will be used for the literature. The metadata standard in Trophy will be used for the digital reproductions of the archival sources 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? During the project I will make use of the Onedrive cloud service provided by the Faculty: this storage space is safe and automatically backed up. I will standardly receive 2 TB in Onedrive storage, and I can request up to 5TB storage (free of charge) if necessary. I will purchase a pc through the Faculty’s ICT service with my benchfee. All PCs purchased through the Faculty have Bitlocker pre-installed, which means sensitive data are protected by the Bitlocker system. Following the Arts Faculty’s policy regarding data management, I will make use of the KU Leuven data repository RDR, which allows me to store the data in a funder compliant manner before the project reaches its end. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.6 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.Please see above (question 4.1.) Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: According to the current prognosis, the current 2TB limit on my KU Leuven Faculty of Arts OneDrive will sufficient. If that is not the case, I will request a free extension to 5TB in time. If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7Please see above (question 4.1.)
