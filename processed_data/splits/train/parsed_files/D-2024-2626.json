The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 1\n1.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Nicolas Scepi\nOrcid: 0000-0003-3909-2486\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Fabio Bacchini\nOrcid: 0000-0002-7526-8154\nProject number 1 & title  Project number: 12AVW24N\nTowards the most realistic radiative models of luminous black hole accretion\nFunder(s) GrantID 2\nAffiliation(s)  KU Leuven\nROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number. This question is optional. Applicants can only provide one project number.2 Funder(s) GrantID refers to the number of the DMP at the funder(s), here one can specify multiple GrantIDs if multiple funding sources were used.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 2\nPlease provide a short project description Black holes (BHs) are typically surrounded by plasma (a tenuous, hot gas of charged particles) that\naccretes onto them, i.e. falls inward. As accretion proceeds, plasmas are heated and emit light,\nwhich we observe on Earth. Most studies of BHs focus on a minority population of luminous BHs.\nEven for these luminous BHs, we have reliable interpretive tools only for the dense emitting gas.\nInterpreting emission from low-density, optically thin and/or collisionless regions requires modeling\nprocesses at both the macro-scale of the accretion flow and the micro-scale of the particles\nultimately radiating. In this proposal, I explain how I will create the most realistic radiative models of\nluminous BHs to date, including the low-density regions that produce the highest energy emission,\nby developing a new version of the public code BHAC able to self-consistently treat the physics at the\nfluid scale and the particle scale using the best radiation treatment in the community. This work\nrepresents a huge step towards the resolution of outstanding problems such as BH spectral state\nchanges, jet formation in luminous disks or the origin of quasi-periodic oscillations but will also\nrevolutionize interpretative tools using fast photometric and spectral variability. These revolutionary\nmethods will help interpreting existing and future observations from missions such the all-sky X-ray\nsurvey eROSITA, the gamma-ray detector CTA, the X-ray polarimeter IXPE or the Athena X-ray\nobservatory.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 3\n2.Research Data Summary\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 4\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of. Yes\n No\nWe expect that our production runs + test runs will amount to a maximum of ~10 TB of data at the end of \nthe FWO. There is enough space on the Large Volume Storage to store this for long-term storage. During \nthe FWO, we will use the shared network drive for data we are working on and the Large Volume Storage \nfor data that is not used actively. We will strive to have a maximum of 2TB of data on the shared network \ndrive at any time and move the rest to the Large Volume Storage.\nIf no, please specify:\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely \nstored and not accessed or modified by \nunauthorized persons?\nCLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, \nNETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND \nFILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND \nTRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE.\nGuidance on security for research dataOnly I and Fabio Bacchini will have access to the data on the Large Volume Storage and  \nthe shared network drive.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 9\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?We estimate to need only 500GB of memory on the shared network drive for the first year since it will be \nmainly dedicated to development and so not very data heavy. For the second and third year, we will \npurchase 2TB on the shared network drive. We will also increasingly need space on the Large Volume \nStorage as we accumulate data from simulations. We estimate 5TB for the second year and 10TB for the \nthird year. Hence, we estimate the costs to be:\n 1st year : ~250 euros\n2nd year : ~1,500 euros\n3rd year : ~2,000 euros\nThese expenses will be covered by the bench fee of 4,000 euros yearly that has already been approved  by \nthe FWO. We might ask for an extra 2,000 euros (over three years) to the FWO to ensure that the bench \nfee is enough to cover for travel and data storage.\n5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 10\nWhich data will be retained for at least five \nyears (or longer, in agreement with other \nretention policies that are applicable) after the \nend of the project? In case some data cannot be  \npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this \n(e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\n Guidance on data preservation All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy\n All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with \nmedicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans\n Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain)\nWe will keep the data to a maximum of 5 years for budget issue. Moreover, with the always increasing \nperformance of numerical codes and computing hardware, it is more costly (money-wise and \nenvironmentally/energy-wise) to store the data than to redo a simulation with a code and hardware \nwhose performances might have doubled or tripled over 5 years. Of course, we will keep the configuration  \nfiles of each simulations to ensure that we are able to rerun the exact same simulation. Those files are of \nthe order of the KB.\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long-term)?\nDedicated data repositories  are often the best place \nto preserve your data. Data not suitable for \npreservation in a repository can be stored using a KU \nLeuven storage solution, consult the  interactive KU \nLeuven storage guide . KU Leuven RDR\n Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes)\n Shared network drive (J-drive)\n Other (specifiy):\nFor storage during the five years after the FWO, we will keep only 1TB of data with only the last restart \n(.dmp format) files of our ~10 production runs and some 3D snapshots for each simulation (.vtk format). \nThe restart files are the biggest files with an estimated size of ~20-30 GB per simulation for our highest \nresolutions while the 3D snapshots have an estimated size of ~1-2 GB. We will also keep 2D snapshots and \ntime and azimuthally averaged snapshots of the data as well as the configuration files for each simulation. \nThose are respectively of the order of ~MB and ~KB and so are not an issue to store.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 11\nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during the expected retention \nperiod? How will these costs be covered?The purchase of  1TB of data on the Large Volume Storage for five years will cost 500 euros, which we will \npay in advance with our bench fee provided by the FWO.\n6.

FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 2 Please provide a short project description Black holes (BHs) are typically surrounded by plasma (a tenuous, hot gas of charged particles) that accretes onto them, i.e. falls inward. As accretion proceeds, plasmas are heated and emit light, which we observe on Earth. Most studies of BHs focus on a minority population of luminous BHs. Even for these luminous BHs, we have reliable interpretive tools only for the dense emitting gas. Interpreting emission from low-density, optically thin and/or collisionless regions requires modeling processes at both the macro-scale of the accretion flow and the micro-scale of the particles ultimately radiating. In this proposal, I explain how I will create the most realistic radiative models of luminous BHs to date, including the low-density regions that produce the highest energy emission, by developing a new version of the public code BHAC able to self-consistently treat the physics at the fluid scale and the particle scale using the best radiation treatment in the community. This work represents a huge step towards the resolution of outstanding problems such as BH spectral state changes, jet formation in luminous disks or the origin of quasi-periodic oscillations but will also revolutionize interpretative tools using fast photometric and spectral variability.

Hence, we estimate the costs to be: 1st year : ~250 euros 2nd year : ~1,500 euros 3rd year : ~2,000 euros These expenses will be covered by the bench fee of 4,000 euros yearly that has already been approved by the FWO. We might ask for an extra 2,000 euros (over three years) to the FWO to ensure that the bench fee is enough to cover for travel and data storage. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10 Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) We will keep the data to a maximum of 5 years for budget issue. Moreover, with the always increasing performance of numerical codes and computing hardware, it is more costly (money-wise and environmentally/energy-wise) to store the data than to redo a simulation with a code and hardware whose performances might have doubled or tripled over 5 years. Of course, we will keep the configuration files of each simulations to ensure that we are able to rerun the exact same simulation. Those files are of the order of the KB. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide . KU Leuven RDR Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) Shared network drive (J-drive) Other (specifiy): For storage during the five years after the FWO, we will keep only 1TB of data with only the last restart (.dmp format) files of our ~10 production runs and some 3D snapshots for each simulation (.vtk format). The restart files are the biggest files with an estimated size of ~20-30 GB per simulation for our highest resolutions while the 3D snapshots have an estimated size of ~1-2 GB. We will also keep 2D snapshots and time and azimuthally averaged snapshots of the data as well as the configuration files for each simulation. Those are respectively of the order of ~MB and ~KB and so are not an issue to store. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11 What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?The purchase of 1TB of data on the Large Volume Storage for five years will cost 500 euros, which we will pay in advance with our bench fee provided by the FWO. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS Yes, as open data Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) No (closed access) Other, please specify: We will share 2D snapshots and time-averaged and azimuthally averaged versions of our numerical 3D simulations. These 2D snapshots and averaged data will be made available to the public on the journal website as 2D vtk files sizing ~1-2 MB for our highest resolution runs. We will also provide the Jupyter notebooks that were used to make the plots and analyse the data to ensure complete reproducibility of our results. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12 Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes, privacy aspects Yes, intellectual property rights Yes, ethical aspects Yes, aspects of dual use Yes, other No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. KU Leuven RDR Other data repository (specify) Other (specify) We will share the data on the publishing journal website. When will the data be made available? Upon publication of research results Specific date (specify) Other (specify) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13 Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. Check the RDR guidance on licences for data and software sources code or consult the License selector tool to help you choose. CC-BY 4.0 (data) Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) MIT licence (code) GNU GPL-3.0 (code) Other (specify) Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA. Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository My dataset already has a PID No The data will have the DOI of the journal publication. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?None submission to the Astrophysics & Astronomy Journal is free for European researchers. 7.
