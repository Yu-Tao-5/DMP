In early OA cartilage, mechanoadaptation is challeng ed. In this project, I aim to address the \nfundamental knowledge gap on why in early OA the anabolic response to mechanical loading is \nimpaired. Our key hypothesis states that hyper -activation of Wnt signaling impairs the anabolic \nchondrocyte response upon physiologic, mechanical stimulation via the integrins/cytoskeleton axis.  \nOn a longer time horizon, the insights of this project will be the basis of innovative mechano -therapy \nconcepts to rescue the anabolic responses of early OA cartilage through an optim ally-tuned combination \nof biological and mechanical stimulation. These regenerative interventions have the unique potential to \nprevent early structural cartilage changes that would otherwise progress to end -stage OA.  \nInstitution:  KU Leuven  \n \n \n1. GENERAL  INFORM ATION  \n \nName applicant  \nNuria Viudes -\nSarrión  \n \nFWO  Project  Number &  Title \n1S18023N  - Effective mechanotherapy in early osteoarthritis through modulation of Wnt -induced \nintegrin/cytoskeleton axis dysregulation.  \n \nAffiliation  \n● KU Leuven  \n \n \n2. DATA  DESCRIPTION  \n \nWill you generate/collect  new data and/or  make  use of  existing  data?  \n● Generate  new data \n● Reuse  existing  data \n \nDescribe  the origin, type  and format  of the  data (per dataset)  and its (estimated)  volume,  ideally  \n2  per objective  or WP of  the project.  You might  consider  using  the table  in the guidance.  \nData used in this project will mostly be new data . Existing data of interest are transcriptome datasets  \nfrom the research  team,  available  from the GEO  repository  (https:/ /www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/),  under  \naccession  numbers  GSE77916  and GSE33656.  \nNew data are quantitative and qualitative experimental data including raw data, derived and  \ncompiled data.  Overall, data will be from biological (molecular, biochemical) experiments and from  \nanimal model experiments. Qualitative raw data (photos, images) will be stored in investigator hard -copy  \nnotebooks and in digital formats (TIFF, PDF). Original data files outputs from quantit ative experiments will  \nbe collected in Excel datasheets. For data sharing across platforms, data will be additionally stored in csv  \nand txt formats. Data anaysis files will be pfzx files (Prism), sav files (SPPS) and R -project files with  \noutputs stored as txt and csv files. Animal experiment data are registered into KU Leuven's animal  \nexperiment LAIS system and compiled in excel and text files. Data from animal experiments are both  \nqualitative and quantitative as above (tissue sections, images) and processe d data such as scoring of  \ncartilage damage. Data will be stored in notebooks and in digital format as above.  Masterdata files will be  \nwrite -protected  after entering  all data.  \nData will be structured per experiment performed (Exp identifier) with structured  subsets: 1. raw data (txt - \ncsv) 2. analyses (txt - csv) 3. images (various formats) 4. \"readme\" txt information files. Additional  \nstructured  datasets  will be stored  per derived  manuscript.  \n \n \n3. LEGAL  & ETHICAL  ISSUES  \n \nWill you use personal  data?

If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant  \nethical  review  committee(s)  \n● Yes \nThe healthy and early OA chondrocytes used for this project will be harvested from a dedicated  \nrodent model, which is already well  established in the host laboratory as a synergy with ongoing  \nproject granted to Prof. Jonkers in collaboration with Prof. Lories. The data for the ethical  \ncommittee approval is: \nLicense number Department: LA1210189  \nResponsible PI: Rik Lories  \nProject numbe r: P134/2018  \nTitle of the project: De rol van mechanische belasting in kraakbeen homeostase, degeneratie en  \nherstel: een multi -schaal aanpak  \n \nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? Will IP \nrestrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions will be \nasserted?  \n● No \n3   \nDo existing  3rd party  agreements  restrict  dissemination  or exploitation  of the data you (re)use?  If \nso, to what  data do they relate  and what  restrictions  are in place?  \n● No \n \n \n4. DOCUMENTATION  & METADATA  \n \nWhat  documentation  will be  provided  to enable  reuse of  the data collected/generated  in this \nproject?  \nThe following documentation will be provided:  \n-A table of content (excel file and csv) with  all project - related experiments including experiment number, \ndate of implementation and name of the researcher  who stored the experiment,  \n-Brief description of the goal of the experiment and related work package  (word and txt file),  \n-Detailed protocol or link to an existing standard protocol (SOP)  \n-All data or link to another file with the (raw) data,  \n \nFor animal work: a list of the used animals with details such as age, sex, housing and link with LAIS \nsystem  information,  samples  that are generated during  the experiments  will be stored  and listed  in a Cvs  \nfile or txt file, if appropriate, illustrations of the data with legends and statistical analysis.  \n \nIn case that  documentation  is written  or available  in notebooks  or stored  on other  files a link will be \nprovided.  Read -me text files providing  information  about  definitions  used  in the dataset  files. \n \nWith the help of  these  documentations  every  authorized researcher  will be able (1) to look up all  the \ninformation  of the performed  experiments  and (2) to repeat  the experiment  in exactly  the same  way. \n \nWill a metadata standard  be used?  If so, describe  in detail  which  standard  will be used.  If no, \nstate in  detail  which  metadata  will be created  to make the data easy/easier  to find and reuse.  \n● No \nOur anticipated data collection does not involve setups for which a metadata standard and specific  \nrepository  exists.  Data  will therefore  maximally  be stored  in portable  formats  such as txt, csv and pdf \n \n \n5. DATA  STORAGE  & BACK  UP DURING  THE FWO PROJECT  \n \nHow  is back up  of the data  provided?  \nThe data will be stored  on the university's  central  servers  with automatic  daily back -up procedures,  \nincluding  ICTS Luna  storage.

How  will \nthe costs  be covered?  \nFor this project  data storage  of 1Tb is anticipated,  resulting  in a cost of 520 euro per year,  which  can be \ncovered  by the grant  and beyond.  \n \n \n7. DATA  SHARING  AND  REUSE  \n \nAre there  any factors  restricting  or preventing  the sharing  of (some  of) the data (e.g. as defined  in \nan agreement  with a 3rd party,  legal  restrictions)?  \n● No \n \nWhich  data will  be made available after  the end  of the project?  \nUpon publication of the research results  \n \n5  Where/how  will the data  be made  available  for reuse?  \n● In an Open  Access  repository  \n● In a restricted  access  repository  \n● Upon  request  by mail \nThe main  output  of the project  will be original  scientific  research  papers.
