The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning.

Due to advances in \ngenome sequencing we now know what the mutations are that differ between individual genomes, but \ntheir functional interpretation has been more difficult. Synonymous mutations in particular have been \nlargely ignored as they preserve the amino acid sequence of a protein and are thus thought to be \nfunctionally silent. Some examples now show that synonymous mutations can impact protein function and  \ncause disease, but a systematic assessment is missing due to a lack of technologies that can measure their \nimpact at scale. We have recently developed a CRISPR-based tool that can engineer and measure the \nimpact of any mutation, for 1000s of mutations in parallel. We will apply it here to test our hypothesis that  \nsynonymous mutations are a key (and falsely neglected) source of phenotypic diversity. Combining \ngenome editing, functional genomics and bioinformatics we will engineer naturally occurring and artificial \nsynonymous mutations in the model S. cerevisiae to for the first time study their role as drivers of \nphenotypic change and uncover mechanisms how these mutations alter protein expression and function \ndespite conserving protein sequence. This will cause a paradigm shift in our understanding of how \ngenotype determines phenotype with the potential to change biology textbooks.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

Scripts and software are additionally hosted on Github. All data will be stored for at least 10 years, conform to KU Leuven RDM policy. Costs are covered by general lab financing. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: Text documents and Excel files stored within each experiment folder will respectively contain guidelines describing data collection/analysis methods and all relevant metadata (including experimental conditions, quality control metrics, computational analysis pipelines and their parameters) to ensure the reusability of the data and the reproducibility of any further data generation. Scripts are documented and version control is ensured via Github.

Scripts and software hosted on Github are maintained as private folders. Unauthorized persons do not have access to lab freezers as badge access is needed to the building, and after 18:00 also to the lab spaces. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Costs are covered by general lab financing. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): -Dropbox Business account, 256-bit AES and SSL/TLS encryption. Raw and processed sequencing data and any end values derived from these data will be stored on a server in an ordered structure, and a separate hard drive as third backup. All data will be stored for at least 10 years, conform KU Leuven RDM policy. -Yeast strains are stored in a -80°C freezer and as yeast and plasmid library pool in the lab, for at least 10 years after the project ends.

FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 126. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, as open data ☒ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☐ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☒ No (closed access) ☒ Other, please specify: We aim for several manuscripts with the data generated in this project. Conform to the Open Access publication requirement for FWO, data used in published manuscripts will be openly available (eg via SRA, Github, dedicated websites, as supplemental material) either immediately upon publication or after potential embargo periods. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Only lab members can access the data. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?

This will be decided in cooperation with IP experts from KU Leuven and VIB. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.Not yet applicable When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 To be decided at a later point, variable depending on data type. 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☒ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ No If yes: What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? No extra costs 7.
