In order to maintain patient\nconfidentiality, all data from the participating study patients will be coded. UZ Leuven will\nmaintain the link between the patient’s identifier codes and the patient’s names.\nThe privacy approval is part of the GDPR (S66438).\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)?

Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nYes\nYes, the patient data, along with model data and test data are confidential for valorisation at a\nlater stage.\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\n- Python and Matlab code are explained with text in between the lines of the code to explain what\nthe code does.\n- Patient data (CT scans, x-rays, sonographs and surveys) will be labeled with an identifier\nnumber. The link between this number and the patient is maintained by UZ Leuven. A clear\nlabeling system and foldering will be used to structure the various kinds of data belonging to a\npatient. For the medical images, the DICOM metadata standard will be used.\n- Simulation results are accompanied by an excel file specifying relevant simulation parameters\nand input data used.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nNo metadata standard will be used. But the above-mentioned documentation for code, the use of\nfolders and the recording of simulation parameters for simulations ensure the correct\ninterpretation of the data and allow for easy reuse.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nAll software and data will be stored on the university's servers. These are\nautomatically backed up. Also, OneDrive servers with automatic backups will be used. After\ncompletion of the project, prof. Joost Duflou (STIFF) and prof. Jos Vander Sloten (promotor) will\ntake over this task.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic daily back-up\nprocedures.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project?

How\nwill these costs be covered?\nCosts for data storage and backup (I-drive, J-drive and OneDrive) are accounted for in the C2\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 5\nproject (STIFF) budget.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nOnly authorized persons have access to the data. Persons have access to individual storage on\nthe university's servers. Servers that are available to everyone in the project, will be used to\nstore/share data that everyone is allowed to have access to (OneDrive).\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll clinical data (CT scans, x-rays, sonographs) and data that is used for papers (in case the\ncommunity asks for details about the research) will be retained for at least 25 years after the end\nof the project.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nData stored on university's servers (K-drive) with automatic back-up for at least 10 years. \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nK-drive is used for long term achiving. The cost for this is €100/TB/year. Estimated volume of\ndata is between 200GB and 400GB.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nNo\nThere are no restricting factors. The (anonymized) patient data should only be used by those who\nare granted access by the ethical committee.\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nData that is used for papers will be made available upon publication.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn an Open Access repository\nOther (specify):\nOpen access (SimTK for opensim data, GitHub for code) and paper data on request.\nThe research data repository (RDR) will also be used to store data, including all the necessary\ndocumentation that will help others understand the data and make it fully reusable.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nProfessors involved in the research and future researchers in the department. Open acces data\nfor everyone.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nData sharing on SimTK and GitHub is free. \n8. Responsibilities\nWho will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?\nPieter Ansoms will be responsible for documenting the generated matlab and python code for the\nin-silico model, as well as for the structure in and the documentation of the (anonymized)\npatient-data. Anonymization of this data and the documentation thereof will be handled by Dr.\nMichiel Herteleer and Prof. Harm Hoekstra\nWho will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 5\nAll researchers are responsible for storage and backup of the data they produce.\nWho will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ?\nDuring the project, all researchers are responsible for storage and backup of the data they\nproduce.

Jos Vander Sloten\n(promotor) take over this task.\nWho bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nDay-to-day data management is the responsibility of Pieter Ansoms.
