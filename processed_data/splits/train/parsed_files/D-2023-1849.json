Several therapies exist already, but no universal pain reliever\nhas been identified so far. Our goal is to modulate precise brain circuits to relieve pain instantaneously without the need for drugs. We will\nstudy pain in head-fixed mice receiving a calibrated nociceptive cold or hot stimulus on the forepaw. We will record simultaneously brain-\nwide activity using volumetric functional ultrasound imaging (vfUSI) and animal behavior using fast video cameras. The facial expression\nof pain will also be decoded using artificial intelligence. Our preliminary data show that several brain nuclei, including the basolateral\namygdala (BLA), are differentially affected in WT mice versus KO mice not sensitive to pain. We will use multi-electrode arrays to\nprecisely study the role of BLA in thermal nociception. The second aim is to identify which cell types are involved by modulating the\nelectrical activity of the BLA circuit using vfUSI with optogenetics (opto-vfUSI). Here, we will activate and inhibit the same BLA neuronal\npopulation alternatively during both hot and cold painful stimuli. We will compare the effects in both the brain imaging data and the\nbehavior/facial expression. These experiments may identify new brain regions involved in nociceptive pain and inspire the development of\ninnovative therapeutical strategies at the neural circuit level.\nLast modified: \n08-05-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
