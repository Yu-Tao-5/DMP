The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan.

Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Yearly storage costs of 1TB data on the K-drive: 56.92 euros. Costs will be covered by internal lab funding.

If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Other data repository (specify) ☒ Other (specify) Data will be published using open access publications and will be available at dedicated data in supplementary files, in particular for GeoMX and CosMX nanoString data, which will be provided as normalised reads. Unpublished research data will be accessible to the PI's group and all scientific collaborators involved in the project When will the data be made available? ☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED.
