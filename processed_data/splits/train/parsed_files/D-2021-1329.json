Objects are represented in the lateral and ventral occipitotemporal cortex but it \nhas proven to be difficult to distill an integrative view of the complex functional architecture of these \nregions. Bao et al. (Nature, 2020) proposed a comprehensive map of object space in the inferior temporal  \ncortex of monkeys: the inferior temporal cortex is organized as a map with two main dimensions, stubby-\nspiky and animate-inanimate. However, the study suffers from some limitations that we aim to resolve. it \nis unclear to what extent we can extrapolate from monkeys to humans. While overall their stimulus set \ndissociated stubby-spiky from animate-inanimate, this was not true within stimulus classes and the other \nvisual dimensions were not controlled between animate and inanimate stimuli. Moreover, they considered  \na unique object space along the ventral visual pathway that is not in line with observed transitions in \nrepresentational content along the anatomical posterior to the anterior axis in humans. Finally, they didn’t \nassess the time course with which model elements take part in object recognition. The proposed project \naims at: examining the object space of Bao et al., 2020 in humans, testing and finetuning their proposals \nbased upon experiments that dissociate the relevant dimensions, and characterizing the temporal \ndynamics of the refined object representation model.\nInstitution: KU Leuven\n1. GENERAL INFORMATION\nName of the project lead (PI)\nHans Op de Beeck \nFWO Project number & title\n12A6122N FWO \nTHE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL STRUCTURE OF VISUAL OBJECT SPACE IN THE HUMAN BRAIN\n2. DATA DESCRIPTION\n22.1. Will you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?  \n●Generate new data\n2.2. What data will you collect, generate or reuse? Describe the origin, type and format of the data \n(per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a numbered list or table and per \nobjective of the project.\nType 1: \nType: Behavioural responses of participants to visual tasks on computer or using online platform.  \nFormat: Mostly .mat (Matlab files) or .csv  \nSize: 1-10 GB \nHow created: Output of experimental scripts written in e.g. Matlab (PsychToolbox) or Python (PsychoPy)  \n  \nType 2: \nType: Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of the brain, Structural & Functional  \nFormat: Mostly NIfTI or DICOM  \nSize: 300 GB - 1 TB (the latter including intermediate  processing steps) \nHow created: MRI research scanner  \n  \nType 3: \nType: Electroencephalography (EEG)  \nFormat: Depending on software, often .py and .mat  \nSize:  40 GB - 100 GB (the latter including  intermediate processing steps) \nHow created: EEG equipment (electrodes attached to the skin)  \n  \nType 4: \nType: Computer simulation data  \nFormat: Depending on software, often .py and .mat  \nSize: 500 GB \nHow created: By implementing artificial  neural networks & training them to classify visual images (e.g. \nusing Python & Tensorflow/PyTorch  \n  \n3. ETHICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES\n3.1. Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add \nthe reference to the file in KU Leuven's Record of Processing Activities. Be aware that registering \nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nYes, we use personal data. This is registered through our ethical approvals with EC and SMEC.  \nFor all studies, we obtain the names, email address, personal address, and bank account information. \nThis information is needed to pay participants.  \n3This identifiable information  is kept separate from the actual research data (see types 1-4 under Section \n2.2). The research data are coded.  \n3.2. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments \non humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant \nethical review committee(s).\nYes, there are ethical considerations, and they are covered by several ethical approvals.  \nSMEC: G-2020-2910; G-2020-2379  \nEC: S62131 \n3.3. Does your research possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and \nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and \nwhich restrictions will be asserted?\nNo \n3.4. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you \n(re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions regarding reuse and sharing are in \nplace?\nNA \n4. DOCUMENTATION AND METADATA\n4.1. What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of the data \ncollected/generated in this project?  \nThe raw data files for all four types are automatically stored with relevant meta-data.  \nFor each experiment a detailed Methods section is written that allows to replicate the experiment, and re-\nanalyze the obtained data.  \n4.2. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used. If not, \nstate in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse.\nWe use data acquisition and analysis software that is internationally used (e.g., fMRIPREP, SPM, \ncosmoMVPA toolbox), and where relevant the applicable standard data formats such as BIDS (which also  \nstandardizes directory structure & experimental information).  \n5. DATA STORAGE AND BACKUP DURING THE FWO PROJECT\n5.1. Where will the data be stored?  \nThe coded research data are stored on the professional KU Leuven Onedrive for Enterprises serves, \nusing the drive of the main experimenter per experiment (up to 3 experimenters can be involved in this \n4project). Copies can be made and kept on personal professional devices that fall under the university' \nsecure environment.  All people with access to these data use multi-factor authentication.  \n5.2. How will the data be backed up?  \nThe Onedrive assures a storage using online cloud services. In addition, the coded research data might \nbe backed-up on local external hard drives that are encrypted and password-protected.  \n5.3. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.  \nYes, the expected size of the research data is smaller than the 2 TB per person provided through \nOnedrive. \n5.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How will these \ncosts be covered? \nNo substantial costs expected, except the purchase of a few external hard drives.  \n5.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or \nmodified by unauthorized persons?  \nThe research data are always on password-protected devices. These research data are coded.   \nThe identifiable information (name, email, address) is not saved with the research data.   \nThe link between the identifiable information and the code of the research data  is stored together with the \ninformed consent form on paper (= not electronically).  This paperwork is stored in KU Leuven offices \nwithin a locked closet.  \n6. DATA PRESERVATION AFTER THE END OF THE FWO PROJECT\n6.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the project? If only  \na selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is the case (legal or contractual  \nrestrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nThe coded research data will be preserved for 10 years.  \nThe informed consents on paper will also be preserved for 10 years.  \n6.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)?  \nCurrently we archive data on a central storage RAID system of our research group when a lab member's \ncontract ends, with additional backup on encrypted & password-protected external hard drives stored in a \ndifferent building. \nTowards the end of this project, we  hope to move towards using  the university's central servers (with \nautomatic back-up procedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.  \n  \n56.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How will the costs \nbe covered? \nWith current policies, we expect a total cost of around 5 000 euro, which can be covered from a grant \navailable to the lab (C14/21/047NAFWO).\n7. DATA SHARING AND RE-USE\n7.1. Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as \ndefined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions or because of IP potential)?  \nThe research data can be shared (anonymously) with other researchers, also on online databases.  This is \nexplicitly mentioned in the informed consent forms signed by the participants.  \n7.2. Which data will be made available after the end of the project?  \nWe share the final analyses files and further experimental material (stimuli etc.) using the OSF platform.   \n7.3. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse?  \n●In an Open Access repository\nWe use the Open Science Framework.  \nPartially also by mail, because not all the raw data files might be on OSF.  \n7.4. When will the data be made available?  \n●Upon publication of the research results\n7.5. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions?  \nSummary data & analysis files and experimental  material will be fully open access for all that are \nregistered on OSF. \n7.6. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?  \nOSF has no costs (at the moment).  \n8. RESPONSIBILITIES\n8.1. Who will be responsible for the data documentation & metadata?  \nThe researchers hired on the project and the supervisor/promotor (the latter is the first contact point).  \n8.2. Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?  \nThe researchers hired on the project and the supervisor/promotor (the latter is the first contact point).  \n8.3. Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and sharing?  \nThe supervisor/promotor.  \n68.4. Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?  \nThe end responsibility for updating and implementing the DMP is with the supervisor (promotor).  "
