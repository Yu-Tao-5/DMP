STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: For descriptive content, the metadata standard is the “Library of Congress Medium of Performance Thesaurus for Music” (LCMPT) For music notation content, the metadata standard is derived from the “Josquin Project encoding standards”. If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? The primary storage location for the data will be the researcher’s personal laptop computer, which is backed up via Dropbox. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 8How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.Project data will be backed up to the KU Leuven OneDrive account. Data will also be backed up on the researcher’s personal external hard-drive on a monthly basis. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: Data for this project takes up very little storage. If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7Only I (the researcher) have physical access to my personal laptop, which is also password protected. The external hard-drive is kept in a secure location at home. The Dropbox and OneDrive accounts are also password-protected, the latter via KU Leuven Authenticator. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?No additional costs are required for data storage for this project. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 95. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).The ”Spreadsheet data” will be retained for at least five years after the research period. The “descriptive notes” will not, in their original form, be retained for five years after the research period. The “source images” will be retained for at least five years after the research period. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? The ”Spreadsheet data” will, by the end of the research period, be made freely accessible long-term online through integration with existing music databases such as “The 1520s Project” and through links to DIAMM and RISM. Although the “descriptive notes” will not necessarily be retained for five years after the research period, the findings that they contain will be preserved long-term through publication as research articles and a monograph. For the “source images”, by the end of the research project, a critical facsimile edition of major sources will be completed, published by the Alamire Foundation. The physical formal will facilitate longevity of this datatype, and the images will also be preserved online (freely accessible) as part of the IDEM database). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Costs for the storage and preservation of the “spreadsheet data” during the retention period will be covered by the researcher’s FWO bench fee. Costs for the storage of the “source images” data will be covered by the Alamire Foundation, as part of their Library of Music in Facsimile series and via their existing IDEM database. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 116. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☐ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.At “The 1520s Project” (online at https://1520s-project.org/about/ ) and at “IDEM” (online at https://www.idemdatabase.org/ ) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.Upon publication of research results, or by the end of the research period (whichever happens sooner). Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 “Spreadsheet data” will be made available under a Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY 4.0), where the data creator is myself (the researcher) “Source images” will be made available under a Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY 4.0), where the data creation is jointly credited to the Alamire Foundation and the University of Edinburgh. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes: 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Costs for sharing the “spreadsheet data” during the retention period will be covered by the researcher’s FWO bench fee. Costs sharing the “source images” data will be covered by the Alamire Foundation, as part of their Library of Music in Facsimile series and via their existing IDEM database. 7.
