The experimental methodology , used protocols and planned experiments will be stored in personal lab books ( hard cop ies) of the researchers and in word documents stored in personal KU Leuven PC s. All experimental information (date and number of experiments, description of performed experiments (experimental conditions, description of the experimental methods, outcome of obtained results )) will be documented in detail . For log -term storage an electronic copy will be collected on One Drive or one of KU Leuven online services. All experimental data collected from the various measurements will be deposited in separate folder s. All processed data of the performed experiments (a part of subprojects ) will be collected as well . The new folders will be created in a case of publication of the papers , allowing the access of the published data in single location. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used.

CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 7 All KU Leuven services are personally authorized . The access is available only to researchers who have authorization . All data will be protected by the researcher’s personal password. For subprojects which are planned to be done in collaboration with the other groups , only data of interest for both groups will be shared . 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11 What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Microsoft OneDrive License is free of charge for all KU Leuven researcher s. Archival data storage is centrally offered via KU Leuven on the University's servers. Additionally, the data can be saved at the HDD provided by the LBC laboratory . 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). All collected and used data during FWO project will be stored at the Research Data Respiratory (RDR) of KU Leuven. Also, the copy of the data will be stored on an external HDD provided by LBC group . The lab notebook s will be stored in the physical archive and will be available to the PI of the project . Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? The data will be stored on the University's central servers (with automatic back -up procedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. The HDD of the LBC lab will be used as well. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Data archival at KU Leuven is currently offered at 270 Euro/TB/year. 1TB of storage will be sufficient and the price for storage for 10 years is 2700 Euro. These costs will be covered by the budget of the LBC research group. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE , CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY . AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS .

All data will be available on OneDrive folder and LBC group’s HDD for their future use and comparison with other results. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. The date obtained during the project will be available after the publication process, while the other , non - published data will be available to the researchers who have the access to the OneDrive folder and group’s HDD. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify : Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. All data obtained in this project will be available on OneDrive folder and group’s HDD , providing the access to the researchers who work together on the same project. However, t he date will be available to the public after the publication process . FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13 When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’. The data will be available after publication process . However, all data will be stored on OneDrive folder and group’s HDD and will be available just to the researchers who work on the same project. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS . IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED , THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED .

EXAMPLE ANSWER : E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS .” 8 The obtained results will be available for public after publication process in peer reviewed journals. The publications will be stored in digital repository of KU Leuven Association (LIRIAS; https://limo.libis.be/ ). The non-published results will not be public, but the research team will have an access . Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here . INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA . ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes: The publications with appropriate DOI number will be stored in digital repository of KU Leuven Association (LIRIAS; https://limo.libis.be/ ). 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14 What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Publishing in the most peer review journals is free of charge . In case of publications fee, cover pages fee, the cost will be covered by the granted FWO bench fee. 7. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project? The researcher s/project leaders will be responsible for data collection . Also, their responsibility is to provide the exact documentation. Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project? The researchers/project leaders will manage storing the data in OneDrive and a lab notebook and word documents will be stored in the personnel researcher’s KU Leuven PC during the project. Who will manage data preservation and sharing? Prof. Parac -Vogt (PI) will be responsible for ensuring the preservation and reuse of the data generated during the project. Who will update and implement this DMP? The PI has the main responsibility for updating & implementing DMP."
