Single cell RNA sequencing data\nby the Tejpar group led to identification of defects both in CD4 and CD8 T cells in MSS CRC which\nmay indicate that ineffective priming and activation of T cells by dendritic cells underlies the lack\nof cytotoxic CD8 T cells and response to immunotherapy. The Tejpar group showed\nheterogeneity across tumor subsets where most MSS lack Th1 and CD8 T effector cells, but for\ninstance CMS2 and CMS4 are enriched in Th17 and Treg, respectively, pointing to imbalances in\nCD4 and CD8 T cells at different levels per subtype. This heterogeneity should not be ignored\nwhen attempting to drive T cell balances to favorable Th1 and cytotoxic CD8 responses. In\naddition, successful activation of cytotoxic T cells can also be hampered by the basal tolerogenic\ninteractions in the colon during homeostasis, implying the importance of studying the disease\northotopically. Therefore, I aim to characterize and manipulate CD4 and CD8 T cell (dys)functions\nin orthotopic patient-matched CRC models, which can suggest novel therapeutic interventions.\nMoreover, will provide clinically relevant colorectal tumor models with a robust interrogation\ntoolset for phenotyping and tracking of tumor-specific immune responses.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nIn this project, I plan to collect genomics/transcriptomics (single cell and bulk), peptidomics and\nimmunophenotypic data for MC38, KPN, BMT, AKPT cell lines in CRC CMS specific models.\nMoreover, we will identify novel and CMS model specific epitopes serving as very valuable tools\nin future. From these, we will\nbuild correlations and aim to generate appropriate manuscripts, describing the insights on the\nnative MC38 as well as other cell line models, the effect of treatments on this model and in\ncollaboration with Prof Sansom, we will describe unique CMS models. For translation of mouse to\nhuman research, this project has\naccess to the group's extensive bulk and scRNAseq database.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 5\nType of data\nFormat\nVolume\nHow\nCreated\nSingle cell genomics\ndata\nfastq,\nbam\n3-10TB\n10X\nGenomics\ntechnology\n& Illumina\nsequencing\nMulti-region whole\nexome sequencing\n(Illumina)\nfastq,\nbam\n3-10TB\nIllumina\nsequencing\nbulk RNA\nsequencing\nfastq,\nbam\n3-10TB\nIllumina\nsequencing\nImmunopeptidomics\nfastq,\nbam\n3-10TB\nProteins will\nbe islodate\nfrom fresh-\nfrozen\ntissue &\nMHC1/MHC2\n3.

If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nYes\nECD Approval has been granted: P194/2021\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nYes\nWe do not exclude that the proposed work could result in research data with potential for tech\ntransfer and valorization.

Samson, Janssen Pharmaceutics and the SIB (swiss institute for bio-\ninformatics) for this project.\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nYes\nA data access agreement is in place. This agreement relates to the primary sequencing data and\nany secondary analysis results. Any public\ndisclosure on new data on this project needs to follow a disclosure process.\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nFor the survey data a codebook will be generated containing study design, sampling\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 5\nmethodology, variable-level information (lael, question\ntext, codes, frequencies). All of the metadata of the different cohorts will be stored and encoded\nin an electronic labbook / excel.\nFor further analysis: Software, algorithms and scripts will be commented and extensively\ndocumented, e.g. using Jupyter Notebooks and R\nMarkdown. Software will be version-controlled and tracked using git via version numbers, tags\nand commit IDs (hashes).

All the raw sequencing data as well as\nsecondary analysis results are stored both\nuniversity's central servers and the vlaamse supercomputer (VSC). This includes automatic daily\nback- up procedures. After publication, all\nsupporting data is deposited into an access-controlled public repository such as the European\nGenome-Phenome Archive (EGA).\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nAll the raw sequencing data as well as secondary analysis results are stored both university's\ncentral servers and the vlaamse\nsupercomputer (VSC).\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project?

These are\nexpandable in blocks, the backup capacity is\ntechnically not an issue.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nThe L-drive (big storage capacity drive of the KUL) charges 570 euros for every 5TB. These costs\nare covered by credits of the DIO-lab.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nAnonymized data is stored on the VSC protected by their security policy. Measurements are\ntaking to ensure the security of the data storage\nand to prevent modification by unauthorized persons.\n6.
