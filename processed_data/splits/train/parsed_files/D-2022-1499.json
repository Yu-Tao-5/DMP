Abdominal pain is a hallmark of IBS and results from the mast cell-mediated\nsensitization of afferent nerves, leading to aberrant intestinal pain perception. Recently, we\nprovided evidence that a local immune response against dietary antigens underlies the\ndevelopment of abdominal pain in IBS. However, the mechanisms and the dynamics leading to\nthis immune response remain unknown. We hypothesize that early signals produced by the\nepithelium in response to IBS triggers, like infectious gastroenteritis or psychological stress,\ninitiate a local pro-Th2 immune environment in the intestine. This ultimately induces a local type\n2 immune response to food antigens and food-induced abdominal pain. In the present project, we\naim to unravel the immune mechanisms that cause the loss of tolerance to dietary antigens and\nlead to pain in IBS, in response to infection or psychological stress, in order to ultimately improve\nclinical management of the disease. The outcome of this project will be important to uncover the\nimmune dynamics underlying the initiation of IBS and will ultimately lead to more efficient\ntreatment strategies for IBS.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
