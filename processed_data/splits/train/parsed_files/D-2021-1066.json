Regarding this debate, late medieval\nthinkers made a remarkable contribution with long-lasting influences on Modern thought. The\naim of the project is to shed new light on the mathematical approach by which the medievals\nquestioned a central problem in natural philosophy, i.e. the nature of continuum. \nIn the 13th and\n14th century, two opposite tenets were advanced by Aristotelians and atomists. In accordance\nwith Aristotleâ€™s thought, the former accounted for the infinite divisibility of everything within\nspace, whereas the latter held to the existence of indivisible elements composing the continuum.\nGeometrical reasoning enlivened late medieval discussions on the nature of extension. A pivotal\nrole in the development of geometrical arguments was played by De lineis insecabilibus, a\ngeometrical text which was wrongly ascribed to Aristotle and had a great popularity throughout\nthe Middle Ages. The research will offer a thorough analysis of the geometrical arguments\nemployed by late medieval philosophers, retracing the medieval roots of the philosophical\ndiscussion of the geometric space. The first critical edition of De lineis insecabilibus will be\nproduced and its impact on Latin atomism evaluated, and further evidence in support of the\nattribution of its Latin translation to the 13th-century polymath Robert Grosseteste will be\nprovided.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
