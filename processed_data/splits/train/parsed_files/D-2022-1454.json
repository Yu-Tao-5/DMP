Their vows to the bishop, however,\nrequired them to be discreet about belonging to this international community, an unrecognized\nnetwork of likeminded women striving to transform both church and society according to\nChristian humanistic principles. The proposed project will study this network in the\ntransformative 1950s up to the 1970s by mapping the movement and its links to ecclesial and\nsocietal organizations, by rediscovering their voice and ideas as â€˜travelling conceptsâ€™\nbetween theological, gender and social frameworks, and by assessing through historical network\nresearch the effect of this movement on social and ecclesial organizations in a Belgian and\ninternational context. Given the confidential character of their vocation, it will be essential to\naugment social-conceptual history with historical network research and oral history so as to\ngrasp the full impact of the Auxilium women on church and society.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
