Extensive and costly hard-machining or green machining, before a\nfinal sintering step, requiring a green body with sufficiently high green strength, are required. The current proposal aims at reducing or even\neliminating post machining operations and integrating multiple functionalities within a single, geometrically-complex part by the development of\nmultimaterials and/or functionally graded materials, exhibiting a gradient in microstructure, composition or a combination thereof. The targeted multi-\nmaterial components and associated manufacturing strategies are expected to demonstrate clear added value, lower production cost and improved\nperformance compared to their monolithic counterparts.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n16-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Yes, intellectual property rights Every PhD student will contact the corresponding supervisor of the PhD thesis prior to dissemination of project results into the public domain. The PhD supervisor will give permission for dissemination (or not), depending on the valorization viability of the obtained project results. In case the project result has high valorization potential, IP protection by patent filing will be performed. Where will the data be made available? Where will the data be made available?

What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? So far the costs are unknown. The estimated amount of data that will be stored in repositories will be max 10 TB. The current cost to deposit data at Large Volume Storage accounts for € 104,42 / TB / year. During the project, these costs will be covered by the project budget. The (co)supervisors will discuss which and how many data will be stored on a longer term. Additionally, it will be discussed who and how the concomitant costs will be covered.
