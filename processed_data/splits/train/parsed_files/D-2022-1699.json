This review is currently submitted for publication.\n- We will extract data from electronic patient records (EHRs) in this study, both in the University Psychiatry Hospitals in UPC KU Leuven campus Kortenberg, and UPC Duffel. \nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when\nappropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number.\nYes, human subject data (Provide SMEC or EC approval number below)\nFor the focus groups, interviews and workshops, we obtained approval of the EC UZ Leuven under the number S66783. \nFor the feasibility study, we will submit a protocol to obtain ethical approval by November 2023. We first need the results of the first phases of the research project to be able to design the\nintervention, and thus the feasibility and mixed methods evaluation. \nThe protocol of the CCT will be written at the end of the feasibility study.\nWill you process personal data? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S\nnumber).\nYes (Provide PRET G-number or EC S-number below)\nS66783\n+ approval for feasibility study and CCT to be obtained later\nDoes your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)?

We will use Atlas.ti web version because this enables\nresearchers to work together on a project in the cloud. (not possible with the NVivo version at KU Leuven) We will document the meaning of the codes, and make a list of our files. \n- For the patient questionnaires, we will code every question as a variable. For every variable, we will define measurement units, missing data, and assign labels. These questionnaires will be\ngiven to patients on paper. Details about these questionnaires will be available later in the research project. The choice of questionnaires still can change, according to the results of the first\nphases of the project. \nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to \nfind and reuse the data\n?  \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. \nIf not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. \nNo\nData Storage & Back-up during the Research Project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nShared network drive (J-drive)\nOther (specify below)\nRedcap, a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and databases. \nHow will the data be backed up?\nStandard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? \nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, explain how this will be taken care of. \nYes\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? \nAll digital data will be stored on the Shared Network Drive of KU Leuven or in the Redcap project software. Only the members of the research team will have access to the research data via their\nKUL username and password.\nAll physical data will be stored in labelled boxes in the archive of the Academic Center for General Practice at KU Leuven, which is a locked room.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project?

How will these costs be covered?\nOnly Redcap license costs €80 per year. The project lasts 6 years, thus this will cost €480.\nThis cost is foreseen in the project budget.\nData Sharing and Reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  \nPlease explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available.\nNo (closed access)\nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. \nThe data will be accessible for the PI (Mieke Vermandere), the two PhD-students who will work on the project (Laura Tops, and the second one still to appoint), and the study nurse (also needs to\nbe appointed in a later phase).\nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? \nPlease explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nYes, privacy aspects\nAll data will be handled with full confidentiality during the project. No personal data will be misused and only the information provided by respecting the law on the protection of privacy (08.12.92)\nwill be stored. All personal information of the participants will be pseudonymised, and the collected data will only be used for data analysis related to this study purposes. Each participant will\nreceive a numeric code. This code will only be used to link the research data to the demographic data, but not to identify the participants afterwards. After the data analysis, audio recordings will\nbe destroyed. We will save the names and e-mail addresses of the participants (on the secured KU Leuven server) to send them the research paper(s) once it is published, but we will not save a\nkey to link these names and e-mail addresses to the research data or the numeric codes of participants. Therefore, this is an anonymization process, and not a pseudonymisation.
