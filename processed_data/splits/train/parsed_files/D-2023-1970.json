Results from largescale genetic studies strongly implicate\nabnormal synaptic organization and inhibitory signaling in the pathophysiology of ASD. To date, the research on ASD has been neuron-\ncentric. However, astrocytes, a type of glial cell, closely interact with neurons and play a critical role in the formation and function of\nsynapses. Recent work suggests that excitatory and inhibitory synapse formation and function are differentially regulated by astrocytes.\nMy goal is to gain fundamental knowledge on the composition and function of the inhibitory synapse and the role this may play in ASD.\nFor this, I will use a novel proximity biotinylation-based approach to identify astrocyte proteins, previously linked with ASD, which are\npresent at the inhibitory synapse. I will then assess the role of these proteins using a loss-of-function approach combined with testing for\nstructural and functional effects on synapse formation, and by performing extensive in vivo behavioral phenotyping for ASD. Establishing\na key role for astrocytes in controlling synapse-specific wiring and function would constitute a novel important finding that would spark\nintensive research in the ASD field, with important consequences for human disease research.\nLast modified: \n12-05-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

This\nwill allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse.\n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nAll electronic files (text documents, images, sequences) will be stored on KU\nLeuven servers, with hourly on-site backup and mirroring or stored on a cloud-based\nservice offered by KU Leuven (OneDrive). In addition data will be regularly backed-up\nand stored on an external hard drive.\nAll physical samples will be stored as appropriate:\nNucleic acids, viral vectors, protein samples will be stored at -80°C with appropriate backup copies of the stock in the PI lab at KU Leuven.\nVectors: as a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer). All published vectors and the\nassociated sequences will be sent to the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request.\nOther biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nUse of standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS: data will be stored on the OneDrive for Business cloud storage, which is synced approximately every 10 minutes. KU Leuven servers have\nhourly on-site backup and mirroring.\nAdditionally, backup to external hard drives will be performed once every 3 months. \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThe OneDrive for Business cloud storage provided by KU Leuven ICTS provides 2TB of storage data, which should be sufficient for the data generated in the project.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nBoth the “L-drive” (Large Volume Storage) and “J-drive” (Shared Network Drive) servers by KU Leuven ICTS are accessible only by laboratory members, and are mirrored in the second ICTS\ndatacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery, so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour.\nThe project does not involve the use of sensitive personal data.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nThe total amount of digital data associated with the project is expected to be around\n2TB. The cost for storage of 1TB data per year on the KU Leuven ICTS “L-drive” (Large Volume Storage) server is approximately € 104,42 / TB / year.\nThe PI and the lab manager if applicable are responsible for the preservation of the mouse lines, as well as administrative and experimental data.\nThe mouse lines used in the project will be cryopreserved after the end of the project (Mouse Expertise Unit of VIB-KU Leuven: exact costs are to be determined, but usually they range from a few\nhundred to several thousand euros). All published lines will be preserved for the remainder of the PI’s research career. All unpublished lines will be preserved for a minimum of 5 years after the\nend of the project.\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be\npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\nThe minimum preservation period of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to\nall datasets.\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nAs a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via\nexisting platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at\nthe time of publication.\nFor all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows:\nDigital datasets: files will be stored on the “L-drive” (Large Volume Storage) server of KU Leuven ICTS;\nUsed or Novel transgenic mouse lines will be kept locally in the animal facility or cryopreserved;\nBiological samples (protein, DNA samples, etc.) will be stored locally in the\nlaboratory freezers;\nImmunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence stained samples (on mounted slides) will be stored locally in the laboratory fridges -or freezers using appropriate cryoprotectants-;\nTissue samples will be stored locally in the laboratory freezers/fridges;\nOmics data: datasets will be stored on the “L-drive” (Large Volume Storage) server of KU Leuven ICTS;\nNucleic acid vectors: As a general rule, at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector in the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer);\nOther biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples\nin cryovials locally in the laboratory freezers as appropriate.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 12 May 2023\n9 of 11\nThe costs of the storage of 1-2 TB data for 5 years on KU Leuven servers are maximally €1500. The cost of storage of cryopreserved mouse lines is estimated to be around €2000 euros over 5\nyears. These costs will be met partially by the bench fee provided by the FWO and partially by existing lab grants.\n5. Data sharing and reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made\navailable.\nYes, in an Open Access repository\nParticipants to the present project are committed to publish research results to communicate them to peers and to a wider audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made\nopenly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new collaborators, or\npublicly via repositories. Clearly, metadata will be openly available, as is typically the case for metadata access.\nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.\nFor data managed and shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe\nthe types of data access and reuse that are permitted.\nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment\nsection per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nNo\nWhere will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.\nThe data will be made available:\nIn an Open Access repository\nUpon request by mail\nOther (specified here):\nAs a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible via existing platforms that\nsupport FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org). Sharing policies for specific\nresearch outputs are detailed here below:\nOmics datasets: These will be deposited in open access repositories such as the PRIDE Archive for proteomics data.\nVectors: Upon publication, all vectors supporting a manuscript will be made\npublicly available via the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, along with the\ncorresponding DNA sequences. Addgene in turns performs quality control on the\nDNA, curates the plasmids online with all relevant information (maps,\nsequences), and for a minimal cost (typically $65) ships the vectors upon simple\nrequest and signature of a material transfer agreement (MTA). The MTA will be\nprepared before depositing the vectors with the help of the KU Leuven Research & Development - Tech Transfer Office. For transfer between nonprofit or academic institutions, Addgene\ntypically uses the Uniform Biological Material Transfer Agreement (https://www.addgene.org/terms/1047/). All non-published vectors and the associated documentation will be shared by the\nPI upon request and after signature of a material transfer agreement, at no cost except the cost of shipment.\nGenetically modified organisms: All genetically modified mouse lines used in\npublications will be made available to researchers upon request at the time of\npublication. Transgenic mouse lines will be kept locally in the animal facility or cryopreserved, and samples will be sent to requesting researchers for a nominal processing fee.\nOther digital datasets that support publications (including image, video or audio\nfiles, electrophysiology data, spectroscopy data, behavioral data) will be made publicly available via an open research data platform such as\nMendeley Data or Zenodo.\nAntibodies, synthetic and recombinant compounds: Samples will be stored as\nappropriate in the laboratory. Within availability, they will be shared with interested researchers upon request.\nResearch documentation: All protocols used to generate published data will be\ndescribed in the corresponding manuscript(s), and the related documentation will\nbe included as supplementary information. These data and all other documents\n(daily logs, raw data) are accessible to the PI and the research staff, and will be\nmade available upon request.\nManuscripts: All scientific publications will be shared openly. Manuscripts\nsubmitted for publication will be deposited in a preprint server such as bioRxiv,\narXiv, or ASAPbio. At the time of publication, research\nresults will be summarized on the PI’s website and postprint\npdf versions of publications will be made available there if allowed by\ncopyright agreements, possibly after an embargo as determined by the publisher.\nBefore the end of the embargo or in cases where sharing the postprint is not\nallowed due to copyright agreements, a preprint version of the manuscript will\nbe made available. Publications will also be automatically listed in the institutional academic database of the KU Leuven Association, Lirias 2.0, based on the authors name and ORCID ID.\nData that do not support publication: These will be either deposited in an open access repository or made available upon request by email.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nThe data will be made available:\nImmediately after the end of the project\nAfter an embargo period, if necessary\nUpon publication of the research results\nAs a general rule, all research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at the time of publication. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed, e.g. by pending publications, potential\nIP requirements – note that patent application filing will be planned so that publications need not be delayed - or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be made\npublicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached.\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

    "clean_full_text": "The astrocyte-specific proteome in inhibitory tripartite synapse formation and function in the context of Autism Spectrum Disorder - FWO 11M4323N DMP A Data Management Plan created using DMPonline.be Creator: Domenico Natale Affiliation: KU Leuven (KUL) Funder: Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) Template: FWO DMP (Flemish Standard DMP) Grant number / URL: 11M4323N ID: 199316 Start date: 01-11-2022 End date: 01-11-2027 Project abstract: The neurobiology underlying Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) remains elusive. Results from largescale genetic studies strongly implicate abnormal synaptic organization and inhibitory signaling in the pathophysiology of ASD. To date, the research on ASD has been neuron- centric. However, astrocytes, a type of glial cell, closely interact with neurons and play a critical role in the formation and function of synapses. Recent work suggests that excitatory and inhibitory synapse formation and function are differentially regulated by astrocytes. My goal is to gain fundamental knowledge on the composition and function of the inhibitory synapse and the role this may play in ASD. For this, I will use a novel proximity biotinylation-based approach to identify astrocyte proteins, previously linked with ASD, which are present at the inhibitory synapse. I will then assess the role of these proteins using a loss-of-function approach combined with testing for structural and functional effects on synapse formation, and by performing extensive in vivo behavioral phenotyping for ASD. Establishing a key role for astrocytes in controlling synapse-specific wiring and function would constitute a novel important finding that would spark intensive research in the ASD field, with important consequences for human disease research.

This file will be located in the top level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used. This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? All electronic files (text documents, images, sequences) will be stored on KU Leuven servers, with hourly on-site backup and mirroring or stored on a cloud-based service offered by KU Leuven (OneDrive). In addition data will be regularly backed-up and stored on an external hard drive. All physical samples will be stored as appropriate: Nucleic acids, viral vectors, protein samples will be stored at -80°C with appropriate backup copies of the stock in the PI lab at KU Leuven. Vectors: as a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer). All published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request. Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate. How will the data be backed up? Use of standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS: data will be stored on the OneDrive for Business cloud storage, which is synced approximately every 10 minutes. KU Leuven servers have hourly on-site backup and mirroring. Additionally, backup to external hard drives will be performed once every 3 months. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes The OneDrive for Business cloud storage provided by KU Leuven ICTS provides 2TB of storage data, which should be sufficient for the data generated in the project. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Both the “L-drive” (Large Volume Storage) and “J-drive” (Shared Network Drive) servers by KU Leuven ICTS are accessible only by laboratory members, and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery, so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. The project does not involve the use of sensitive personal data. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The total amount of digital data associated with the project is expected to be around 2TB. The cost for storage of 1TB data per year on the KU Leuven ICTS “L-drive” (Large Volume Storage) server is approximately € 104,42 / TB / year. The PI and the lab manager if applicable are responsible for the preservation of the mouse lines, as well as administrative and experimental data. The mouse lines used in the project will be cryopreserved after the end of the project (Mouse Expertise Unit of VIB-KU Leuven: exact costs are to be determined, but usually they range from a few hundred to several thousand euros). All published lines will be preserved for the remainder of the PI’s research career. All unpublished lines will be preserved for a minimum of 5 years after the end of the project. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). The minimum preservation period of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of publication. For all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows: Digital datasets: files will be stored on the “L-drive” (Large Volume Storage) server of KU Leuven ICTS; Used or Novel transgenic mouse lines will be kept locally in the animal facility or cryopreserved; Biological samples (protein, DNA samples, etc.) will be stored locally in the laboratory freezers; Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence stained samples (on mounted slides) will be stored locally in the laboratory fridges -or freezers using appropriate cryoprotectants-; Tissue samples will be stored locally in the laboratory freezers/fridges; Omics data: datasets will be stored on the “L-drive” (Large Volume Storage) server of KU Leuven ICTS; Nucleic acid vectors: As a general rule, at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector in the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer); Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials locally in the laboratory freezers as appropriate. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 12 May 2023 9 of 11 The costs of the storage of 1-2 TB data for 5 years on KU Leuven servers are maximally €1500. The cost of storage of cryopreserved mouse lines is estimated to be around €2000 euros over 5 years. These costs will be met partially by the bench fee provided by the FWO and partially by existing lab grants. 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in an Open Access repository Participants to the present project are committed to publish research results to communicate them to peers and to a wider audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made openly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new collaborators, or publicly via repositories. Clearly, metadata will be openly available, as is typically the case for metadata access. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. For data managed and shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of data access and reuse that are permitted. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. No Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. The data will be made available: In an Open Access repository Upon request by mail Other (specified here): As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org). Sharing policies for specific research outputs are detailed here below: Omics datasets: These will be deposited in open access repositories such as the PRIDE Archive for proteomics data. Vectors: Upon publication, all vectors supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, along with the corresponding DNA sequences. Addgene in turns performs quality control on the DNA, curates the plasmids online with all relevant information (maps, sequences), and for a minimal cost (typically $65) ships the vectors upon simple request and signature of a material transfer agreement (MTA). The MTA will be prepared before depositing the vectors with the help of the KU Leuven Research & Development - Tech Transfer Office. For transfer between nonprofit or academic institutions, Addgene typically uses the Uniform Biological Material Transfer Agreement (https://www.addgene.org/terms/1047/). All non-published vectors and the associated documentation will be shared by the PI upon request and after signature of a material transfer agreement, at no cost except the cost of shipment. Genetically modified organisms: All genetically modified mouse lines used in publications will be made available to researchers upon request at the time of publication. Transgenic mouse lines will be kept locally in the animal facility or cryopreserved, and samples will be sent to requesting researchers for a nominal processing fee. Other digital datasets that support publications (including image, video or audio files, electrophysiology data, spectroscopy data, behavioral data) will be made publicly available via an open research data platform such as Mendeley Data or Zenodo. Antibodies, synthetic and recombinant compounds: Samples will be stored as appropriate in the laboratory. Within availability, they will be shared with interested researchers upon request. Research documentation: All protocols used to generate published data will be described in the corresponding manuscript(s), and the related documentation will be included as supplementary information. These data and all other documents (daily logs, raw data) are accessible to the PI and the research staff, and will be made available upon request. Manuscripts: All scientific publications will be shared openly. Manuscripts submitted for publication will be deposited in a preprint server such as bioRxiv, arXiv, or ASAPbio. At the time of publication, research results will be summarized on the PI’s website and postprint pdf versions of publications will be made available there if allowed by copyright agreements, possibly after an embargo as determined by the publisher. Before the end of the embargo or in cases where sharing the postprint is not allowed due to copyright agreements, a preprint version of the manuscript will be made available. Publications will also be automatically listed in the institutional academic database of the KU Leuven Association, Lirias 2.0, based on the authors name and ORCID ID. Data that do not support publication: These will be either deposited in an open access repository or made available upon request by email. When will the data be made available? The data will be made available: Immediately after the end of the project After an embargo period, if necessary Upon publication of the research results As a general rule, all research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at the time of publication. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed, e.g. by pending publications, potential IP requirements – note that patent application filing will be planned so that publications need not be delayed - or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be made publicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 12 May 2023 10 of 11 Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse, and will conform to community norms. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication (CC0), a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY), or an ODC Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL), with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. Yes As stated above, interested parties will be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? From the start of the project, data management costs will be minimized by implementing standard procedures, e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization, and by using free-to- use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. When sharing and shipping physical data, substantial costs will be paid by the researcher colleagues requesting the materials. The laboratory budget will cover the costs associated with general data management and sharing. 6. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project? Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the laboratory notebook that refer to specific datasets, and additionally compiling applicable metadata along with the data in the manner described above. Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project? The research and technical staff will ensure data storage and backup, with support from technical staff and IT administrators for the KU Leuven drives. Who will manage data preservation and sharing? The PI is responsible for long-term data preservation and sharing, with support from the research and technical staff involved in the project, and from technical stuff and IT administrators for the KU Leuven drives. Who will update and implement this DMP? The PI bears the end responsibility of updating and implementing this DMP. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 12 May 2023 11 of 11"
