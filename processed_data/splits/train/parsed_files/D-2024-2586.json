A key parameter in the remodeling\nprocess is myocardial stiffness, which currently cannot be measured non-invasively in clinical practice. For this purpose, ultrasound shear wave\nelastography has shown tremendous potential, but the main question remains whether the technique is able to distinguish intrinsic stiffening (possibly\nnon-reversible) from functional stiffening (reversible). To interpret shear wave elastography measurements with respect to its mechanical confounders,\nthis project aims to further advance the finite element model developed in my junior FWO postdoc by accounting for the effects of contractility,\nviscoelasticity and a realistic natural wave excitation source (realistic cardiac morphology). Complementary to these simulations, we will perform 3D\nshear wave elastography measurements in healthy volunteers and patients with varying degrees of stenosis to get better insights into the natural wave\nphysics, and subsequently put forward the preferred imaging technology (2D/3D) with optimized settings for robust and reliable results. Based on the\nexperiments and modeling results, a new measurement protocol (with new metrics) will be proposed to pinpoint intrinsic stiffness changes. This\nprotocol will be tested in vivo to assess its feasibility, sensitivity and robustness for myocardial stiffness assessment. \nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n30-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Last modiﬁed 30 April 2024 4 of 6 actual data). Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Experimental data: Human data: for the first 5 years after the end of the project, the data will remained stored on the UZ leuven server. After that, the responsible needs to decide if further storage is necessary. Non-human data will be archived at KU Leuven RDR or Large Volume Storage or online repositories (e.g. Zenodo). Simulation data will be archived on the UGent network server or on online repositories (e.g. Zenodo). What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The main cost would be associated with storage of the human data, as this needs to be stored securely. Here, we foresee a total of 2000 EUR (2 TB at a cost of 400 EUR/year). This cost will be covered by the research group. 5. Data sharing and reuse 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?

What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? The expected costs are yet to be determined, depending on data size. At the KU Leuven RDR, every researcher can store 50GB per year for free. Also, online platforms like Zenodo allow to store 50 GB per record for free. 6. Responsibilities 6.
