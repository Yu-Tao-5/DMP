GUIDANCE: The data description forms the basis of your entire DMP, so make sure it is detailed and complete. It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all materials that need proper management because they are valuable, difficult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentation/metadata. RDM Guidance on data If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type. Data about chemical procedures developed by others inside or outside of the research group will be reused to obtain the desired compounds. This will be obtained either from published papers or procedures described in the online or physical lab notebooks. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 7Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number.☐ Yes, human subject data; provide SMEC or EC approval number: ☐ Yes, animal data; provide ECD reference number: ☐ Yes, dual use; provide approval number: ☒ No Additional information: Will you process personal data4? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number).☐ Yes (provide PRET G-number or EC S-number below) ☒ No Additional information: Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin- offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please comment: -BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION DATA: the described compounds are foreseen to be active as kinase inhibitors and have potential applications in treating a variety of cancers, viral infections and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the valorization potential of this work is high with the biological evaluation data playing a key role in the assessment of how potent obtained compounds are. -PROCEDURES ON CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS: synthetic procedures toward the potent compounds. -CHARACTERIZATION DATA: all the data proving the structure of compounds (NMR, HRMS, IR, X-ray data, etc.) being essential for the development of further application. 4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 8Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3.Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .Two types of data will be gathered during this project. Chemical data from experiments (reaction conditions, experimental sequence, observations, amount of reagents used) will be stored by the researcher in Microsoft OneDrive (2 TB), MBook ELN(Electronic Lab Notebooks) and analogue lab notebooks. Corresponding structural identification data for the obtained compounds (raw and processed) will be uploaded in the ELN and linked to the correct experiment making data traceable. Biological data will include information on kinase inhibition and will be preserved digitally and shared among all collaborators. All project data will be shared with the PI and other collaborators via Microsoft OneDrive and via the ELN. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: Metadata will be saved in the OneDrive storage and will be reported in the ELN. Filenames of the data generated (raw and processed) will be annotated in the ELN as well. 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data.☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☒ Other: Analogue notebooks, MBook online lab notebook, physical storage for generated compounds. How will the data be backed up?

FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No KU Leuven OneDrive provides space of 2 TB which is regularly backed up and can be extended if needed. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data OneDrive is not publicly accessible and password protected. Access needs to be granted by the researcher and will be limited to the PI (and his delegate responsible for data storage). For collaborations, accessibility to the relevant files will be granted if described in a non-disclosure agreement. Archival storage at KU Leuven is not publicly accessible and only people with permission (PI and his delegate responsible for data storage) can access the data. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?The use of OneDrive is free of charge if the capacity of 2 TB is not exceeded. Archival data storage is centrally offered via KU Leuven at 270 Euro/TB/Year. MBook ELN and the cloud service are offered by Mestrelab at 10 Euro/month for the subscription and a one-time license fee of 120 Euro. These costs are being covered by the general operating budget of the research group, or by the individual bench fee of researchers. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): Data will be stored on the KU Leuven central servers for at least 10 years (with automatic back-up procedures), conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. LIRIAS for publications, cloud storage for ELN, physical copies stored in the office of the PI. Also, the data that is disclosed in the supporting information of publications will be stored permanently. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Data archival at KU Leuven is currently offered at 270 Euro/TB/year. Since no large datasets are generated in this project, one TB of storage will be sufficient and the price for storage for 10 years is 2700 Euro. These costs are covered by the general operating budget of the research group or by the individual bench fee of researchers. 6.
