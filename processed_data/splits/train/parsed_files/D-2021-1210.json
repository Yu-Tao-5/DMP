An amendement for the data of WP 2  was\nsubmitted on 19th October 2022. \nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used:\nAdministrative data on hospital visits and all healthcare related costs will be collected\nthrough the InterMutualistic Agency. Medication use will be collected from the patient or\ncaregiver\ninterview and the electronic health record. The majority of patient characteristics will also be\ncollected from the electronic health record:, age, sex, body mass index, weight, serum\ncreatinine, creatinine clearance, hemoglobin levels, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate\ntransaminase, potassium, HbA1c, systolic blood pressure and left ventricle ejection fraction, the\ntotal number of comorbidities and specific co-morbidities such as systolic heart failure, atrial\nfibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, arrhythmia,\ndementia, diagnosis of coronary artery disease, stroke, cancer, peripheral artery disease, chronic\nkidney disease and orthostatic hypotension. Other administrative data such as reason for\nadmission, admission source (e.g. home, nursing home), discharge destination, responsible\nperson (mainly or partly) for the medication management process, surgery during hospitalization,\nstay on the intensive care unit during the hospitalization, admission to another ward before\nadmission to the acute geriatric ward, length of stay, the Charlson Comorbidity Score, Mini\nMental State Examination and the clinical frailty score will also be collected. Patient reported data\nsuch as patient preferences, quality of life, medication adherence will be collected during the\ninclusion interview, by follow-up telephone calls and from a patient diary.\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nYes\nOur prospective randomized controlled trial has obtained ethical approval by the Ethics\nCommittee of Research UZ/KU Leuven \n(S64758)\n. An amendement for the data of WP 2 was\nsubmitted on 19th October 2022.The GDPR questionnaire of the CTC was submitted and\napproved.\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nFor each WP meta-data will be available and stored on the secured server of the hospital.\nMore precisely, meta-data will be provided by 1. EC approval, Data management plan, and Data\nAppendix (REDCap) or Interview Guide, 2. preparation and cleaning of the data, 3. analyses of the\ndata. \nWhen using REDCap, a Data Dictionary Codebook will be generated which includes information\non variable level for all collected data. \nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nSince we will be working with sensitive personal data, the data will be stored in the hospital's\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 5\nsecure environment for private data. All data will be password-secured. \nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe data will be stored in REDCap and on the hospital's central servers with automatic daily\nback-up procedures. \n \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nREDCap provides unlimited capacity and is hosted on central webservices of KU Leuven. \nThe available capacity of the UZ Leuven servers is XX. Given the nature of our research, we\nexpect this capacity to be sufficient for all data storage. \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nThe yearly cost of using REDCap is 80 euros/year, this cost is coverd by the PI. The use of UZ\nLeuven servers is free of charge. \nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nPatient-related information is stored in a password-protected folder on the servers of UZ Leuven.\nOnly investigators have access to this folder. Included patients receive an unique identification-\nnumber and this number is used in REDCap â„¢. So, only anonymised data will be entered in\nREDCap.\n \n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll data will be retained for at least 5 years.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nThe data will be stored on the UZ Leuven central servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for\nat least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nAfter entering data in REDCap, all data will be downloaded from REDCap and be stored on the\nservers of UZ Leuven. Therefore, the yearly cost of using REDCap will no longer be applicable\nafterward and no extra fee is charged for using the servers of UZ Leuven.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nYes. Specify:\nWe collect patient-related information, therefore datasharing is restricted. Moreover, participants\ndid not give consent for data sharing. \nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nWe collect patient-related information so data will not be freely available. Upon reasonable\nrequest, anonymised data can be made available.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nData will be available on reasonable request after signing a data sharing agreement. \nWhen will the data be made available?\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 5\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nData sharing will be considered after a reasonable request is submitted explaining the planned\nreuse. Only uses for research purposes will be allowed and commercial reuse will be excluded.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nWe expect no costs for data sharing\n8. Responsibilities\nWho will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?\n2 PhD students (Laura Hellemans and Julie Hias) will be responsible for data documentation and\nmetadata. \nWho will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\n2 PhD students (Laura Hellemans and Julie Hias) will be responsible for data storage and back-up\nof data during the project?\nWho will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ?\nThe principal investigator (Jos Tournoy) will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and\nreuse.\nWho bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nLaura Hellemans (PhD student) bears the end responsibility of updating & implementing this\nDMP.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n5 of 5"
