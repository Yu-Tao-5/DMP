The PreSTEAMM study assesses whether advanced glycation end products\n(AGEs) can be measured in the blood by ELISA after a single meal challenge with a meal high\nvs. low in AGEs in 5 healthy volunteers. The STEAMM study is a double-blind randomised\ncross-over trial in 20 healthy volunteers (2x2 weeks of intervention) wherein a fixed meal plan\nthat is high in AGEs will be compared to one that is low in AGEs. Measured end points include\nanthropometric measurements, regular blood work, OLINK proteomics, urine lactulose mannitol\ntesting, faecal calprotectin and the gut microbiota.\nThe second work package on the impact of emulsifiers on intestinal and general health contains\nan in vitro part and a clinical in vivo part. In vitro I will use a Caco2/HT29 MTX co-culture cell\nmodel and afterwards human-derived organoids of the colon from healthy volunteers and\ninflammatory bowel disease patients to test the effect of various emulsifiers on intestinal integrity\nand inflammation.\nThe clinical trial, the FOAM trial, is a placebo-controlled randomized trial in 60 healthy\nvolunteers during six weeks in which 5 emulsifiers are tested using baked goods on top of an\nemulsifier-free diet. Measured end points include anthropometric measurements, regular blood\nwork, OLINK proteomics, urine lactulose mannitol testing, faecal calprotectin and the gut\nmicrobiota.\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Describe these issues in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate.\nYes, human subject data\nFor the human trials (and use of the human-derived organoids from colonic biopsy material), approval from the ethical committee is\nmandatory.

If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nYes\nAfter finishing the project and before dissemination of the results, we will look carefully if any valorisable material is present. Additional\nIP discussions might start from that point on. Regarding planned collaborations, IP has been discussed already:\n- For the RAES lab (who will perform the the microbiota analysis), IP will be shared.\n- For the Olink cytokine panels: they will perform a service.\nAll of this has been discussed with LRD already and the necessary contracts have been drafted and signed by all parties as well. Of\ncourse, after finishing the project, LRD will be contacted again to rediscuss any potential for research valorisation at that stage.\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer\nagreements/ research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and\nwhat restrictions are in place.\nNo\nAre there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you\n(re)use? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.\nNo\n2. Documentation and Metadata\nClearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data\nunderstandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types\nrequired, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is\nrecorded).\nThe methodology and protocol will be described in detail in the physical lab book that will be stored at the lab at all times. An\naccompanying key file (.xls) to decipher which result files match which protocol (which will reference the pages in the lab book) will also\nbe available on a shared drive. Only members from the team will have access to these folders.\nCompletely analogue for clinical studies, the protocol, ethical documents, and results will also be stored in a shared drive. An\naccompanying file (.xls) will also state which folders contain which information (eg. Survey data from Redcap in a file named xxx, with\nthe extension .csv.)\nInformed consents (physical data) will be safely stored behind lock and key by the primary investigator (João Sabino), only he will have\naccess to these documents.\nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per\ndataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type)\nwhich metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nMetadata standards are typically not used within our lab group. We do have a minimal set of requirements that will be followed in order\nto ensure standardization and possibility to reinterpret and reuse the data when necessary and permitted.\nAll collected data will be labelled with (1) title, (2) author, (3) data type, (4) data created and date modified, (5) file size, (6) equipment\nreference (such as manufacturer and model identification). Depending on the nature of data additional metadata are collected.\nSequencing/genotyping:\nAll experimental data will be noted every day in the lab book including all detailed experimental data. Once the sequencing data will be\navailable, all files and folders will be labeled in a clearly structured way. The explanation of the labeling and the performed analysis will\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 10 January 2023\n10 of 13\nalso be written down in the lab book.\nFor sequencing, sequencing depth and analysis cut-offs will also be noted.\nMicroscopy:\nThe labeling of every individual picture taken will contain the patient culture number, the passage number, the experimental stimulation\nand the magnification.\nElectrical resistance (TEER)\nEvery measurement will be noted every day and contain all experimental information (patient culture number, passage number,\nexperimental stimulation). Analysis will be performed in excel files. The excel file will also contain all experimental data and refer to the\naccording pages in the labbook.\nBiobank\nAll patient information (age, gender, disease) will be registered in an anonymized way in the file containing all collected samples. Every\npatient will receive an identification nummer which can only be decoded by the responsible data manager.\nELISA: all information on the samples (plate layouts that indicate which samples will be used) and the used kits will be registered in the\nlab book and electronically in .xls (which will go into the shared drive). The protocol will be stored in the lab book as well. The data\nanalysis will be done in R for which the script (that also specifies every step) will be made available in the shared folder.\n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nAll experimental data will be written down in a physical lab book with the chronological reporting of all related experiments and results\nincluding a cross reference to electronic storage of data. (2) All data will be stored electronically on the personal KU Leuven One Drive\nfor daily back-up. Larger and RAW data files (RNA sequencing) will be stored on the KU Leuven K drive. Only members of the lab group\nthat have permission to access the files will have the ICT permission to do so. (e.g. students won’t be granted access to sensitive data).\nThe biological samples (blood, faeces, urine) will be stored in our biobank for potential later use or repeating of certain test. The\nnecessary storage room for the expected amount of biological material is already ascertained at the biobank.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nBackup is secured daily on central servers of the university. All data will be stored electronically on the personal KU Leuven One Drive,\nlarger and RAW data files (RNA sequencing) will be stored on the KU Leuven K drive. \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThe OneDrive has a limitation in storage capacity (2TB) which will be sufficient for this project. Larger data files can in addition be\nstored on the K-drive.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nSince we will be working with sensitive personal data that will only be fully anonymized at the end of the project, the data will be stored\nin the university's secure environment for private data. Checks and balances are currently in place to ensure that only authorized\npersonnel have access to sensitive data.\nFor example: sensitive physical documents will be kept by the PI behind lock and key (to which only he has access to), and students\nwon’t have access to the electronically sensitive files on the OneDrive. Regarding REDCap, the PI and myself will monitor access to the\nplatform.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nThe OneDrive (2TB) comes without charge, and should be enough for completion of this project. If needed TARGID will provide for an\nadditional budget for data management. Lastly, the benchfee could be used to pay for extra storage capacity.\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 10 January 2023\n11 of 13\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after\nthe end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual\nrestrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\nAll data generated and the biological material taken will be retained for minimally 10 years after ending the FWO project. This is\nbecause of the possibility of reuse of samples or data for new\nresearch projects conducted by TARGID. The informed consent includes a clause that permits later reuse of the obtained data. The cell\ncultures/organoids obtained will not be stored since this is biologically not possible. Data obtained through the experiments and coupes\nwill be stored.\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers – (OneDrive with automatic back-up procedures) for at least 10 years, conform\nthe KU Leuven RDM policy.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nThe OneDrive (2TB) comes without charge, and should be enough for completion of this project. If needed TARGID will provide for an\nadditional budget for data management. Lastly, the benchfee could be used to pay for extra storage capacity.\n5. Data sharing and reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  In the comment section please explain\nper dataset or data type which data will be made available.\nYes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …)\nOnly published data will be available in the form of publications or other dissemination of scientific work. All data will be anonymised\nwhen disseminated. More data can be made available or shared after permission of the responsible person (prof. João Sabino). Non-\npublished data will remain confidential until a final decision on publication of the data has been taken.\nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.\nData could be reused by other members of the TARGID team, after consultation and approval of the head of our lab group and/or the\nhead of TARGID (currently Séverine Vermeire and Kristin Verbeke respectively).\nData can possibly be accessed by a third party after signing a data sharing agreement and approval of the head of TARGID. An\nappropriate DTA and/or MTA will be in place. Costs for shipment are to be covered by the requesting party. Access will be considered\nafter a request is submitted explaining the planned reuse. Only uses for research purposes will be allowed and commercial reuse will be\nexcluded. Exceptions are to be submitted to the head of our lab group and/or TARGID (Séverine Vermeire and Kristin Verbeke).\nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd\nparty, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nYes, Intellectual Property Rights\nRegarding the microbiota results, the IP is shared with the RAES lab and dissemination of the results should be discussed with them\nfirst for this particular part of the project. However, this has already been discussed with LRD and we will keep in touch for this aspect of\nthe project. \nWhere will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 10 January 2023\n12 of 13\nA specific repository will be chosen after the publication strategy is known as some journal request specific repositories. \nWhen will the data be made available?\nOnly after publication of the research results in a peer-reviewed journal.\nWhich data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why.\nData usage licences will be discussed with LRD before any licences are granted. Similarly, when DTAs or MTAs are discussed, this will\nalways be after consulting and collaborating with LRD. \nDo you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in\nthe comment section.\nYes\nDepending on the data repository and the type of data that would be made available, a unique identifier will be added to the data set.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nIf shipment of data or material is required by an other study group abroad, after approval the costs of drafting of MTA/DTA and shipment\nitself will be covered by the requesting party.\n6. Responsibilities\nWho will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project?\nJudith Wellens and João Sabino \nWho will manage data storage and backup during the research project?\nJudith Wellens and João Sabino \nWho will manage data preservation and sharing?\nJoão Sabino \nWho will update and implement this DMP?\nThe PI (João Sabino) bears the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP. \nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Affiliation: KU Leuven (KUL) Funder: Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) Template: FWO DMP (Flemish Standard DMP) Principal Investigator: First Name Surname, n.n. n.n. Data Manager: Judith Wellens Project Administrator: Judith Wellens Grant number / URL: ZKE3104 - SB/1S06023N Wellens Judith ID: 192471 Start date: 01-11-2022 End date: 26-12-2024 Project abstract: In this project, the cooking methods and role of emulsifiers on intestinal and systemic inflammation, the gut barrier and gut microbiota will be investigated. The first work package on cooking methods will consist of the PreSTEAMM study and the STEAMM study. The PreSTEAMM study assesses whether advanced glycation end products (AGEs) can be measured in the blood by ELISA after a single meal challenge with a meal high vs. low in AGEs in 5 healthy volunteers. The STEAMM study is a double-blind randomised cross-over trial in 20 healthy volunteers (2x2 weeks of intervention) wherein a fixed meal plan that is high in AGEs will be compared to one that is low in AGEs. Measured end points include anthropometric measurements, regular blood work, OLINK proteomics, urine lactulose mannitol testing, faecal calprotectin and the gut microbiota. The second work package on the impact of emulsifiers on intestinal and general health contains an in vitro part and a clinical in vivo part. In vitro I will use a Caco2/HT29 MTX co-culture cell model and afterwards human-derived organoids of the colon from healthy volunteers and inflammatory bowel disease patients to test the effect of various emulsifiers on intestinal integrity and inflammation. The clinical trial, the FOAM trial, is a placebo-controlled randomized trial in 60 healthy volunteers during six weeks in which 5 emulsifiers are tested using baked goods on top of an emulsifier-free diet. Measured end points include anthropometric measurements, regular blood work, OLINK proteomics, urine lactulose mannitol testing, faecal calprotectin and the gut microbiota.

Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? Describe these issues in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. Yes, human subject data For the human trials (and use of the human-derived organoids from colonic biopsy material), approval from the ethical committee is mandatory. For all projects, this has already been granted: STEAMM: S65600 - approved 17/12/2021 PRET: G-2021-3896 PreSTEAMM: S66021 - approved 20/12/2021 PRET: G-2021-4168 FOAM: S66308 Pret: G-2022-4740 – approved 13/07/2022 VLECC/biopsy material for organoid research: S53684 Will you process personal data? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. Yes The personal data of 85 healthy volunteers will be collected. This includes 'regular' personal data such as age, weight, sex, and email addresses, but also 'special' or 'sensitive' personal data such as genetic information, ethnicity, health and biometric data.

Last modiﬁed 10 January 2023 9 of 13 Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes After finishing the project and before dissemination of the results, we will look carefully if any valorisable material is present. Additional IP discussions might start from that point on. Regarding planned collaborations, IP has been discussed already: - For the RAES lab (who will perform the the microbiota analysis), IP will be shared. - For the Olink cytokine panels: they will perform a service. All of this has been discussed with LRD already and the necessary contracts have been drafted and signed by all parties as well. Of course, after finishing the project, LRD will be contacted again to rediscuss any potential for research valorisation at that stage. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements/ research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. No Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. No 2. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). The methodology and protocol will be described in detail in the physical lab book that will be stored at the lab at all times. An accompanying key file (.xls) to decipher which result files match which protocol (which will reference the pages in the lab book) will also be available on a shared drive. Only members from the team will have access to these folders. Completely analogue for clinical studies, the protocol, ethical documents, and results will also be stored in a shared drive. An accompanying file (.xls) will also state which folders contain which information (eg. Survey data from Redcap in a file named xxx, with the extension .csv.) Informed consents (physical data) will be safely stored behind lock and key by the primary investigator (João Sabino), only he will have access to these documents. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. No Metadata standards are typically not used within our lab group. We do have a minimal set of requirements that will be followed in order to ensure standardization and possibility to reinterpret and reuse the data when necessary and permitted. All collected data will be labelled with (1) title, (2) author, (3) data type, (4) data created and date modified, (5) file size, (6) equipment reference (such as manufacturer and model identification). Depending on the nature of data additional metadata are collected. Sequencing/genotyping: All experimental data will be noted every day in the lab book including all detailed experimental data. Once the sequencing data will be available, all files and folders will be labeled in a clearly structured way. The explanation of the labeling and the performed analysis will Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 10 January 2023 10 of 13 also be written down in the lab book. For sequencing, sequencing depth and analysis cut-offs will also be noted. Microscopy: The labeling of every individual picture taken will contain the patient culture number, the passage number, the experimental stimulation and the magnification. Electrical resistance (TEER) Every measurement will be noted every day and contain all experimental information (patient culture number, passage number, experimental stimulation). Analysis will be performed in excel files. The excel file will also contain all experimental data and refer to the according pages in the labbook. Biobank All patient information (age, gender, disease) will be registered in an anonymized way in the file containing all collected samples. Every patient will receive an identification nummer which can only be decoded by the responsible data manager. ELISA: all information on the samples (plate layouts that indicate which samples will be used) and the used kits will be registered in the lab book and electronically in .xls (which will go into the shared drive). The protocol will be stored in the lab book as well. The data analysis will be done in R for which the script (that also specifies every step) will be made available in the shared folder. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? All experimental data will be written down in a physical lab book with the chronological reporting of all related experiments and results including a cross reference to electronic storage of data. (2) All data will be stored electronically on the personal KU Leuven One Drive for daily back-up. Larger and RAW data files (RNA sequencing) will be stored on the KU Leuven K drive. Only members of the lab group that have permission to access the files will have the ICT permission to do so. (e.g. students won’t be granted access to sensitive data). The biological samples (blood, faeces, urine) will be stored in our biobank for potential later use or repeating of certain test. The necessary storage room for the expected amount of biological material is already ascertained at the biobank. How will the data be backed up? Backup is secured daily on central servers of the university. All data will be stored electronically on the personal KU Leuven One Drive, larger and RAW data files (RNA sequencing) will be stored on the KU Leuven K drive. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes The OneDrive has a limitation in storage capacity (2TB) which will be sufficient for this project. Larger data files can in addition be stored on the K-drive. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Since we will be working with sensitive personal data that will only be fully anonymized at the end of the project, the data will be stored in the university's secure environment for private data. Checks and balances are currently in place to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data. For example: sensitive physical documents will be kept by the PI behind lock and key (to which only he has access to), and students won’t have access to the electronically sensitive files on the OneDrive. Regarding REDCap, the PI and myself will monitor access to the platform. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The OneDrive (2TB) comes without charge, and should be enough for completion of this project. If needed TARGID will provide for an additional budget for data management. Lastly, the benchfee could be used to pay for extra storage capacity. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 10 January 2023 11 of 13 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). All data generated and the biological material taken will be retained for minimally 10 years after ending the FWO project. This is because of the possibility of reuse of samples or data for new research projects conducted by TARGID. The informed consent includes a clause that permits later reuse of the obtained data. The cell cultures/organoids obtained will not be stored since this is biologically not possible. Data obtained through the experiments and coupes will be stored. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? The data will be stored on the university's central servers – (OneDrive with automatic back-up procedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The OneDrive (2TB) comes without charge, and should be enough for completion of this project. If needed TARGID will provide for an additional budget for data management. Lastly, the benchfee could be used to pay for extra storage capacity. 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) Only published data will be available in the form of publications or other dissemination of scientific work. All data will be anonymised when disseminated. More data can be made available or shared after permission of the responsible person (prof. João Sabino). Non- published data will remain confidential until a final decision on publication of the data has been taken. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Data could be reused by other members of the TARGID team, after consultation and approval of the head of our lab group and/or the head of TARGID (currently Séverine Vermeire and Kristin Verbeke respectively). Data can possibly be accessed by a third party after signing a data sharing agreement and approval of the head of TARGID. An appropriate DTA and/or MTA will be in place. Costs for shipment are to be covered by the requesting party. Access will be considered after a request is submitted explaining the planned reuse. Only uses for research purposes will be allowed and commercial reuse will be excluded. Exceptions are to be submitted to the head of our lab group and/or TARGID (Séverine Vermeire and Kristin Verbeke). Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. Yes, Intellectual Property Rights Regarding the microbiota results, the IP is shared with the RAES lab and dissemination of the results should be discussed with them first for this particular part of the project. However, this has already been discussed with LRD and we will keep in touch for this aspect of the project. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 10 January 2023 12 of 13 A specific repository will be chosen after the publication strategy is known as some journal request specific repositories. When will the data be made available? Only after publication of the research results in a peer-reviewed journal. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. Data usage licences will be discussed with LRD before any licences are granted. Similarly, when DTAs or MTAs are discussed, this will always be after consulting and collaborating with LRD. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. Yes Depending on the data repository and the type of data that would be made available, a unique identifier will be added to the data set. What are the expected costs for data sharing?
