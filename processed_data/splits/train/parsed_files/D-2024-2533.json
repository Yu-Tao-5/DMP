In my previous research, using a composite plant assay, I analyzed the plant root response upon T-DNA transformation and\nidentified several signaling peptides having a role in hairy root development. I also confirmed that most of the T-DNA encoded proteins contributed, to\nsome extent, to the development of hairy roots. However, there is still a substantial knowledge gap on the molecular function of T-DNA encoded\nproteins. Building on the findings of my PhD and using novel and complementary approaches, this project aims at gaining a better understanding of the\nplant molecular pathways affected by the different T-DNA encoded proteins. To identify where and when in Arabidopsis thaliana roots the different T-\nDNA encoded proteins impact HRD we will first assess the spatiotemporal expression profile of the T-DNA genes. Next, using a cell-specific\ncomparative transcriptomics upon inoculation of Arabidopsis roots with rhizogenic Agrobacterium T-DNA mutants, we will map how the different T-\nDNA encoded proteins trigger HRD. Finally, we will investigate the biological relevance of signaling peptides during HRD and analyze which T-DNA\nencoded proteins modulate their expression. In conclusion, we propose a powerful integrated approach combining various technologies and functional\nvalidation to map key processes in HRD.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n24-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
