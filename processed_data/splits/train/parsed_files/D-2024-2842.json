This project focusses on the development of cost-effective thin-film composite (TFC) membranes for AWE systems. Anion exchange\nmembranes that possess both alkaline stability and high ion conductivity are a bottleneck in current AWE technology. TFC membranes are novel in\nAWE and allow to combine both requirements into one low-cost membrane. These membranes will be developed in two steps. The first step involves\nthe development of support membranes with high performance stability. Crosslinking of PVDF and PVC support membranes has been identified as\npromising strategy to enhance their stability in alkaline conditions. The second step comprises the design of a thin selective layer with high ionic\nconductivity on top of the support. Polyepoxyether and crosslinked PVBC are ideally suited for this purpose, due to their intrinsic chemical stability.\nThe implementation of quaternary ammonium groups provides the top layer with positive charges that facilitate hydroxide ion transfer. The successful\ncompletion of this project will result in alkaline electrolyzers with improved current density, which is essential to drag down the cost of green\nhydrogen.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n12-02-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The lab notes and work laptop are stored in a locked cupboard in the researcher's office. The office is located in a badge-restricted area of the building, and is locked if no one is inside. The laptop is secured with a password and access to double authentication is required to access the KUL One Drive system from other devices.
