Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Large Volume Storage: The in-house EEG data used in this project is stored in the research unit's secured (encrypted) and password-protected storage facilities of ESAT-STADIUS.The publicly available datasets are stored on research data platforms such as Zenodo.org, rdr.kuleuven.be (see before). During development, software is stored on an encrypted personal drive, and version control software (e.g., Github) is used as a backup. After publication, the software is made available on GitHub. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Internal EEG data is backed up daily on the database server of the research division ESAT-STADIUS. The backup process is managed by the IT division of the department. Software is backed up daily using version control systems. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.

Yes How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The data stored in the ESAT servers has access regulated by an access control list (ACL) that grants read-write access to the project owner, and read-only access to specific users. The ACL is managed by the project owner and the STADIUS data manager. Client computers can access the data using SMB2 (or higher) from specific IP ranges, NFSv4 from specific (IT-managed) systems.
