Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nWork Package 1: Identification of novel TRPV2 modulators\nA large number of venom and plant extractions will be investigated using a fluorescence-based\nTHC-induced assay. In this assay, HEK293 cells stably expressing mouse TRPV2 are transferred\ninto wells of a microtiter plate and loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye fura-2.\nMoreover, whole-cell patch-clamp measurements on HEK cells overexpressing mouse and human\nTRPV2 will be performed to investigate potential TRPV2 species differences. We will evaluate the\neffect of selected compounds on the responses of primary stromal cells of different species.\nPrimary endometrial stromal cultures will be isolated from human, and mice (TRPV2\n+/+\n and\nTRPV2\n-/-\n), and responses will be tested using Fura-2 mediated Ca\n2+\n-imaging and validated by\nwhole-cell patch-clamp experiments.\n \n \nWP2: Structure-function activity relationship investigation (QSARs): Biophysical\ncharacterisation TRPV2\nChimaeras between mouse and human TRPV2 will be constructed and their functionality\nassessed by patch-clamp experiments in a heterologous overexpressing system.\n \nWP3: Assessment of TRPV2 as a target for the treatment of endometrial cancer\nTask 3.1 TRPV2 agonist therapy\nThe optimized and in-depth characterized lead compounds will be used to investigate the\ninvolvement of TRPV2 \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo\n proliferation, migration and differentiation assays of\ncontrol and maligned endometrial cells. To this end, we will test both TRPV2 agonists (THC and\noutcome WP1) and antagonists (LICR1 and outcome WP1) in proliferation, migration and\ndifferentiation protocols. To validate the anti-tumour properties of TRPV2 targeting compounds,\nwe will use endometrial tumour cell lines with a variable EMT status and patient-derived\nendometrial cancer organoids (EC-O).\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 5\nWork\npackage\nOrigin of data\n Type of data\nFile\nformat \nEstimated\n Volume\nWP 1\n:\nTask 1.1:\nExploration of\nnatural\nsources for\nnovel TRPV2\nligands\n \nComputer, HPLC\nchromatogram\nNumerical and\nimage, ...\nxlsx,\njpeg\n1 GB \nTask 1.2:\nValidation of\nhit\ncompounds &\nTask 1.3:\nSelectivity\nprofile\ndetermination\nof hit\ncompounds\n \nComputer\nelectrophysiological,\nexperimental data\nelectrophysiological,\nexperimental data,\nnumerical\nAnalyzed\ndata\n(Xlsx)\nRaw\ndata\n(Xlsx)\n500 MB\nWP 2\n: Task\n2.1:\nMolecular\nelucidation of\nthe difference\nin compound\nsensitivity\nbetween\nhuman TRPV2\nand rat\nTRPV2 & Task\n2.2:\nIdentifying\nthe lead\ncompoundÂ´s\nmechanism of\naction\n \n \nComputer\nelectrophysiological,\nexperimental data,\nnumerical\nAnalyzed\ndata\n(Xlsx)\nRaw\ndata\n(Xlsx)\n500 MB\n \nComputer\nCalcium imaging of\nprimary stromal\ncells\nRaw\ndata\n(nd2)\n \nExported\ndata\n(xlsx)\n \nAnalysed\ndata\n(xlsx)\n \nImages\n& figures\n(tiff,\njpeg)\n10 GB/file\n \n \n \n10 MB/file\n \n \n \n10 MB/file\n \n \n \n1 MB/file\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 5\nWP3\n:\nAssessment\nof TRPV2 as a\ntarget for the\ntreatment of\nendometrial\ncancer\nendometrial\ntumour cell\nlines\ncomputer\nCalcium imaging of\nprimary stromal\ncells\nRaw\ndata\n(nd2)\n \nExported\ndata\n(xlsx)\n \nAnalysed\ndata\n(xlsx)\n \nImages\n& figures\n(tiff,\njpeg)\n10 GB/file\n \n \n \n10 MB/file\n \n \n \n10 MB/file\n \n \n \n1 MB/file\nWP3\n:\nendometrial\ncancer-\nderived\norganoids\nComputer,\nautomated analysis\nof cell behavior\nMigration and\ninvasion assays in\ncell imaging\nplatform incucyte\nRaw\ndata\n(nd2,\nNikon)\n \nExported\ndata\n(xlsx)\n \nAnalysed\ndata\n(xlsx)\n \nImages\n& figures\n(tiff,\njpeg)\n10 GB/file\n \n \n \n10 MB/file\n \n \n \n10 MB/file\n \n \n \n1 MB/file\n3.
