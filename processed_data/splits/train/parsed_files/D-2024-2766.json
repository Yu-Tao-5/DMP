The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that currently\nmore than 700,000 patients die each year due to infections with multidrug-resistant pathogens. This number is predicted to rise dramatically, with 10\nmillion deaths annually by 2050, if no actions are taken. In order to avoid the looming prospect of a post-antibiotic age within the next few decades, a\ncontinuous development of not just new antibiotics, but more importantly, new classes of antibiotics, is imperative. An attractive yet underexplored\ntarget for antibiotic drug development in bacteria is the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway (FasII). Fatty acids are essential components of cellular\nmembranes. Most bacteria are unable to scavenge fatty acids from host organisms and therefore rely on de novo production. The FasII enzyme\nresponsible for the final step in the fatty acid elongation cycle, differs significantly from the FasI pathway of mammals, plants and fungi. These\nenzymes, known as enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductases (ENR), have thus been recognized as an interesting target for new antibacterials with a novel\nmode of action. Triclosan, one of the most common additives to consumer products worldwide, is a well-known inhibitor of the ENR enzyme FabI in a\nwide range of bacteria. While triclosan was found to be unsuitable as an antibiotic due to its toxicity, multiple FabI inhibitors with improved\nbioavailability and toxicity profiles have been reported in recent years as a potential new class of antibiotics. However, several notorious and highly\npathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, including the opportunistic WHO priority I pathogen P. aeruginosa, have been shown to be resistant to FabI\ninhibitors. This resistance stems from the expression of FabV, an ENR isoenzyme. The goal of this project is the development of novel FabV\ninhibitors, in order to re-sensitize these pathogens to antibiotics.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n04-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Yes, dual use In the project, a research stay at the research lab of Prof. Eshwar Mahenthiralingam in planned during the second half of 2026, providing the research has progressed enough to enable this. During this stay, the goal would be to characterize the capability of our newly developed antimicrobials to prevent the growth of Burkholderia species, including B. mallei and B. pseudomallei. These two species are classified by The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as category B bioterrorism agents, given the previous use of B. mallei (the causative agent of the equid disease glanders) as a biological weapon during World War I. Bacterial strains will only be used to assess the capacity of our FabV inhibitors to incapacitate the above mentioned pathogens. No research regarding the pathogens themselves will be conducted and thus no data will be gathered beyond the microbial activity of our congeners. The research will be conducted in an academic research lab, following the appropriate security and person safety measures.
