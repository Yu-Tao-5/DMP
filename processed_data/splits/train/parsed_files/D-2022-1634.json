All external hard drives are prote cted by password and antivirus software. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The computer cluster “Dirac” can be used for free. Possible costs include the purchase of new external hard drives. This could be covered by the C 1 grant if necessary. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 8 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). All data generated throughout the research project will be retained for 10 years in accordance with KU Leuven policies. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? All data will be stored on the computer cluster “Dirac” with daily automatic backups to the central ICT servers. Additionally, the data will be archived in the RDR repository of KU Leuven. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The computer cluster “Dirac” and the RDR repository can be used for free. If there are any unforeseen costs, these can be covered by the funds of the PI and the division Quantum Chemistry and Physical Chemistry (QCPC) . 6. Data Sharing and Reuse FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9 Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE , CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY . AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS . FOR MORE INFORMATION : HTTPS ://WIKI.SURFNET .NL/DISPLAY /STANDARDS /INFO-EU- REPO /#INFOEUREPO -ACCESS RIGHTS ☒ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☐ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: All data generated throughout the project will be made available in the open -access RDR repository. If access is r estricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Contact information of the PI will be provided in the datasets for those who are further interested. The PI will be responsible for following up requests for data acce ss and reuse. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify : Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. All data will be archived in the open -access RDR repository. When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS ’. Upon publication of the results. Unpublished results will be made available upon request by email. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10 Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AN D UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS . IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED , THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED . DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THA T. EXAMPLE ANSWER : E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS .” 8 The data will be open to all external users under the licens e generated by the RDR platform, e.g. CC -BY 4.0 Therefore, it will be available to anyone for any purpose, provided that they give appropriate credit to the creators. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already availabl e, please provide it here . INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes: What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? No costs are expected. The RDR repository is free, provided that the data does not exceed 50 GB per year, which is not expected to happen. 7. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project? The PI, Thomas Jagau, is responsible for collecting, processing, analy zing and documenting the generated data and metadata. 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11 Who will manage data storage and backup during the resear ch project? The PI, Thomas Jagau, is responsible for regular data storage and backups. Who will manage data preservation and sharing? The PI , Thomas Jagau, is responsible for data preservation and sharing. Who will update and implement this DMP? The PI , Thomas Jagau, is responsible for implementing this DMP and updating it when needed."
