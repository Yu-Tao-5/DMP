The disease is clinically defined by the occurrence of typical motor symptoms and is\ncommonly associated with the aggregation of the protein alpha-synuclein. While idiopathic cases are often associated with numerous risk factors,\nfamilial cases are caused by mutations in >22 different genes. Many of these genes point to a variety of underlying molecular causes and our recent\nresearch has identified a cluster of genes that code for proteins involved in protein homeostasis, including LRRK2, SYNJ1, EndoA1, Rab39, and\nDNAJC6. It is however not clear how these proteins act in a network, how pathogenic mutations affect proteostasis and how to counteract the resulting\ndysfunction. This project will combine our expertise in protein biochemistry and structure determination with in vivo genetics and structure-function\ncell biology to mechanistically define how these proteins converge in a functional network, and to develop strategies to reverse pathogenic effects. We\nwill create a unique new collection of nanobodies to facilitate this research and use new screenable fly models to reveal how mutations in these\nParkinsonism proteostasis genes cause neuronal cellular dysfunction and proteostasis defects.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n01-07-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

The disease is clinically defined by the occurrence of typical motor symptoms and is commonly associated with the aggregation of the protein alpha-synuclein. While idiopathic cases are often associated with numerous risk factors, familial cases are caused by mutations in >22 different genes. Many of these genes point to a variety of underlying molecular causes and our recent research has identified a cluster of genes that code for proteins involved in protein homeostasis, including LRRK2, SYNJ1, EndoA1, Rab39, and DNAJC6. It is however not clear how these proteins act in a network, how pathogenic mutations affect proteostasis and how to counteract the resulting dysfunction. This project will combine our expertise in protein biochemistry and structure determination with in vivo genetics and structure-function cell biology to mechanistically define how these proteins converge in a functional network, and to develop strategies to reverse pathogenic effects. We will create a unique new collection of nanobodies to facilitate this research and use new screenable fly models to reveal how mutations in these Parkinsonism proteostasis genes cause neuronal cellular dysfunction and proteostasis defects.

The organisation of research data follows a hierarchical folder structure folder structure based on model organism (eg. flies/cells/...). At the second level, these folders contain subfolders per experiment type (eg. histology, ERG, CLEM, immunofluorescence,...). At the third level, these folders contain subfolders per individual experiment (with date indication, see below). Each of these experiment folders contain subfolders for raw data, processed data, and analysed data. Digital files and folders of individual experiments will be named following a standard naming convention naming convention . All file names in a given dataset will follow the same format: they will start with the date, followed by the project acronym, a concise descriptive name, and an optional version number. Whenever possible, names will be kept under 32 characters, containing only letters, numbers, and underscores. Dots will only be used for version control indicators (minor revisions indicated by decimal numbers, and major revisions by whole numbers): YYYYMMDD_Project_Experiment_ version.format. Similarly, folder naming for individual experiments follows the following structure: YYYYMMDD(_Project)_Experiment Data will be accompanied by documentation documentation containing all contextual and descriptive features of the research data, which allow to understand and (re)use the data. Detailed procedures of each experiment are logged in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook), with reference of each experiment to the directory path of the folder containing raw and analysed data files. This also includes data collection methods, protocols, and code explanation. Documentation is stored at the study- and the data-level, providing data provenance from the original source data to specific datasets linked to publications.

Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Digital data Digital data - KU Leuven - KU Leuven All scientists use an ELN ELN to log details of their experiments (history of experiments, protocols and analysed data). Files containing raw and analysed data are stored on KU Leuven servers. Primary storage for active digital files active digital files will be on KU Leuven servers. KU Leuven offers fast (\"J-drive) and slower (\"L-drive\") storage that allows reading/writing/modification of non-confidential, confidential, and strictly confidential data. KU Leuven further offers the ManGO platform for storage and management of large volumes of active research data large volumes of active research data . This platform allows secure storage, manual and automated metadata coupling, data workflows, and file sharing. Data that is no longer active, can be archived archived on the KU Leuven K-drive, which allows reading of non-confidential, confidential, and strictly confidential data - VUB - VUB All scientists use an ELN ELN . All raw data of biochemical and biophysical measurements, history of experiments, protocols and analysed data are uploaded to this E-Notebook (for very large files > 10Mb a cross-reference is made to the relevant Sharepoint and hard disk folder). These are backed up in the cloud. All data are additional be stored on VUB Sharepoint VUB Sharepoint . Due to the large amount of data, all raw data of successful structural biology experiments (EM, X-ray) are saved on dedicated hard disks dedicated hard disks . Two copies are made on separate hard disks that are kept on physically different locations. Hard disks are numbered and a list (excel file of data stored on each disk is kept at a central point on the Sharepoint folder). Moreover, a cross-reference is made between the metadata in the ELN and the location of the raw data on the hard disks. Additionally, all raw structural biology data are stored at the synchrotron or at the VIB-VUB facility for Bio Electron Cryogenic Microscopy (BECM). Physical samples Physical samples Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory. Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacterial glycerol stock (-80°C).
