However, current \navailable mammary organoid  culture protocols result in morphologically simple structures that do not \nresemble the branched  morphology of the in vivo mammary gland. To study dynamic mammary gland \nremodeling at the  molecular level, I developed a protocol to obtain complex branched mammary \norganoids that enable e x vivo optical monitoring of branching and remodeling events. To unravel the \nmolecular signaling pathways driving mammary gland remodeling, I will combine this novel organoid \nmodel with multiplexed signaling reporters and timelapse microscopy. I will chall enge the system by \nintroducing sporadic loss of BRCA1, an oncogenic driver in the mammary gland, to elucidate the molecular \ndynamics that drive mammary tumor initiation. Using the dynamic readouts from the multiplexed \nsignaling biosensors in the complex ma mmary organoids I will build a 4D map of dynamic signaling during \nmammary gland remodeling and tumor initiation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   4 \n 2.

However, current available mammary organoid culture protocols result in morphologically simple structures that do not resemble the branched morphology of the in vivo mammary gland. To study dynamic mammary gland remodeling at the molecular level, I developed a protocol to obtain complex branched mammary organoids that enable e x vivo optical monitoring of branching and remodeling events. To unravel the molecular signaling pathways driving mammary gland remodeling, I will combine this novel organoid model with multiplexed signaling reporters and timelapse microscopy. I will chall enge the system by introducing sporadic loss of BRCA1, an oncogenic driver in the mammary gland, to elucidate the molecular dynamics that drive mammary tumor initiation. Using the dynamic readouts from the multiplexed signaling biosensors in the complex ma mmary organoids I will build a 4D map of dynamic signaling during mammary gland remodeling and tumor initiation.
