Extended- or controlled release drug formulations employ different strategies to modulate dissolution and thus absorption and therefore ensure\nan appropriate therapeutic effect. One such formulation strategy is the use of a rate controlling membrane that modifies the drug release from the\ndosage form. However, excipients used in the formulation of such coatings (such as ethylcellulose and polymethacrylate derivatives) for the past years\nhave a poorly controlled exact structure and composition. Because of this, it is very hard to elucidate and optimise the influence of the coating polymer\nand manufacturing conditions on the coating’s microstructure. Polyoxazolines, on the other hand, offer synthetic versatility and a large, systematic and\nprecisely controllable structural variability. The aims of this study are to systematically investigate the impact of various polyoxazolines and the\ncoating's manufacturing conditions on the coating membrane’s microstructure. Along with this, dissolution properties, stability, and the influence of\ninitial polymer solution state (a solution or an aqueous dispersion, a pseudolatex) will also be assessed. If the project is successful, it will lead to a more\nthorough, rational-design based approach of developing better extended and controlled release formulations.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n02-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). 1 . Labbooks are kept where reasoning, methods and results are saved for every experiment. This data will be curated according to good laboratory practices, in other words: chronologically, pages numbered, table of contents at the start, clear and readable writing, all data remains legible, even when crossing something out due to a mistake. 2 . Many instruments also generate metadata that are stored in the files generated as output. This information is stored on top of point 1. 3 . When either point 1 or point 2 would give insufficient information regarding any file, a text file is included in the results folder with additional information. 4 . All files are appropriately named, allowing for easy identification of any files. All the files will be ordered in clear and well-named folder structures that can be understood and interpreted by any reader.

Yes Two standards are applicable for this project: one for the lab books, one for digital data. For the lab books: every entry comes with a title and date, followed by a what? and why? section to explain why the experiment was performed. This is then followed by a how? section including a detailed explanation of the methods. Finally, results are discussed briefly as well. Where possible, templates are used that the researcher can simply filled in - especially if a certain technique is applied often. For data stored digitally: the results are grouped per technique. Inside these folders, subfolders can be used to distinguish bulk materials and materials in film form. Inside these folders, data is grouped in folders that contain the data the analysis was ran as well as the (shortened) title of the experiment. The files themselves also contain the date in their names, the shortened experiment title, and a number in case duplicates or triplicates were ran. Dates specified for digital information always match with the ones from the lab book, ensuring good consistency between the two. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? All the collected data will be preserved on a central J-drive.
