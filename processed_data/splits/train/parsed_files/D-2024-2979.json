The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Aya Takeoka, 0000-0003-0322-677X\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles\nProject number 1 & title  G074823N Spinal circuit mechanisms of motor adaptation using a complex locomotor sequence task.\nFunder(s) GrantID 2 G074823N\nAffiliation(s) ☐ KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

Therapeutic  \napproaches aim for functional recovery by facilitating axonal growth, removing growth barriers, or replacing  \nlost cells. However, all approaches face a common challenge: the spinal cord below the injury must adapt to  \nfunction with limited brain input. Rehabilitative training facilitates locomotor recovery by “teaching” the  \nspinal cord to generate movements under such conditions. Nevertheless, we know little about the identities of  \nspinal neurons and mechanisms contributing to locomotor recovery. \nMy lab has identified a mechanism in which repetitive training promotes excitability of the spinal cord over  \nweeks to months via defined classes of neurons. Our data suggest the exciting possibility that training-induced  \nimprovements are driven by specific cell types. However, how spinal neurons are modulated in a short  \ntimescale remains unclear, i.e., within a training session, which leads to beneficial outcomes of long-term  \ntraining. Here, we leverage a unique approach of recording neuronal activities in awake, behaving mice to  \nunderstand how defined neurons facilitate locomotor improvements during a single training session. We will  \nlink this short-term adaptation to long-term change by screening the diversity of neurons activated at different  \nrehabilitative training stages. This work will contribute to future developments in facilitating recovery after  \nspinal cord injury.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

The FWO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.

FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 3Please provide a short project description Severe spinal injuries disrupt communication between the brain and circuits below the lesion. Therapeutic approaches aim for functional recovery by facilitating axonal growth, removing growth barriers, or replacing lost cells. However, all approaches face a common challenge: the spinal cord below the injury must adapt to function with limited brain input. Rehabilitative training facilitates locomotor recovery by “teaching” the spinal cord to generate movements under such conditions. Nevertheless, we know little about the identities of spinal neurons and mechanisms contributing to locomotor recovery. My lab has identified a mechanism in which repetitive training promotes excitability of the spinal cord over weeks to months via defined classes of neurons. Our data suggest the exciting possibility that training-induced improvements are driven by specific cell types. However, how spinal neurons are modulated in a short timescale remains unclear, i.e., within a training session, which leads to beneficial outcomes of long-term training. Here, we leverage a unique approach of recording neuronal activities in awake, behaving mice to understand how defined neurons facilitate locomotor improvements during a single training session. We will link this short-term adaptation to long-term change by screening the diversity of neurons activated at different rehabilitative training stages. This work will contribute to future developments in facilitating recovery after spinal cord injury.

RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook) and/or in hard copy lab notebooks that refer to specific datasets. All datasets will be accompanied by a README.txt file containing all the associated metadata (see more details below). The data will be generated following standardized protocols. Clear and detailed descriptions of these protocols will be stored in our lab protocol database, and published along with the results. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 17Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: While specific data types might require particular metadata, as a general rule the metadata will be based on a generalized metadata schema such as Dublin Core or DataCite. We will closely monitor MIBBI (Minimum Informa􀆟on for Biological and Biomedical Investigations) for metadata standards that are more specific to our data. Metadata will include the following elements: • Title: free text • Creator: Last name, first name, organization • Date and time reference • Subject: Choice of keywords and classifications • Description: Text explaining the content of the data set and other contextual information needed for the correct interpretation of the data, the software(s) (including version number) used to produce and to read the data, the purpose of the experiment, etc. • Format: Details of the file format, • Resource Type: data set, image, audio, etc. • Identifier: DOI (when applicable) • Access rights: closed access, embargoed access, restricted access, open access. For specific datasets, additional metadata will be associated with the data file as appropriate. Give details as needed for the project. The final dataset will be accompanied by this information under the form of a README.txt document. This file will be located in the top level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used. This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse. 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 18Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data.☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☒ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☒ Other: Digital files will be stored on NERF servers. - Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory. - Omics data: omics data generated during the project will either be stored on KU Leuven servers or on The Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC), initially in the staging area and later in the archive area. - Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock (-80°C). All published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request. - Genetically modified organisms: Mice will be maintained in facilities of the Laboratory Animal Center of KU Leuven, which applies Standard Operation Procedures concerning housing, feeding, health monitoring to assure consistent care in accordance with European and national regulations and guidelines. All animals will be registered in the Leuven Animal Information System (LAIS) database, along with corresponding genotyping information, ethical approval documents and animal provider receipts. Drosophila lines will be stored in a dedicated room and managed using a specific database for storage of the corresponding information (including genotype, origin, number of vials and date of transfer, crossing schemes) and vial tracking via unique QR codes. Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate. - Algorithms, scripts and softwares: All the relevant algorithms, scripts and so 􀆟ware code driving the project will be stored in a private online git repository from the GitHub account of the department (https://github.com/nerf). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 19How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? ☐ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☐ Personal back-ups I make (specify) ☒ Other (specify) NERF drives are backed-up according to the following scheme: - data stored on the “NERFfs01” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept. Incremental backups are done daily from one 20 TB QNAP NAS to a second 20 TB QNAP NAS. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes There is sufficient storage and back-up capacity on the NERF server: The server is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster with NetApp eseries storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front-end. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data NERF server is accessible only by laboratory members, and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 20What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?estimation is based on the following costs: -The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 173,78 €/TB/Year. -Maintaining a mouse colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), excluding the costs of genotyping. When no experiment is planned with a particular mouse strain, and in compliance with the 3R’s rule (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk), cryopreservation will thus be used to safeguard the strain, prevent genetic drift, loss of transgene and potential infections or breeding problems. Cryopreservation of sperm/embryos costs about 900 to 1300 euro per genotype, plus a minimal annual storage fee (25 euro per strain for 250 to 500 embryos). Frozen specimen are kept in two separate liquid nitrogen tanks at two different sites on campus. When necessary, the costs of revitalization from cryopreserved sperm/embryos are about 1,100/600 euro. Electricity costs for the -80° freezers present in the labs are included in the central budget for NERF. Data storage and backup costs are covered by the central budget for NERF and by individual lab. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☐ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☒ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) The minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets. Beyond the 5 years, some data cannot be preserved for storage and budget reasons due to high cost. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 21Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of publication. For all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows: -Digital datasets: files will be stored on the NERF server. -Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory. -Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock (-80°C). -Genetically modified organisms: Actively used mouse lines will be housed locally. All other lines that are not actively used for experiments will be cryopreserved. -Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?The total estimated cost of data storage during 5 years after the end of the project is 420,000 euro (ca.105,000 euro per year), and will be covered by FWO grant and other budgets. This estimation is based on the following costs: -The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 173,78€/TB/Year for the NERF server. -Maintaining a mouse colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), excluding the costs of genotyping. When no experiment is planned with a particular mouse strain, and in compliance with the 3R’s rule (h ps://www.nc3rs.org.uk), cryopreservation will thus be used to safeguard the strain, prevent gene􀆟c dri 􀆟, loss of transgene and potential infections or breeding problems. Cryopreservation of sperm/embryos costs about 900 to 1300 euro per genotype, plus a minimal annual storage fee (25 euro per strain for 250 to 500 embryos).
