The project consists of 3 work packages (WPs) involving both in-vitro\nexperiments as well as clinical trials in healthy volunteers aiming to investigate the effect of\nintermittent exogenous ketosis on de novo angiogenesis and epigenetic regulation in skeletal\nmuscle during exercise and training. In WP1, we characterize the epigenetic mechanisms by\nwhich ketone bodies may impact the adaptive response to exercise in muscle cells. In WP2, we\nassess the effect of intermittent exogenous ketosis on muscle and endothelial cells during\nmuscular degeneration and rehabilitation in healthy volunteers. In WP3, we determine the effect\nof intermittent exogenous ketosis on the muscular adaptive response to endurance training in\nhealthy volunteers. These data are acquired to investigate the intended research questions and\nto allow publication in high-impact journals.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
