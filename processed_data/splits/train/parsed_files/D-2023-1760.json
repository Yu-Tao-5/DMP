The PI will create an investigator file in accordance with the EC/GCP requirements. All basic research data that will be generated within this project, will be written down in a lab book according to a mutual method we are using in the lab. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.Storage during research: Documentation and processed data will be deposited in REDCap. Storage capacity can be extended accordingly. Daily backups of the database are foreseen. All historical data are stored in the system. Manuscripts will be published and archived in public repositories. Other electronic files (text, images, spreadsheets,...) will be stored on KU Leuven servers, with hourly onsite backup and mirroring. Storage after research: data will be available in REDCap for at least 5 years. Idem for manuscripts, other electronic files and basic research images/samples. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: If no, please specify: 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7Digital data will only be available through the secure servers of KU Leuven / UZ Leuven. Data will not be released to the public. Any email traffic will only be through the university's secured servers. Written data (logbook, data manual, ...) will only remain within the walls of the university and will always be kept behind a closed door. Samples will be stored in the KU Leuven biobank according to the rules set by the university. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?No additional charges provided. Data will be stored on UZ Leuven / KU Leuven data servers that offer sufficient capacity to their employees at no additional cost. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).Datasets collected in the context of clinical research (WP 1, 3 and 4), which fall under the scope of the Belgian Law of 7 May 2004, will be archived for 25 years, in agreement with UZ Leuven policy and the European Regulation 536/2014 on clinical trials of medicinal products for human use. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Documentation and processed data will be deposited in REDCap and on the KU Leuven servers. Storage capacity can be extended accordingly. All historical data are stored in the system. Storage after research: data will be available in REDCap for at least 5 years. Idem for manuscripts, other electronic files and basic research images/samples. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?No additional costs foreseen; FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 116. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☐ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☐ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☒ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Data will only be made available afterwards upont the request of editors/reviewers. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.To be discussed FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.Upon publications of research results Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 At this point, no data from the project will be shared or be reused. This might change throughout the ongoing project. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes: What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Not applicable 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 137.
