Cumulative evidence indicates that preschool teachers do not systematically\nstimulate preschoolersâ€™ acquisition of early number and patterning competencies, due to\nlimitations both in the availability of effective research-based materials and in teachersâ€™\npedagogical content knowledge (PCK) in these domains. Following a design-based research\nmethodology, this C3 project will address these limitations by designing and implementing (a)\neffective research-based instructional materials to enhance preschoolersâ€™ early number and\npatterning competencies, and (b) a research-based PCK guide for (future) preschool teachers\nfocusing on the developmental trajectories and effective instructional strategies in these\ndomains, complemented with a continuous professional development program. The effectiveness\nof the research-based instructional materials to enhance preschoolersâ€™ early number and\npatterning competencies will be evaluated via two intervention studies in Flemish classrooms\nwith 4-5-year-old children.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. General Information\nName of the project lead (PI)\nJoke Torbeyns\nC1-C2 Project number & title\nC3 3H210379\nTowards powerful early math instruction: Designing materials to improve (future) preschool\nteachers’ and preschoolers’ number and patterning competencies.\n2. Data description\n2.1. Will you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\n2.2. What data will you collect, generate or reuse? Describe the origin, type and\nformat of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a\nnumbered list or table and per objective of the project.\nThe two intervention studies with preschoolers involve the same WP’s and same type of data to\nbe collected. Only the intervention materials offered to the preschoolers will differ (with materials\noffered in Study 1 optimized on the basis of the findings of Study 1 and offered in optimized\nversion in Study 2).\nWP1: Recruitment. This WP involves demographic data and background characteristics of the\nparticipants (preschoolers) collected via a questionnaire. These will be scanned and stored as\n.pdf files and further inputted in a spreadsheet that is saved as .xls file. Data formats will be\ntextual and numerical. Estimated data volume: 200MB per study.\nWP2: Child competencies. This WP involves data about the participating children’s early\nmathematical and language competencies collected via paper-and-pencil and digital tasks. These\nwill be inputted in a spreadsheet that is saved as .xls file. Data formats will be textual and\nnumerical. Estimated data volume: 200MB per study.\nWP3: Interaction during the intervention. This WP involves data about the teacher-child\ninteractions during the intervention collected via audio-registered observations. These will be\nstored as mp4 files and literally transcribed as structured text that is stored as .docx file. Data\nformats will be audio and textual. Estimated data volume: 200GB per study.\n3. Ethical and legal issues\n3.1. Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you\nwill use. Add the reference to the file in KU Leuven's Record of Processing Activities.\nBe aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nPersonal data will be used.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 4\nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used: Personal data of the participants\nare name, sex, date-of-birth, contact information and signed informed consents. As we will\nobserve and audio-register teacher-child interactions during the intervention, this also involves\naudio data. All personal information is only available to researchers involved in recruitment, data\ncollection and data analysis. The file linking the code and personal identifiers is only accessible to\nthese researchers. It is stored on the J:\\ share of the project on KU Leuven network drives,\naccording to the ICTS storage guidelines. For the remainder of each study, all derivative data will\nbe coded, and thus pseudonymised. An ethics application for SMEC was already submitted and\napproved for the project as a whole (\nG-2021-3882-R2(MAR)\n). For each of the individual studies, a\nnew ethics application for SMEC will be submitted and registered via the PRET tool.\n3.2. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s).\nAn ethics application for SMEC was already submitted and approved for the project as a whole (\nG-\n2021-3882-R2(MAR)\n). For each of the individual studies, a new ethics application for SMEC will be\nsubmitted and registered via the PRET tool.\n3.3. Does your research possibly result in research data with potential for tech\ntransfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If\nso, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted?\nOur studies will result in effective instructional materials for preschoolers in the domain of early\nmathematics, to be offered to and published by an educational publisher. We are in contact with\nour colleagues with expertise related to IP at KU Leuven and will discuss all IP issues with them\nupon end of the project (before starting to contact educational publishers).\n3.4. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the\ndata you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions regarding\nreuse and sharing are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\n4.1. What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of the\ndata collected/generated in this project?\nWe will make a codebook documenting the study design, sampling, measures, variables and\nanalysis schemes that allows a secondary data analyst to use the data accurately and effectively.\nMetadata about the analytic techniques applied that is available in the statistical analysis\nsoftware will be included as well. For the observation data, the codebook will be complemented\nwith the data listing template available on https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-\ndata/document/data-level/qualitative.aspx.\n4.2. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be\nused. If not, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nWe will use the metadata standards from the Data Documentation Initiative for describing\nbehavioral data and data collected via observation methods, see https://ddialliance.org/about-\nthe-alliance.\n5. Data storage and backup during the C1-C2 project\n5.1. Where will the data be stored?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic daily back-up\nprocedures.\n5.2. How will the data be backed up?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic daily back-up\nprocedures.\n5.3. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes. \nThe J:\\ and K:\\ drives have sufficient storage for this project. The total estimated amount of data\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 4\nis 480 GB.\n5.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nThe estimated cost for back-up at J:\\ for 480 GB of data is approximately 385 euro. The\nestimated cost for storage at K:\\ during the project is approximately 50 euro. This will be paid by\nthe budget of the C3-project.\n5.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not\naccessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nThe data will be stored at the university's secure environment for private data, J:\\ and K:\\ drives,\nwhich will only be accessible by the involved researchers.\n6. Data preservation after the end of the C1-C2 project\n6.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the\nproject? If only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is\nthe case (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll data will be retained for the expected 10 year period.\n6.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)?\nOffline copies (questionnaires, paper-and-pencil data) and informed consents will be separately\narchived in a locked room for 10 years after the end of the project, as required by the KU Leuven\nRDM policy. They will be destroyed after the 10 year period.
