With EF being highly\ninfluenced by classroom quality, the focus on supporting EF in the preschool classroom has been on the rise. This specifically, in the context\nof supporting children from low socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds. Our project aims to research a classroom EF intervention in the Flemish\nearly childhood education. Firstly, we will determine the theoretical foundations, and look at the effects of the intervention on both children (EF\nand adjustment) and teacher (EF supporting behaviors) outcomes through a cluster RCT across schools in\na low SES student population, with attention for the implementation quality. However, current literature indicates that teacher-child relationships\n(TCR) play an important role in the effectiveness of classroom interventions delivered by teachers. Albeit research being scarce, the latest\nstudies suggest that low EF children have poorer TCR, and that these may hinder the effectiveness of interventions delivered by teachers. Therefore, we\nalso aim to obtain an in-depth description of TCR with low EF children using questionnaires and interviews with teachers. Furthermore, we\nwill examine the moderating role of the TCR in limiting/facilitating the intervention effects. Via this project we hope to improve Flanders’ preschool\neducation.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n25-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
