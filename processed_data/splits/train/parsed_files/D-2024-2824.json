However, within the agricultural sector\nand more specifically for the fruit industry, such automation is still lagging behind due to the cost and limitations of existing automation\nsolutions. The decreasing availability of seasonal workers and increasing cost of manual labour threatens the profitability of the Belgian\nfruit sector. This PhD aims to support this sector by developing affordable yet robust mobile navigation techniques in the challenging\noutdoor setting of orchards. The overall goal of this project is to make several step changes towards a fully autonomous mobile robot\ncapable of robustly navigating outdoors despite changing illumination, seasonal and weather conditions. The platform will be able to\nposition itself and navigate both globally in the orchard and relatively to trees or branches. To achieve this, the project pursues three main\nobjectives: (1) robust outdoor sensing and dataset construction; these sensors and datasets will be used in the next two objectives; (2)\nlifelong localisation and mapping with respect to trees and orchards using a semantic, adaptable map of the orchard; (3) outdoor\nsemantic navigation by adopting semantic knowledge about recognised objects when planning robot trajectories, and by storing the\neffects of robot control parameters into the map.\nLast modified: \n11-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
