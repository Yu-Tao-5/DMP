The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordina tion office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor -spokesperson throug h FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel.  Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.  \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. T his Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate  completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link\n.  \n \n \n    \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        2 \n 1.

Hyperexcitability is a  common pathologic feature and is \nassociated with a worse prognosis and shorter survival.  Nevertheless, the underlying molecular \ncauses and consequences remain undeciphered. Recent work  showed that hyperactive neurons \naccumulate toxic fatty acids (FAs), which are recaptured and degraded by  neighboring astrocytes \nin physiological conditions. I hypothesize that in ALS,  hyperactive neurons accumulate FAs, and \nastrocytes lose their buffering capacities. To test this  hypothesis, I will  perform a FA transfer assay \nusing a co -culture system with motor neurons and  astrocytes derived from ALS patients' iPSCs. \nOmics technologies will allow me to dissect molecular  mechanisms. I aim to prove the importance \nof FA toxicity in vivo using a mouse model of  ALS. Results will be a stepping stone to developing \nnew therapeutic strategies targeting FA  accumulation.  Furthermore, this approach is relevant for \nother neurodegenerative disorders, such as  Alzheimer’s  disease, which shows hyperexcitability.  \n \n                                                      \n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

    "clean_full_text": "FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 1 FWO DMP Template - Flemish Standard Data Management Plan Version KU Leuven Project supervisors (from application round 2018 onwards) and fellows (from application round 2020 onwards) will, upon being awarded their project or fellowship, be invited to de velop their answers to the data management related questions into a DMP. The FWO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordina tion office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor -spokesperson throug h FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. T his Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link .

Hyperexcitability is a common pathologic feature and is associated with a worse prognosis and shorter survival. Nevertheless, the underlying molecular causes and consequences remain undeciphered. Recent work showed that hyperactive neurons accumulate toxic fatty acids (FAs), which are recaptured and degraded by neighboring astrocytes in physiological conditions. I hypothesize that in ALS, hyperactive neurons accumulate FAs, and astrocytes lose their buffering capacities. To test this hypothesis, I will perform a FA transfer assay using a co -culture system with motor neurons and astrocytes derived from ALS patients' iPSCs. Omics technologies will allow me to dissect molecular mechanisms. I aim to prove the importance of FA toxicity in vivo using a mouse model of ALS. Results will be a stepping stone to developing new therapeutic strategies targeting FA accumulation. Furthermore, this approach is relevant for other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, which shows hyperexcitability. 1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

GUIDANCE : The data description forms the basis of your entire DMP, so make sure it is detailed and complete. It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all materials that need proper management because they are valuable, difficult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentation/metadata. RDM Guidance on data If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type . Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number. ☒ Yes, human subject data ; provide SMEC or EC a pproval number: S50354 ☒ Yes, animal data; provide ECD reference number: ECD not ye t accepted ☐ Yes, dual use; provide approval number : ☐ No Additional information : FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 8 3. Documentation and Metadata 4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan Will you process personal data 3F4? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number). ☒ Yes (provide PRET G -number or EC S -number below) ☐ No Additional information: S50354 Does y our work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin - offs, commercial exploitation, … )? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate . ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes , please comment : We do not exclude that t he proposed work could result in research data with potential for tech transfer - and valorization. VIB has a policy to actively monitor research data for such potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of cases the invention will be IP protected (mostly patent protection or copyright protection). As such the IP protection does not withhold the research data from being made public. In the case a decision is taken to file a patent application it wil l be planned so that publications need not be delayed. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements , research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to w hat data they relate and what restrictions are in place. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be ass erted. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9 Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in t he future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata . Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook t hat refer to speci fic datasets. All datasets will be accompanied by a README.txt file containing all the associated metadata. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD AS K TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULAR IES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : While specific data types might require particular metadata, as a general rule the metadata will be based on a generalized metadata schema such as Dublin Core or DataCite, including the following elements: • Title: free text • Creator: Last name, first name, organization • Date and time reference • Subject: Choice of keywords and classifications • Description: Text explaining the content of the data set and other contextual information needed for the correct interpretation of the data, the software(s) (including version number) used to produce and to read the data, the purpose of the experiment, etc. • Format: Details of the file format, • Resource Type: data set, image, audio, etc. • Identifier: DOI (when applicable) • Access rights: closed access, embargoed access, restricted access, open access. For specific datasets, additional metadata will be associated with the data file as appropria te such as experimental procedures to generate transcriptomic data. The final dataset will be accompanied by this information under the form of a README.txt document. This file will be located in the top level directory of the dataset and will also list th e contents of the other files and outline the file -naming convention used (see section 7 below). This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse. If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11 Where will the data be stored?

If no, please specify : How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COM PUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORE D AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data Both the L -drive and J -drive servers are accessible only by laboratory members, and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster r ecovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. Access to the digital vault is possible only through using a KU Leuven user -id and password, and user rights only grant access to the data in their own vault. Sensitive data transfer will be performed according to the best practices for “Copying data to the secure environment” defined by KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of upgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound by the ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. A security service monitors the technical installations continuously, even outside working hours. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12 What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Each year €738 will be charged from our ICT service for the use of 5 TB on the L -drive (long term storage) and €51,9 will be charged each year for the use of 100 GB of the J -drive (short term storage). Back -up service is included in the price. These costs are included in the lab budget . 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .).
