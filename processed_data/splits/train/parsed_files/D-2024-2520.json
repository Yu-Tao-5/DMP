Over the course of the past\ncentury, the right to freedom of movement was gradually incorporated in international law. Human rights law was supposed to guarantee mobility\nacross borders, and international conventions to protect refugees and stateless persons. As a result a large variety of legal statuses emerged, separating\nmigration from refugee history. This project will study the ideas and negotiations that led to the incorporation of freedom of movement clauses in\ninternational human rights law. It will do so from an international perspective, by concentrating on developments and actors in Latin America and in\nthe British world (including Britain’s (former) colonies in the Third World). The focus on freedom of movement allows me to bridge the gap between\nmigration and refugee history and to understand forces in favour as well as against human mobility. Ultimately, this project aspires to examine to what\nextent ideas and practices that emerged outside of the western world or that resulted from the interaction between the former coloniser and the\ncolonised had an impact on the formation of the current international order.\n \nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n29-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). P1-2-3: All the material collected in archives and libraries will be inserted in a FileMaker Database (D1) that is designed to include metadata. The database of archival sources always includes the following metadata: Name archive/library, name collection, box, document number, document title, date, creator Furthermore, to keep track of my progress in each collection, I will include an index of all the researched files in Excel and a README.txt file with the explanation of the content and usage of each collection (D3). These files are stored in a dedicated folder on KU Leuven's cloud service OneDrive for the duration of the project. Afterwards, these data will be stored on a secured KU Leuven server, together with the archival data, but they can also be made available through ManGo, the active data management platform of KU Leuven. D2: the Natural Language Processing results will be stored in Colab notebooks that include documentation on the process to derive the data.

Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? As it is obligatory at the Faculty of Arts to use a data repository, the historical data (P1-3) will be shared in closed access in RDR. The derivative data (D1-2-3) can be shared and are ideally embargoed until all publications related to this project are finalized and publicly available. They will also be stored in KU Leuven's RDR. Personal notes (D3) and zotero data (D4) will be stored and curated for the long-term in my own custody - either in my (home) office or on my personal devices. All data will also be backed-up on a personal harddrive for personal safekeeping and potential future use. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? This depends on the amount of data that I can upload to RDR on a yearly basis. 50GB per year is provided for free and I am not yet sure whether I will exceed that limit. If I do, I will discuss a financial strategy with my PI. 5. Data sharing and reuse 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?
