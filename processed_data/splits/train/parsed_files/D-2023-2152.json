The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Daan Dierickx (0000-0002-8917-022X) & Marlies Vanden Bempt (0000-0003-0111-0263)\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles\nProject number 1 & title Molecular characterization of genetic events driving development of peripheral T cell lymphoma  \nFunder(s) GrantID 2G056823N\nAffiliation(s) ☐ KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\nPlease provide a short project description Peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) is a form of blood cancer that  develops from mature T cells, a kind of \nwhite blood cells. These T  cells are growing uncontrollably, thereby forming a tumor that is  mostly located \nin the lymph nodes. PTCL patients are currently  treated with chemotherapy, but the chances of survival \nare only 30%. Therefore, there is a high clinical need for new therapeutic options for  these patients.\nWith this research project, we want to investigate the contribution of  specific genetic errors that we found  \nin PTCL patients. For this, we  will generate these specific genetic errors in mice, so that they will  develop T \ncell lymphomas. We can then use these mice to study the  exact mechanisms how these genetic errors \ndrive the development of  a lymphoma. We will use this knowledge to identify ways to  effectively block the  \ngrowth of these lymphomas with targeted drugs. Ultimately, we aim to uncover new therapeutic \nstrategies for PTCL  patients.\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number. This question is optional.
