Whereas previous work has found evidence for domain- general ability using signal detection measures, we have shown that these measures are confounded with response caution8. Importantly, humans tend to set similar levels of response caution for different tasks20. Therefore, it is not clear whether the state-of-the-art is measuring domain- general metacognition, or instead just domain- general response caution Reuse existing data Digital Experimental .csv <1GB Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 15 April 2024 5 of 10 WP2 In WP2, I will examine the hypothesis that second-order confidence can be treated like a first-order decision, and therefore is also under strategic control (with regards to speed and accuracy). To this end, I will extend the v- ratio model to include a second-order confidence response boundary as described above (Fig. 3-4). Experimentally, I will examine the influence of biasing either speed or accuracy of confidence reports on behavior and on the confidence reports. Generate new data Digital Experimental .csv <1GB WP3 I will use the experimental design of WP2 and adapt it for an EEG study. Using a decoding approach, I will extract single-trial estimates of the Pe component (thought to reflect post-decisional evidence accumulation) and single-trial estimates of the CPP component (thought to reflect the pre-decision evidence accumulation process). When fitting our hierarchical version of the extended v-ratio model to these data, I will allow the pre- decisional drift rate to vary as a function of single-trial CPP estimates, and the post-decisional drift rate to vary as a function of single-trial Pe estimates (i.e., our main model of interest).

Yes BIDS will be used for neuroimaging data. It is a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations (Gorgolewski, Auer, Calhoun, V. et al.). This facilitates data sharing with other researchers. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored?
