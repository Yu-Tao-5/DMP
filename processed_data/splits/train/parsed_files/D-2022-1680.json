Next, lignin oils from numerous and identical RCF reactions\nare mixed to obtain a master batch, after which sequential solvent extraction is performed with\nvarying ratios of hexane and ethyl acetate to further separate different molecules present in the\ninitial mixture of lignin oil. Different fractions will be obtained after each iteration of the solvent\ncomposition and are characterized with gas- and liquid chromatography techniques as well as\nNMR to identify and quantify its constituents. Each fraction is shared with CMPG to identify which\nfractions retain their ISR activity. \n1\n. \noverviewing experimental sheet (word-file)\nstarting from a standard template file containing\nthe following information :\nGeneral information: experimental set-up, goal, date and researchers involved\nExperimental conditions:\nRCF conditions: catalyst type and loading, solvent type and loading, biomass type,\ntemperature and duration of the experiment\nSolvent extraction: Solvent composition and amounts, temperature and time\nAmounts of oils and fractions obtained in separate experiments\nResults:\nObtained results from GC analysis (.pdf files)\nAnalysis methods, oil yields and compositions (.xls files)\nGraphical presentation of the data (statistical analysis and graphs, .pzfx files)\nShort description of the results\nConclusions and next steps\n2\n. \nRaw data\n: All numerical data is stored in .xls files\n3\n. \nData processing and graphical representation\n: graphpad prism and stored in .pzfx files\n \nDescribe the metadata for the data.
