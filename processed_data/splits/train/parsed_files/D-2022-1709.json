The behavioral variant (bvFTD) forms alongside two other language forms the three main  \nclinical syndromes of FTD. In 2011, diagnostic criteria were established for bvFTD. This includes six features, i.e. \nearly behavioral disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, compulsive/ritualistic behavior, hyperorality, and deficits in \nexecutive neuropsychological tasks. Though three out of six behavioral changes suffice for a clinical diagnosis, the \ndetection of bvFTD remains problematic due to its heterogeneity in symptoms and lack of biomarkers. As a result, \npatients with bvFTD in its early stages are often misdiagnosed with primary psychiatric disorders or other \nneurodegenerative cognitive disorders. Having substantial consequences for the quality of life for both the patients \nand their relatives, early diagnosis is crucial to delay institutionalization, prepare caregivers, and allow future \ntherapies to take maximum effects. The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \n(DSM-V) has included social cognitive deficits as a functional domain that may be affected in neurocognitive \ndisorders. Social cognition is an umbrella term for a set of mental abilities enabling individuals to process, interpret \nand utilize information about others in a social environment. In terms of bvFTD, deteriorated social cognition refers to \na reduced ability in (i) recognizing facial emotions, (ii) detecting and reasoning violations of social norms, and (iii) \ninferring mental states of others (mentalizing or theory of mind). Displays of these behavioral impairments such as \ninappropriate behaviors are often subtle signs of early bvFTD. Despite its diagnostic potential, insufficient study \ncomparability does not allow valid clinical translation, and the assessment of social cognition remains currently \nunderutilized in clinical practice.\nSocial cognitive skills imply an underlying socio-cultural norm that guides socially appropriate behavior. However, \ninvestigations on the relationship between culture and impaired social cognitive skills in neuropsychiatric disorders \nremain scant. Previous findings showed differences in emotion recognition performance in patients with mental \ndisorders and different cultural backgrounds. One particular study in schizophrenia patients reported that cultural \ndifferences in emotion recognition are more extreme in patient groups. They argue that the significantly lower scores \nof their Indian patients are caused by unfamiliarity with the stimuli using Caucasian faces.\nWhile extensive studies have been conducted to investigate differences in cognition, not much has yet been \ninvestigated regarding impaired social cognitive skills of dementia patients with distinct behavioral deficits such as \nbvFTD. This existing gap in the literature is thus worth further investigation. To fill this gap, we intend to explore the \nrelationship between culture and social cognitive deficits in bvFTD patients by comparing early social cognitive \nsymptoms across two culturally distinct sites (Belgium vs China). We aim to (i) determine different early behavioral \nsymptoms through a semi-structured interview with caregivers of bvFTD patients across two sites in China and \nBelgium. Through comparison, we want to explore the similarities and differences in symptom types and progress. \nBased on the retrieved results, we will develop (ii) a questionnaire to measure the symptom impact on early affected \nlife domains. The results will then be validated (iii) through an exploration of its neuroanatomical correlates.\nLast modified: 22-05-2023\nPROSPECTIVE NON-INTERVENTIONAL STUDY\nRESEARCH DATA SUMMARY\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your \nresearch project.
