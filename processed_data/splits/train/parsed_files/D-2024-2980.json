How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? In the services offered by the university (Local server of Cloud via OneDrive of KUL) the access to the data can be strictly authorized to only researcher involved directly in project execution. The Multilayer OneDrive folder will be created and managed by CSCE project responsible and will have following structure: 1 . 1 protected folder containing all data - only manager (and PI) can consult and add/modify data 2 . 1 folder with read-only rights for researchers to check data collected by team - researchers can see data, copy data to their local storage space, but can't add or modify 3 . 1 folder with \"edit\" rights for researchers as \"input\" folder - researcher can deposit new data; manager needs to copy manually data from input to other 2 folders, which will be done every month Created using DMPonline.be.
