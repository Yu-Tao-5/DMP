Data Description\nWhat data will you collect or create? Fill out the table below and/or describe.\n Type of data\nFormat \n Volume\nHow created? \n e.g observational,\nexperimental,\nreference data,...\n e.g. textual,\nnumerical,\nmultimedia\n e.g\n200MB,\n1GB\n Computer task, observations, blood sample,\n...\n Microscopy images\n tif or jpeg\n up to\n10G\n Microscope images of device structures in\nlarge areas, to help integration team to\ndefine the process\n Scanning electron\nmicroscope images\n tif or jpeg\n up to\n10G\n To look into device center to define the size\nof nanopore, or crosssection image of the\ndevice structure\n Transmission\nelectron microscope\nimages\n tif or jpeg\n up to\n10G\n To check the exact size of nanopore, and the\ncrossection of nanopore\nElectrical\ncharacterization\ncurves\nxlsx or csv or opju\nup to\n100G\ndevice characterization data from probe\nstation\nNanopore\ncharacterization\ncurves\ntdms or pdf or\npython script\nup to\n300G\nNanopore characterization raw data from lab\nFET and nanopore co-\nrelated data\ntdms or pdf or\npython script or\nopju format\nup to\n300G\nNanopore co-related FET data for biosensing,\nincluding raw data and data after processed\nDo you intend to reuse existing data?\nYes, only for analyzing and comparison or benchmarking, I will specify the source and copyright if\nit's needed.\nDo you use personal data (i.e. all data possibly identifying an individual)?\nNo\nUsually not necessary to possibly identify an individual\n2. Documentation and Metadata\nDescribe the documentation that will be created for the data. This section deals with\nthe way in which you will document how the dataset was created and subsequently\nprocessed.\n1. For images (microscope, SEM, TEM, XSEM and so on), the date, labels, the key information of\neach images will be added as the key information within these image saved format.\n2. For electrical characterization data, usually, the CSV or xlsx file will contain the key\nmeasurement variables, measurement conditions (i.e. temperature, measurement type for\nexample if it is an automatic run), time and date, and the number or orders of the device values\nin the begining of the CSV file. And I will put also some notes accompany with the original CSV\nfile for people (me myself mainly) to process and visualize the data through other tools such as\nthe opju generated by originalab.\n3. For other data, for example nanopore data, there are always notes together with tdms file\ngenerated by labview for every single measurement. All the possible condition for experiment\nand the different phonomena will be recorded.\nDescribe the metadata for the data. This section deals with metadata: information\ncontained in your dataset about the research data.\nOne of the main data file is tdms, which contains both matadata and raw data. For example,\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 3\nsample ID and notes all acompany with the data points with different recording time and date.\nI will use python script to read and output visualized plots\n3.

Data selection and Preservation after Research\nWhat is the long-term preservation plan for these dataset(s)?\nUsually, imec use onedrive, sharepoint, github.imec.be for standard data storage and\nmanagement and usually for a quite long time longer than 5 years. \nData Selection: Which data will have long time value for the research and will be\npreserved?\nCSV file for electrical measurement as well as tdms file for nanopore measurement are the most\nkey data for this project and they are worth preserving for long time.\nThe meaning of these data is for possible analyzing with future experiment potentially for other\nresearchers with same or similar topics for comparison and benchmarking\n6.

Data Selection: Which data will have long time value for the research and will be preserved? CSV file for electrical measurement as well as tdms file for nanopore measurement are the most key data for this project and they are worth preserving for long time. The meaning of these data is for possible analyzing with future experiment potentially for other researchers with same or similar topics for comparison and benchmarking 6.

Also, my advisor, Pol Van Dorpe will have the access to all data and can also decide which part can be shared. If there are no restrictions, which mechanisms will be in place to assure that the data are discoverable, accessible and intelligible? The data folder will be created in onedrive for storing all raw data. Each data has specific time, date, and notes, and it should be available for tracing back the exact experiment. The data format is usually easy to be processed and read by third parties How will you share the data? Publication Other, specify The most important way to share the data is through publication, for example journal articles or letters. Also, for some step progress, conference meeting presentations and posters are also ways for sharing the data With whom will the data be shared?
