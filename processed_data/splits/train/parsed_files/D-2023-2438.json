Non-metallic inclusions (NMIs) are however inevitable in the\nsteelmaking process and are generally considered to be detrimental to steel properties, such as toughness, ductility, and fatigue strength of the steel, as\nwell as its corrosion resistance. This project focuses on the behavior of NMIs at the steel/slag interface, which is crucial for inclusion removal. More\nspecifically, we will investigate the aggregation of inclusions at the steel/slag interface and the separation process across the interface. In situ confocal\nscanning laser microscope observation will be applied to study the aggregation behaviors. The colloidal probe atomic force microscopy will be carried\nout to study the separation process. Finally, a numerical model will be developed to quantify the inclusion removal efficiency by taking into account\nthe aggregation and separation phenomenon. The obtained insights in slag and inclusion systems with a high inclusion removal efficiency are crucial to\ndeveloping clean steel production processes.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n08-02-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
