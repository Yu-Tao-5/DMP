Pathologically, AD is characterized by the \nextensive deposition of abnormal proteins in the brain, namely amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques \nand Tau tangles.  While Aβ is the initiating trigger of the cascade leading to neuronal loss \nin AD, Tau is spatiotemporally correlated with brain atrophy, cognitive decline and \nnecroptotic signatures. Neuronal necroptosis has recently been described in AD, and it is \nexecut ed by the activation of the necrosome complex, composed of three key \nphosphorylated proteins: pRIPK1, pRIPK3 and pMLKL. Multiple studies indicate that \npRIPK1 is the initiator of necrosome assembly. Research in our lab verifies its activation \nin AD patients  and humanized models. However, the exact mechanism of pRIPK1 -\nmediated activation of the necrosome complex in AD has not been investigated. \nFurthermore, whether this mechanism is triggered downstream or in parallel to Tau \npathology is unknown. In this proj ect, we will test a functional link between Tau and \nnecroptosis by using stem cell engineering to generate  human neurons in our chimeric \nAD model, and to employ proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis in wild type human \nneuronal xenografts to elucidate the  mechanisms that lead to activation of necroptosis in \nAD. This represents an unparalleled approach to elucidate the mechanisms leading to \nnecroptotic neurodegeneration in AD.  \n \n1.

Legal  and ethical  issues  \n \nWill you use personal  data?  If so, shortly  describe  the kind of personal  data you                  \nwill use. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data  \nProcessing  for Research  and Public  Service  Purposes  (PRET  application).  Be \naware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal  \nobligation.  \n \n \n• Yes  \n \nShort  description  of the kind of personal  data that will be used:  \n \nWe use commercially available stem cells where the genotype and gender is the only \npersonal data known. For the use of commercial stem cell lines we follow the ethical \napplication (S62888) with the following PRET application: G -2021 -3588  \n \n \nAre there  any ethical  issues  concerning  the creation  and/or  use of the data (e.g. \nexperiments  on humans  or animals,  dual use)?  If so, add the reference  to the \nformal  approval  by the relevant  ethical  review  committee(s)  \n \n \n• Yes \n \n \n \n4 of 10  Project  license  number:  165/2017   \nProject  license  name:  Role of TAU in human -specific neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s \nDisease  \nGenetically modified organisms: All experiments are conducted according to \nprotocols approved by the local Ethical Committee of Laboratory Animals of the \nKU Leuven (government license LA1210579 , ECD project number 165/2017 ) \nfollowing local and EU guideline s. Animals are housed in facilities of the \nLaboratory Animal Center of KU Leuven, which applies Standard Operation \nProcedures concerning housing, feeding, health monitoring to assure consistent \ncare in accordance with European and national regulations and guidelines. \nAnimal administrative, husbandry and animal welfare data are sensitive data \nand are stored in the LAIS database according to security procedure of KU \nLeuven. For the use of commercial stem cell lines we follow the ethical \napplication ( S62888) w ith the following PRET application: G -2021 -3588  \n \n \n \nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer  \nand valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so,  \nfor what  data and which  restrictions  will be asserted?  \n \n• Yes \n \n \nWe do not exclude that the proposed work could result in research data with potential for \ntech transfer and valorization. VIB has a policy to actively monitor research data for such \npotential. If there is substantial potential, the  invention will be thoroughly assessed, and \nin a number of cases the invention will be IP protected (mostly patent protection or \ncopyright protection). As such the IP protection does not withhold the research data from \nbeing made public. In the case a deci sion is taken to file a patent application it will be \nplanned so that publications need not be delayed.  \n \nDo existing  3rd party  agreements  restrict  dissemination  or exploitation  of the \ndata you (re)use?  If so, to what  data do they relate  and what  restrictions  are in \nplace?  \n \n• No \n \nNo third -party agreement restricts dissemination or exploitation of the data from this \nproject. In particular, existing agreements between VIB and KU Leuven do not restrict \npublication of data.  \n \n \n4. Documentation  and metadata  \n5 of 10  What documentation  will be provided  to enable  reuse  of the data   \ncollected/generated  in this project?  \n \nData will be generated following standardized protocols. Metadata will be documented   by the \nresearch  and technical  staff at the time of data collection  and analysis,  by taking  careful notes \nin the Electronic L aboratory Notebook ( ELN) and/or in hard copy lab  notebooks  that refer to \nspecific  datasets.  \nCryotubes of biological samples ( brain samples, cell lines ) will be  labelled  with a reference  \nnumber  that links them to our Sample Storage Manager  (SSM)  database.  \nAll datasets  will be accompanied  by a README.txt  file containing  all the associated  metadata  \n(see more  details  below).  \nClear  and detailed     descriptions of the  protocols used will be published  along  with the \nresults.  \n \nWill a metadata  standard  be used?  If so, describe  in detail  which  standard  will be \nused. If no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data  \neasy/easier  to find and reuse.  \n \n• Yes \n \nWhile specific data types might require particular metadata, as a general rule the metadata will \nbe based on a generalized metadata schema such as Dublin Core or DataCite, including the \nfollowing elements:  \n \n• Title: free text \n• Creator:  Last name,  first name,  organization  Date  and time reference  \n• Subject:  Choice  of keywords  and classifications  \n• Description: Text explaining  the content of the  data set and  other contextual  information  \nneeded  for the correct  interpretation  of the data,  the software(s)  (including  version  \nnumber)  used to produce  and to read the data,  the purpose  of the experiment,  etc. \n• Format:  Details  of the file format,  \n• Resource  Type:  data set, image,  audio,  etc. Identifier:  DOI (when  applicable)  \n• Access  rights:  closed  access,  embargoed  access,  restricted  access,  open  access.  \n \nFor specific datasets, additional metadata will be associated with the data file as appropriate. When \ndepositing data in a repository, the final dataset will be accompanied by this information unde r the \nform of a README.txt document. This file will be located in the top -level directory of the dataset and \nwill also list the contents of the other files and outline the file -naming convention used. This will allow \nthe data to be understood by other memb ers of the laboratory and add contextual value to the \ndataset for future reuse.  \n \n5. Data  storage  and backup  during  the FWO  project  \n \nWhere  will the data be stored?  \n \n- Digital  files will be stored  on KU Leuven  servers  (“L-drive”).  \n- Tissue  samples:  Tissues  will be stored  locally  in the laboratory  and labelled with a reference \n6 of 10  number that links them to our Sample Storage Manager (SSM) database . All human \ntissue samples will be registered with a Belgian biobank, in compliance with the Belgian law on \nhuman body material (dd19 -12-2008).   \n- Cell lines: Newly created human pluripotent cell lines will be deposited in the hPSCreg \ndatabase. Other cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory , in cryotubes labelled \nwith a reference number that links them to our Samp le Storage Manager (SSM) \ndatabase.  \n- Omics  data:  omics  data generated  during  the project  will either  be stored  on KU \nLeuven servers or on The Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC), initially in the  \nstaging  area and later in the archive  area.  \n-Genetically  modified  organisms:  Mice will be maintained  in facilities  of the Laboratory  Animal \nCenter of KU Leuven, which applies Standard Operation Procedures  concerning housing, \nfeeding, health monitoring to assure consistent care in  accordance  with European  and \nnational  regulations  and guidelines.  All animals  will be registered in the Leuven Animal \nInformation System (LAIS) database, along with  corresponding  genotyping  information, \nethical  approval  documents and  animal  provider  receipts.  \n- Other  biological  and chemical  samples:  storage  at 4°C, and/or  as frozen  samples  in  \ncryovials  at -20°C and -80°C  as appropriate.  \n- Algorithms, scripts and  softwares: All  the relevant algorithms, scripts and  software  code \ndriving  the project  will be stored  in a private  online  git repository  from the GitHub  account  of \nthe department  (https://github.com/vibcbd).  \n- Nucleic acid and protein sequences: All nucleic acid and protein sequences  generated  \nduring  the project will  be stored  on KU Leuven  servers. Upon  publication,  all sequences  \nsupporting  a manuscript  will be made  publicly  available  via repositories  such as the GenBank \ndatabase or the European Nucleotide Archive (nucleotide  sequences from primers / new \ngenes / new genomes), NCBI Gene Expression  Omnibus  (microarray  data / RNA-seq data / \nCHIPseq  data),  the Protein  Database  (for protein sequences), the EBI European Genome -\nphenome Archive (EGA) for  personally  identifiable  (epi)genome  and transcriptome  \nsequences.  \n \nHow  is backup  of the data provided?  \n \nKU Leuven drives are backed -up according to the following scheme:  \n \n• Data stored on the “L -drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where \nall incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last \n14 bac kups are kept.  \n• Data stored on the “J -drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and \nweekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 \nbackups are kept.  \n• Data stored on the digital vault is backed up using snapshot te chnology, where all \nincremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. As \nstandard, 10% of the requested storage is reserved for backups using the following \nbackup regime: an hourly backup (at 8 a.m., 12 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.), the l ast 6 \nof which are kept; a daily backup (every day) at midnight, the last 6 of which are \nkept; and a weekly backup (every week) at midnight between Saturday and \nSunday, the last 2 of which are kept.  \n7 of 10  • All omics data stored on the Flemish Supercomputer Centr e (VSC) will be \ntransferred on a weekly basis to the archive area which is backed up.  \n \n \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,  \nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available  \nthen  explain  how this will be taken  care of. \n \n• Yes \n \nAll data will be stored  at servers  managed  by KU Leuven  where  storage  space  can be \nincreased  if necessary.  \n \n \nWhat  are the expected  costs  for data storage  and back  up during  the project?  \nHow  will these  costs  be covered?  \n \n• The total estimated cost of data storage during the project is about 4000€ (for a \nfinal volume of 5 TB). This estimation is based on the following costs:  \n• The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 173,78€/TB/Year for the “L -\ndrive” and 519€/TB/Year for the “J -drive”.  \n• Maintaining a mouse colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), \nexcluding the costs of genotyping. When no experiment is planned with a \nparticular mouse strain, and in compliance with the 3R’s rule \n(https://www.nc3rs.org .uk), cryopreservation will thus be used to safeguard the \nstrain, prevent genetic drift, loss of transgene and potential infections or \nbreeding problems. Cryopreservation of sperm/embryos costs about 500 to 700 \neuro per genotype, plus a minimal annual stor age fee (25 euro per strain for 250 \nto 500 embryos). Frozen specimen are kept in two separate liquid nitrogen \ntanks at two different sites on campus. When necessary, the costs of \nrevitalization from cryopreserved sperm/embryos are about 1,100/600 euro.  \n• Electricity costs for the -80° freezers present in the labs are included in general \nlab costs.  \n• Data storage and backup costs are included in general lab cost  \n \n \nData  security: how  will you ensure  that the  data are securely  stored  and not \naccessed or  modified  by unauthorized persons?  \n \n \nBoth the “L -drive” and “J -drive” servers are accessible only by laboratory members and are \nmirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a \ncopy of the data can be recovered within an hour.  Access to the digital vault is possible only \nthrough using a KU Leuven user -id and password, and user rights only grant access to the data in \ntheir own vault. Sensitive data transfer will be performed according to the best practices for \n“Copying data to the secure environment” defined by KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault \nis maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of upgrades and security patches. The \nserver in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound by the ICT code of \nconduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. A security service monitors the technical \n8 of 10  installations continuously, even outside working hours.All private data will be rendered anonymous \nbefore processing outside the digital vault. Only the PI will be granted access to the server to \ndeposit private data. The PI will be the only responsible for linking patient information, survey data \nand/or tissue samples, and will strictly respect confidentiality. All de -identified data will be exported \nfrom the database by the PI, and stored on KU Leuven servers from where it can be accessed by \nthe research and technical staff from the laboratory.  \n \n \n6. Data  preservation  after  the FWO  project  \n \nWhich  data will be retained  for the expected  5 year period  after  the end of the \nproject?  In case  only a selection  of the data can/will  be preserved,  clearly  state  \nthe reasons  for this  (legal  or contractual  restrictions,  physical  preservation  \nissues,  ...). \n \nThe minimum  preservation  term of 5 years  after the end of the project  will be applied  to all \ndatasets. All  datasets  will be stored  on the university's  central  servers  with automatic back -up \nprocedures for at least 5 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM  policy.  \n \n \n \nWhere  will the data be archived  (= stored  for the longer  term)?  \n \nAs a general  rule, datasets  will be made  openly accessible,  whenever  possible  via existing  \nplatforms  that support FAIR  data sharing  (www.fairsharing.org ), at the  latest at  the time of \npublication. For all  other datasets, long  term storage  will be ensured  as follows:  \n• Digital datasets: files will be stored on the “L -drive”.  \n• Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory.  \n• Omics data: datasets will be stored on the “L -drive” or, for larger datasets, on \nthe Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum.  \n• Cell lines: cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory ( -80°C).  \n• Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be \npreserved for each vector, both under the form of p urified DNA (in -20°C \nfreezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock ( -80°C).  \n• Genetically modified organisms: All other lines that are no actively used for \nexperiments will be cryopreserved.  \n• Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen  \nsamples in cryovials as appropriate  \n \nWhat are  the expected  costs  for data preservation  during  the retention  period  of \n5 years?  How  will the costs  be covered?  \n \nThe total estimated cost of data storage during the project is about 4000€ (for a final volume of \n9 of 10  5 TB). This estimation is based on the following costs:  \n• The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 173,78€/TB/Year for the “L -drive” and \n519€/TB/Year for the “J -drive”.  \n• Maintaining a mouse colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), \nexcluding the costs of genotyping. When no experiment is planned with a particular \nmouse strain, and in compliance with the 3R’s rule (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk), \ncryopreservation will thus be used to safeguard the strain, prevent genetic drift, loss of \ntransgene and potential infections or breeding problems. Cryopreservation of \nsperm/embryos costs about 500 to 700 euro per genotype, plus a minimal annual \nstorage fee (25 euro per strain for 250 to 500 embryos). Frozen specimen are kept in \ntwo separate liquid nitrogen tanks at two different sites on campus. When necessary, \nthe costs of revitalization from cryop reserved sperm/embryos are about 1,100/600 euro.\n10 of 10  7. Data  sharing  and reuse  \n \nAre there  any factors  restricting  or preventing  the sharing  of (some  of) the data \n(e.g. as defined  in an agreement  with a 3rd party,  legal  restrictions)?  \n \n \n• No \n \nWhich  data will be made  available  after  the end of the project?  \n \nParticipants  to the present  project  are committed  to publish  research  results  to communicate \nthem to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting  publications will be \nmade openly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data  may be made  available  \nprior to publication,  either  on an individual  basis  to interested  researchers and/or potential \nnew collaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g.  negative  data).  \n \nWhere/how  will the data be made  available  for reuse?  \n \n• In an Open  Access  repository  \n• Upon  request  by mail \n• Other (specify):  \n \nOpen -access publications in peer -reviewed journals, including supplemental \ninformationAs a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible via existing \nplatforms that support FAIR data sharing ( www.fairsharing.org). Sharing policies for \nspecific research outputs are detailed below:  \n \n• Omics datasets will be deposited in open access repositories such as the PRIDE \nArchive for proteomi cs data, the EMBL -EBI platform for genomics and \nepigenomics data, or the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) or the EBI \nArrayExpress databases for functional genomics data.  \n• Vectors: Upon publication, all vectors supporting a manuscript will be made \npublicly available via the non -profit plasmid repository Addgene, along with the \ncorresponding DNA sequences. Addgene in turn, performs quality control on the \nDNA, curates the plasmids online with all relevant information (maps, \nsequences), and for a minim al cost (typically $65) ships the vectors upon simple \nrequest and signature of a material transfer agreement. The MTA will be \nprepared before depositing the vectors with the help of our organization’s Tech \nTransfer office. For transfer between nonprofit or  academic institutions, Addgene \ntypically uses the Uniform Biological Material Transfer Agreement \n(https://www.addgene.org/terms/1047/). All non -published vectors and the \nassociated documentation will be shared by the PI upon request and after \nsignature of  a material transfer agreement, at no cost except the cost of \nshipment.  \n• Cell lines: All human pluripotent cell lines supporting publications will be \n10 of 10  registered in hPSCreg, the European human embryonic stem cell registry \nsupported by the European Commission  (https://hpscreg.eu/). Information about \nthe deposited lines (including donor information, derivation method, availability \nand characterization) will also be made accessible. Registration of cell lines in \nhPSCreg will provide visibility, confirm ethical p rocurement and facilitate \ncomparison with other hPSC lines. The PI will remain the distributor of the \npluripotent cell lines. All other cell lines supporting publications will be deposited \nin the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) database \n(https://ww w.atcc.org/), which is a private, non -profit biological resource center. \nThis will provide a secure back -up for this material. Investigators can purchase \ncell lines from the ATCC database upon signature of a material transfer \nagreement (https://www.lgcstan dards -atcc.org/~/media/PDFs/MTA_2.ashx) and, \nin some cases, of a Limited Use/Label License (e.g. for CRISPR products or \niPSC materials) and/or a Customer Acceptance of Responsibility (for potentially \nhighly pathogenic materials). Information about the cell  lines (including organism, \ncell type, tissue, biosafety level and disease if applicable) will also be made \naccessible.  \n• Genetically modified organisms: All genetically modified organisms used in \npublications will be made available to researchers upon reque st at the time of \npublication.  \n• Other digital datasets that support publications (including image, video or audio \nfiles, electrophysiology data, cytometry data, spectroscopy data and simulation \ndata) will be made publicly available via an open research data  platform such as \nMendeley Data or Zenodo.  \n• Synthetic and recombinant compounds: samples will be stored as appropriate in \nthe laboratory. Within availability, they will be shared with interested researchers \nupon request.  \n• Research documentation: All protocol s used to generate published data will be \ndescribed in the corresponding manuscript(s), and the related documentation will \nbe included as supplementary information. These data and all other documents \n(daily logs, raw data) deposited in the E -Notebook are a ccessible to the PI and \nthe research staff, and will be made available upon request.  \n• Manuscripts: All scientific publications will be shared openly. Manuscripts \nsubmitted for publication will be deposited in a pre -print server such as bioRxiv, \narXiv, Natur e Precedings or ASAPbio. At the time of publication, research results \nwill be summarized on the PI’s website and post -print pdf versions of publications \nwill be made available there if allowed by copyright agreements, possibly after an \nembargo as determine d by the publisher. Before the end of the embargo or in \ncases where sharing the post -print is not allowed due to copyright agreements, a \npre-print version of the manuscript will be made available. Publications will also \nbe automatically added to our instit utional repository, Lirias 2.0, based on the \nauthors name and ORCID ID.  \n• Algorithms, scripts and software: All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software \ncode driving the project will be stored in a private online git repository from the \nGitHub account o f the department (https://github.com/vibcbd). As soon as the \n10 of 10  manuscript is publicly available, the repository will be changed to a public \nrepository.  \n• Nucleic acid and protein sequences: All nucleic acid and protein sequences \ngenerated during the project wi ll be stored on KU Leuven servers. Upon \npublication, all sequences supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available \nvia repositories such as the GenBank database or the European Nucleotide \nArchive (nucleotide sequences from primers / new genes / new  genomes), NCBI \nGene Expression  \n• Omnibus (microarray data / RNA -seq data / CHIPseq data), the Protein Database \n(for protein sequences).  \n• Protein structures: Upon publication, all structures supporting a manuscript will be \nmade publicly available as supportin g information and via the Protein Data Bank \nin Europe (PDBe) database. Coordinate sets produced by X -ray crystallography / \nNMR / electron microscopy / neutron diffraction / powder diffraction / fiber \ndiffraction will be deposited to the PDBe together with the corresponding \nmetadata (project acronym, author contact information, context and method of \ndata collection, information about the sequence, chemistry, etc.). Datasets will be \ncited using the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) link generated by the PDBe, a nd will \nalso be accessible via the elaborate search function available via PDBe.Data that \ndo not support publication will be either deposited in an open access repository or \nmade available upon request by email  \n \nWhen  will the data be made  available?  \n \n• Upon  publication  of the research  results  \n \nAs a general rule, all research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at  the \ntime of publication. No  embargo  will be foreseen  unless imposed  e.g. by pending  publications, \npotential  IP requirements – note that patent application  filing will be planned  so that \npublications need  not be  delayed  - or ongoing  projects requiring  confidential data. In those \ncases, datasets will be made publicly available as soon as  the embargo  date is reached.  \n \n \nWho  will be able to access  the data and under  what  conditions?  \n \nWhenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly  available \nthrough repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above,  metadata  will contain  \nsufficient information  to support data  interpretation  and reuse,  and will be conform to  \ncommunity norms. These  repositories clearly describe  their conditions  of use (typically  under  a \nCreative  Commons  CC0 1.0 Universal  (CC0  1.0) Public  Domain  Dedication, a  Creative  \nCommons  Attribution  (CC-BY) or an ODC  Public Domain Dedication and Licence, with a \nmaterial transfer agreement when  applicable).  Interested  parties  will thereby  be allowed  to \naccess  data directly,  and they will give credit to  the authors for the  data used by citing  the \ncorresponding  DOI. For  data shared  directly  by the PI, a material  transfer  agreement  (and a \nnon-disclosure  agreement  if applicable)  will be concluded  with the beneficiaries  in order  to \nclearly  describe  the types  of reuse  that are permitted.  \n10 of 10   \n \n \nWhat are  the expected  costs  for data sharing?

Pathologically, AD is characterized by the extensive deposition of abnormal proteins in the brain, namely amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and Tau tangles. While Aβ is the initiating trigger of the cascade leading to neuronal loss in AD, Tau is spatiotemporally correlated with brain atrophy, cognitive decline and necroptotic signatures. Neuronal necroptosis has recently been described in AD, and it is execut ed by the activation of the necrosome complex, composed of three key phosphorylated proteins: pRIPK1, pRIPK3 and pMLKL. Multiple studies indicate that pRIPK1 is the initiator of necrosome assembly. Research in our lab verifies its activation in AD patients and humanized models. However, the exact mechanism of pRIPK1 - mediated activation of the necrosome complex in AD has not been investigated. Furthermore, whether this mechanism is triggered downstream or in parallel to Tau pathology is unknown. In this proj ect, we will test a functional link between Tau and necroptosis by using stem cell engineering to generate human neurons in our chimeric AD model, and to employ proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis in wild type human neuronal xenografts to elucidate the mechanisms that lead to activation of necroptosis in AD. This represents an unparalleled approach to elucidate the mechanisms leading to necroptotic neurodegeneration in AD. 1.

Legal and ethical issues Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for Research and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). Be aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation. • Yes Short description of the kind of personal data that will be used: We use commercially available stem cells where the genotype and gender is the only personal data known. For the use of commercial stem cell lines we follow the ethical application (S62888) with the following PRET application: G -2021 -3588 Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant ethical review committee(s) • Yes 4 of 10 Project license number: 165/2017 Project license name: Role of TAU in human -specific neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s Disease Genetically modified organisms: All experiments are conducted according to protocols approved by the local Ethical Committee of Laboratory Animals of the KU Leuven (government license LA1210579 , ECD project number 165/2017 ) following local and EU guideline s. Animals are housed in facilities of the Laboratory Animal Center of KU Leuven, which applies Standard Operation Procedures concerning housing, feeding, health monitoring to assure consistent care in accordance with European and national regulations and guidelines. Animal administrative, husbandry and animal welfare data are sensitive data and are stored in the LAIS database according to security procedure of KU Leuven. For the use of commercial stem cell lines we follow the ethical application ( S62888) w ith the following PRET application: G -2021 -3588 Does your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted? • Yes We do not exclude that the proposed work could result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorization. VIB has a policy to actively monitor research data for such potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of cases the invention will be IP protected (mostly patent protection or copyright protection). As such the IP protection does not withhold the research data from being made public. In the case a deci sion is taken to file a patent application it will be planned so that publications need not be delayed. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place? • No No third -party agreement restricts dissemination or exploitation of the data from this project. In particular, existing agreements between VIB and KU Leuven do not restrict publication of data. 4. Documentation and metadata 5 of 10 What documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this project? Data will be generated following standardized protocols. Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the Electronic L aboratory Notebook ( ELN) and/or in hard copy lab notebooks that refer to specific datasets. Cryotubes of biological samples ( brain samples, cell lines ) will be labelled with a reference number that links them to our Sample Storage Manager (SSM) database. All datasets will be accompanied by a README.txt file containing all the associated metadata (see more details below). Clear and detailed descriptions of the protocols used will be published along with the results. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used. If no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse. • Yes While specific data types might require particular metadata, as a general rule the metadata will be based on a generalized metadata schema such as Dublin Core or DataCite, including the following elements: • Title: free text • Creator: Last name, first name, organization Date and time reference • Subject: Choice of keywords and classifications • Description: Text explaining the content of the data set and other contextual information needed for the correct interpretation of the data, the software(s) (including version number) used to produce and to read the data, the purpose of the experiment, etc. • Format: Details of the file format, • Resource Type: data set, image, audio, etc. Identifier: DOI (when applicable) • Access rights: closed access, embargoed access, restricted access, open access. For specific datasets, additional metadata will be associated with the data file as appropriate. When depositing data in a repository, the final dataset will be accompanied by this information unde r the form of a README.txt document. This file will be located in the top -level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file -naming convention used. This will allow the data to be understood by other memb ers of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse. 5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project Where will the data be stored? - Digital files will be stored on KU Leuven servers (“L-drive”). - Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory and labelled with a reference 6 of 10 number that links them to our Sample Storage Manager (SSM) database . All human tissue samples will be registered with a Belgian biobank, in compliance with the Belgian law on human body material (dd19 -12-2008). - Cell lines: Newly created human pluripotent cell lines will be deposited in the hPSCreg database. Other cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory , in cryotubes labelled with a reference number that links them to our Samp le Storage Manager (SSM) database. - Omics data: omics data generated during the project will either be stored on KU Leuven servers or on The Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC), initially in the staging area and later in the archive area. -Genetically modified organisms: Mice will be maintained in facilities of the Laboratory Animal Center of KU Leuven, which applies Standard Operation Procedures concerning housing, feeding, health monitoring to assure consistent care in accordance with European and national regulations and guidelines. All animals will be registered in the Leuven Animal Information System (LAIS) database, along with corresponding genotyping information, ethical approval documents and animal provider receipts. - Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C, and/or as frozen samples in cryovials at -20°C and -80°C as appropriate. - Algorithms, scripts and softwares: All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software code driving the project will be stored in a private online git repository from the GitHub account of the department (https://github.com/vibcbd). - Nucleic acid and protein sequences: All nucleic acid and protein sequences generated during the project will be stored on KU Leuven servers. Upon publication, all sequences supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via repositories such as the GenBank database or the European Nucleotide Archive (nucleotide sequences from primers / new genes / new genomes), NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (microarray data / RNA-seq data / CHIPseq data), the Protein Database (for protein sequences), the EBI European Genome - phenome Archive (EGA) for personally identifiable (epi)genome and transcriptome sequences. How is backup of the data provided? KU Leuven drives are backed -up according to the following scheme: • Data stored on the “L -drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 bac kups are kept. • Data stored on the “J -drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept. • Data stored on the digital vault is backed up using snapshot te chnology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. As standard, 10% of the requested storage is reserved for backups using the following backup regime: an hourly backup (at 8 a.m., 12 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.), the l ast 6 of which are kept; a daily backup (every day) at midnight, the last 6 of which are kept; and a weekly backup (every week) at midnight between Saturday and Sunday, the last 2 of which are kept. 7 of 10 • All omics data stored on the Flemish Supercomputer Centr e (VSC) will be transferred on a weekly basis to the archive area which is backed up. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will be taken care of. • Yes All data will be stored at servers managed by KU Leuven where storage space can be increased if necessary. What are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these costs be covered? • The total estimated cost of data storage during the project is about 4000€ (for a final volume of 5 TB). This estimation is based on the following costs: • The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 173,78€/TB/Year for the “L - drive” and 519€/TB/Year for the “J -drive”. • Maintaining a mouse colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), excluding the costs of genotyping. When no experiment is planned with a particular mouse strain, and in compliance with the 3R’s rule (https://www.nc3rs.org .uk), cryopreservation will thus be used to safeguard the strain, prevent genetic drift, loss of transgene and potential infections or breeding problems. Cryopreservation of sperm/embryos costs about 500 to 700 euro per genotype, plus a minimal annual stor age fee (25 euro per strain for 250 to 500 embryos). Frozen specimen are kept in two separate liquid nitrogen tanks at two different sites on campus. When necessary, the costs of revitalization from cryopreserved sperm/embryos are about 1,100/600 euro. • Electricity costs for the -80° freezers present in the labs are included in general lab costs. • Data storage and backup costs are included in general lab cost Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Both the “L -drive” and “J -drive” servers are accessible only by laboratory members and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. Access to the digital vault is possible only through using a KU Leuven user -id and password, and user rights only grant access to the data in their own vault. Sensitive data transfer will be performed according to the best practices for “Copying data to the secure environment” defined by KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of upgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound by the ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. A security service monitors the technical 8 of 10 installations continuously, even outside working hours.All private data will be rendered anonymous before processing outside the digital vault. Only the PI will be granted access to the server to deposit private data. The PI will be the only responsible for linking patient information, survey data and/or tissue samples, and will strictly respect confidentiality. All de -identified data will be exported from the database by the PI, and stored on KU Leuven servers from where it can be accessed by the research and technical staff from the laboratory. 6. Data preservation after the FWO project Which data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...). The minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets. All datasets will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic back -up procedures for at least 5 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. Where will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)? As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org ), at the latest at the time of publication. For all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows: • Digital datasets: files will be stored on the “L -drive”. • Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory. • Omics data: datasets will be stored on the “L -drive” or, for larger datasets, on the Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum. • Cell lines: cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory ( -80°C). • Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of p urified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock ( -80°C). • Genetically modified organisms: All other lines that are no actively used for experiments will be cryopreserved. • Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered? The total estimated cost of data storage during the project is about 4000€ (for a final volume of 9 of 10 5 TB). This estimation is based on the following costs: • The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 173,78€/TB/Year for the “L -drive” and 519€/TB/Year for the “J -drive”. • Maintaining a mouse colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), excluding the costs of genotyping. When no experiment is planned with a particular mouse strain, and in compliance with the 3R’s rule (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk), cryopreservation will thus be used to safeguard the strain, prevent genetic drift, loss of transgene and potential infections or breeding problems. Cryopreservation of sperm/embryos costs about 500 to 700 euro per genotype, plus a minimal annual storage fee (25 euro per strain for 250 to 500 embryos). Frozen specimen are kept in two separate liquid nitrogen tanks at two different sites on campus. When necessary, the costs of revitalization from cryop reserved sperm/embryos are about 1,100/600 euro. 10 of 10 7. Data sharing and reuse Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? • No Which data will be made available after the end of the project? Participants to the present project are committed to publish research results to communicate them to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made openly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new collaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. negative data). Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? • In an Open Access repository • Upon request by mail • Other (specify): Open -access publications in peer -reviewed journals, including supplemental informationAs a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing ( www.fairsharing.org). Sharing policies for specific research outputs are detailed below: • Omics datasets will be deposited in open access repositories such as the PRIDE Archive for proteomi cs data, the EMBL -EBI platform for genomics and epigenomics data, or the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) or the EBI ArrayExpress databases for functional genomics data. • Vectors: Upon publication, all vectors supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via the non -profit plasmid repository Addgene, along with the corresponding DNA sequences. Addgene in turn, performs quality control on the DNA, curates the plasmids online with all relevant information (maps, sequences), and for a minim al cost (typically $65) ships the vectors upon simple request and signature of a material transfer agreement. The MTA will be prepared before depositing the vectors with the help of our organization’s Tech Transfer office. For transfer between nonprofit or academic institutions, Addgene typically uses the Uniform Biological Material Transfer Agreement (https://www.addgene.org/terms/1047/). All non -published vectors and the associated documentation will be shared by the PI upon request and after signature of a material transfer agreement, at no cost except the cost of shipment. • Cell lines: All human pluripotent cell lines supporting publications will be 10 of 10 registered in hPSCreg, the European human embryonic stem cell registry supported by the European Commission (https://hpscreg.eu/). Information about the deposited lines (including donor information, derivation method, availability and characterization) will also be made accessible. Registration of cell lines in hPSCreg will provide visibility, confirm ethical p rocurement and facilitate comparison with other hPSC lines. The PI will remain the distributor of the pluripotent cell lines. All other cell lines supporting publications will be deposited in the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) database (https://ww w.atcc.org/), which is a private, non -profit biological resource center. This will provide a secure back -up for this material. Investigators can purchase cell lines from the ATCC database upon signature of a material transfer agreement (https://www.lgcstan dards -atcc.org/~/media/PDFs/MTA_2.ashx) and, in some cases, of a Limited Use/Label License (e.g. for CRISPR products or iPSC materials) and/or a Customer Acceptance of Responsibility (for potentially highly pathogenic materials). Information about the cell lines (including organism, cell type, tissue, biosafety level and disease if applicable) will also be made accessible. • Genetically modified organisms: All genetically modified organisms used in publications will be made available to researchers upon reque st at the time of publication. • Other digital datasets that support publications (including image, video or audio files, electrophysiology data, cytometry data, spectroscopy data and simulation data) will be made publicly available via an open research data platform such as Mendeley Data or Zenodo. • Synthetic and recombinant compounds: samples will be stored as appropriate in the laboratory. Within availability, they will be shared with interested researchers upon request. • Research documentation: All protocol s used to generate published data will be described in the corresponding manuscript(s), and the related documentation will be included as supplementary information. These data and all other documents (daily logs, raw data) deposited in the E -Notebook are a ccessible to the PI and the research staff, and will be made available upon request. • Manuscripts: All scientific publications will be shared openly. Manuscripts submitted for publication will be deposited in a pre -print server such as bioRxiv, arXiv, Natur e Precedings or ASAPbio. At the time of publication, research results will be summarized on the PI’s website and post -print pdf versions of publications will be made available there if allowed by copyright agreements, possibly after an embargo as determine d by the publisher. Before the end of the embargo or in cases where sharing the post -print is not allowed due to copyright agreements, a pre-print version of the manuscript will be made available. Publications will also be automatically added to our instit utional repository, Lirias 2.0, based on the authors name and ORCID ID. • Algorithms, scripts and software: All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software code driving the project will be stored in a private online git repository from the GitHub account o f the department (https://github.com/vibcbd). As soon as the 10 of 10 manuscript is publicly available, the repository will be changed to a public repository. • Nucleic acid and protein sequences: All nucleic acid and protein sequences generated during the project wi ll be stored on KU Leuven servers. Upon publication, all sequences supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via repositories such as the GenBank database or the European Nucleotide Archive (nucleotide sequences from primers / new genes / new genomes), NCBI Gene Expression • Omnibus (microarray data / RNA -seq data / CHIPseq data), the Protein Database (for protein sequences). • Protein structures: Upon publication, all structures supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available as supportin g information and via the Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe) database. Coordinate sets produced by X -ray crystallography / NMR / electron microscopy / neutron diffraction / powder diffraction / fiber diffraction will be deposited to the PDBe together with the corresponding metadata (project acronym, author contact information, context and method of data collection, information about the sequence, chemistry, etc.). Datasets will be cited using the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) link generated by the PDBe, a nd will also be accessible via the elaborate search function available via PDBe.Data that do not support publication will be either deposited in an open access repository or made available upon request by email When will the data be made available? • Upon publication of the research results As a general rule, all research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at the time of publication. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, potential IP requirements – note that patent application filing will be planned so that publications need not be delayed - or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be made publicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse, and will be conform to community norms. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication, a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) or an ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted. 10 of 10 What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered? It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. A budget for publication costs has been requested in this project . 8. Responsibilities Who will be responsible for data documentation & metadata? Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) that refer to specific datasets. Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project? The research and technical staff will ensure data storage and back up, with support from Raf De Coster for the KU Leuven drives and from René Custers and Alexander Botzki for the electronic lab notebook (ELN) . Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and reuse ? The PI is responsible for data preservation and sharing, with support from the research and technical staff involved in the project, from Raf De Coster for the KU Leuven drives and from René Custers and Alexander Botzki for the electronic lab notebook (ELN) . Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP? The PI is ultimately responsible for all data management during and after data collection, including implementing and updating the DMP."
