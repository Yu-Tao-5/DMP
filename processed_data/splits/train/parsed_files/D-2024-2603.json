In the case of acute\nischemic stroke, Mechanical Thrombectomy (MT) has become the first line of treatment. During these interventions, flexible instruments are\nmanoeuvred across stiff obstacles in order to remove a blood clot from an occluded vessel and restore blood supply to the brain. Interventionists\ntypically rely on 2D X-ray fluoroscopy for intra-operative visual guidance, which besides causing numerous health concerns due to prolonged radiation\nexposure, it also limits scene awareness as interventionists must mentally relate 2D information to a 3D representation of the blood vessels while\nperforming safety-critical interventions. Through the development of a series of key enabling technologies, KU Leuven’s Robot Assisted Surgery\n(RAS) group has developed a radiation-free guidance system for safer and improved catheter navigation. By solely relying on intra-operative sensing,\nthe system facilitates 3D local visualization of inherent 3D structures (guidewires/catheters and surrounding vascular network). However, information\nis only provided for a short planning horizon and having a further understanding of the patient’s anatomy might prove useful when trying to detect\nocclusions. As such, LumiSense aims to develop a multimodal visual guidance framework that exploits both radiation-free pre-operative and intra-\noperative imaging. In addition to benefits for patients, the technology creates a safer and more female-friendly work environment.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n30-05-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
