How the built work environment affe cts \nautistic employees is rarely considered, and is the focus of this project. By adopting a mixed -methods approach, it will \noffer insights into (1) differences and similarities in how autistic and comparison employees experience the built work \nenvironment , (2) how different spatial aspects (e.g., indoor environment and its sensory qualities, spatial layout, \nlocation) support or hinder autistic employees’ work activities and social interactions, and (3) how they deal with \nenvironmental (dis)comfort and (un) supportive spatial aspects. Project results will be particularly valuable for \norganisations and architects/designers, while contributing methodologically to future research on autism and \nworkplace design.  \n \nLast modified: 29-03-2024  \n \n \n \n  \nMAKING ROOM FOR AUTISM AT WORK  \nRESEARCH DATA SUMMARY  \n \nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your \nresearch project. For each dataset or data type (observational, experimental etc.), provide a short name & \ndescription (sufficient for yourself to know what data it is about), indicate whether the data are newly \ngenerated/collected or reused, digital or physical, also indicate the type of the data (the kind of content), its \ntechnical format (file  extension), and an estimate of the upper limit of the volume of the data.  \n \nDesigning workplaces with autistic people’s experiences in mind requires gaining insights from two angles: from the \nperson perspective (i.e., ‘bottom -up’ understanding through insi ghts into how autistic people experience, use, and \nadapt their work environment) and from the building design perspective (i.e., ‘top -down’ understanding of how the \ndesign of the built work environment affects their work experiences). Thus in this research  project,  we adopt a two -\ntrack research strategy to gain insights into autistic individual -workplace alignment:  \n● Autistic people track  (Research Track 1 , different individuals, different work environments), which \ninvestigates how different spatial aspects i n the built work environment (e.g., interior design, spatial layout, \nlocation) support or hinder autistic people in their everyday work activities and interactions.  \n● Built work environment track  (Research Track 2 , different individuals, same work environmen t), which \ninvestigates differences and similarities in how autistic people and their co -workers experience the IEQ \nwithin a specific work environment.  \nThe below datasets are structured following this two -track research design.  \nDataset name / ID  Descriptio n New or \nreuse  Digital or \nPhysical data  Data Type  File \nform\nat Data \nvolume  Physical \nvolume  \n    Indicat\ne: \nN(ew \ndata) \nor \nE(xistin\ng data)   \n \n \n \n Indicate:   D(igit\nal) or \nP(hysical)  Indicate:  \nAudiovisual  \nImages  \nSound  \nNumerical \nTextual  \nModel \nSOftware  \nOther \n(specify)    Indicat\ne: \n \n<1GB  \n<100G\nB \n<1TB  \n<5TB  \n>5TB  \nNA   \nWP2.

If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the relevant \nethical approval number.  \n● Yes, human subject data (Provide SMEC or EC approva l number below)  \nWe have received approval for GDPR and ethical compliance from the KU Leuven Social and Societal Ethics \nCommittee (SMEC) for Research Track 1 (Autistic people track) —G-2023 -7542 -R2(MIN). The application for \nResearch Track 2 (Built work environment track)  has been submitted —G-2024 -7716. We envisage the same data \nprotection measures for research data within Research Track 1 to be implemented for Research Track 2.   \n \nThe research project ‘Making room for autism at work’ involves  participation of different participant groups as human \ndata subjects (more details in the subsequent question). Autistic participants in particular are considered as \nvulnerable data subjects due to the sensitive issues of (non)disclosure of autism conditi on in their workplace. To \nensure participants’ privacy and disclosure status in line with their preferences, the project’s data collection methods \nand procedure for processing and storing participants’ data have been carefully considered. Furthermore, pote ntial \nrisks and mitigation strategies will be regularly monitored and adjusted throughout the project.  \nSpecifically:  \n● All participants receive an information letter and an informed consent form. These documents provide more \ndetails about the research (aims) , what participation entails (e.g., methods, expected duration), what data is \ncollected and how it is processed and protected. They also explicitly state that participation is voluntary, and \nparticipants can refuse or withdraw at any time without consequen ces. If signed on paper: the original \ndocuments will be kept under lock in the researcher(s) office. If signed digitally: they will be stored on one of \nthe KU Leuven password protected servers. All documents signed on paper will be digitalized and equally \nstored on the KU Leuven server.  \n● All personal data will be protected with a pseudonymization method, where participant identification \ninformation will be replaced with a code in all relevant research datasets; original documents will be deleted. \nThis applie s in all cases in Research Track 2. In Research Track 1, the participants are also offered the \noption to remain identifiable, if preferred. They are informed of all related risks of this option as well as that \nthey can express their desire to switch to pse udonymous status at any moment. The secure storage \nprocedure applies equally in both Research Track 1 and 2, and independently of the chosen \n(de)identification option.  \nThese aspects refer to datasets:  \n● WP2. Identification and selection of participants and w orkplaces (Research Track 1&2)  \n● WP3.1 Research track 1 (Autistic people track) data collection  \n● WP3.2 Research Track 2 (Built work environment track) data collection  \n● WP4.1 Research track 1 (Autistic people track) data analysis  \n● WP4.2 Research Track 2 (Built w ork environment track) data analysis  \n● WP5. Quality assurance  \n \nIn cases when the participants (co -)create visual and/or textual material as part of the data collection methods within \nResearch Track 1 and 2, we envisage that to use these materials, permission will be sought from their author(s), on \nthe basis of authors hip and/or intellectual property rights.   \nThis relates to the datasets:  \n● Within WP3.1 Research track 1 (Autistic people track) data collection for datasets preparation interview: \nPhotovoice, Videovoice, Drawings, Poems, Diaries.  \n● Within WP3.2 Research Track 2 (Built work environment track) data collection for datasets Building plans \nand Workplace Photos.   \n  \n \nWill you process personal data? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and \nprovide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy r egister number (G or S number).  \n● Yes (Provide PRET G -number or EC S -number below)  \nThis research project involves collecting, storing, and processing personal data of different groups of research \nparticipants —aligned with the research design of each Research Track.   \n \nWithin Research Track 1 (Autistic people track) , we will process persona l data of the following groups: (1) autistic \nparticipants as primary participants, and as secondary participants (2) their co -workers, (3) their housemates (in case \nof individuals with a home office), (4) their (job) coaches if applicable, (5) their manage rs/employers if applicable, \nand/or (6) HR personnel.  \nThe personal data of the primary participants  (1) that will be processed includes:  \n● Identification data: names, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers  \n● Personal details: age, sex/gender (identity), birth date, nationality  \n● Psychological details (personality, character traits that may help to identify a person)  \n● Leisure activities and interests  \n● Education and training  \n● Lifestyle and habits  \n● Characteristics of individuals’ home  \n● Occupation and professional a ctivities: position, company/organization, characteristics of company (e.g. \nsector, number of employees), work experience  \n● Building plans, drawings/mappings, and photographs of the workplaces and home -offices  \nThe special category data of primary participant s includes:  \n● Data concerning (physical and/or mental) health .  \nThe researcher(s) will collect data about the interaction between a participant and the built work environment \nand their work experiences. Health plays a role, and participants are recruited bas ed on their autism \ndiagnosis, self -identification, or the fact that they are seeking/awaiting a diagnosis of autism. However, the \naim is to better understand how the built (work) environment hampers or supports their work life. Health -\nrelated information ( e.g., on autism condition and mental health such as stress) is expected to result from \ninterviews and other qualitative data collection methods described above. It is essential to note that the \nresearcher(s) will not access and will not ask for any files o r documents that relate to participants' diagnoses \nor mental health.  \n● Data revealing racial or ethnic origin  \n● Data revealing religious or philosophical beliefs  \n● Data related to sexual orientation.  \nThe inclusion of data related to sexual orientation is interesting for autism research due to its high \nprevalence. Intersectionality theory further demonstrates that the experiences encountered by participants \nmay arise not only from their autism diagnosis  but also from factors such as sexual orientation, family \nbackground, race, education, gender, age, and more. While the data related to racial and ethnic origin and \ndata revealing religious or philosophical beliefs will not be the central focus of the rese arch, these data may \nbe uncovered during interviews and other qualitative data collection methods and in the light of the \nintersectionality theory, could potentially be a relevant aspect to consider in data analysis.  \n \nThe personal data of the secondary part icipants  (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) that will be processed includes:  \n● Identification data: names, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers  \n● Personal details: age, birth date, nationality  \n● Psychological details (personality, character traits that may help to  identify a person)  \n● Occupation and professional activities: position, company/organization, characteristics of company (e.g. \nsector, number of employees), work experience  \n● Building plans, drawings/mappings, and photographs of the workplaces and home -offices  \n \nPrivacy Registry Reference for Research Track 1 (Autistic people track): G -2023 -7542 -R2(MIN) (approved)  \n \nWithin Research Track 2 (Built work environment track) , we will process personal data of the following groups: (1) \nautistic individuals, (2) their co -workers, (3) managers/employers, (4) (job) coaches, and  (5) HR personnel. In this \nTrack 2, primary participants are autistic individuals and their co -workers, whereas managers/employers, (job) \ncoaches and HR personnel are secondary participants.   \n \nThe perso nal data of the primary participants  (1) autistic individuals, (2) their co -workers that will be processed \ninclude:  \n● Identification data: names, email addresses, telephone numbers  \n● Personal details: age, nationality, gender, sex assigned at birth, highest ac hieved education, and details \nconcerning work.  \n● Occupation and professional activities: position, company/organization, characteristics of company (e.g. \nsector, number of employees), work experience  \n● Momentary feelings and experiences shared through experien ce sampling method  \n● Location (within the workplace)  \n● Annotation on building plans, drawings/mappings, and photographs of the workplaces, that researcher will \nbring to the interviews  \n \nThe special category data for primary participants include:  \n● Data concerning (physical and/or mental) health.  \nThe researcher(s) will collect data about the interaction between a participant and the built work environment \nand their work experiences.

If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate.   \n● Yes \nDataset WP6 Dissemination>Information formats includes a collection of personas with scenarios and/or design \nrecommendations that will be developed based on the research data (datasets within WP3, WP4, and WP5). This \ndataset delineates the characteristics of fictional autistic individuals and their in teractions within the built work \nenvironment, along with recommendations to enhance positive experiences for autistic individuals in the workplace. \nThis dataset has the potential for valorization through Scenario -Based Design as well as to inform material to \nfacilitate discussions of inclusive workplaces for autistic people. In this case, the LRD will be contacted to offer \nguidance.         \n \n \nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material \nor Da ta transfer agreements, Research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain in the comment \nsection to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.  \n● No \nAre there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership , to be managed related \nto the data you (re)use? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and which \nrestrictions will be asserted.  \n● Yes \nAll research data (collected and generated) is owned by the researchers involved in the pro ject, with the exception of \nparticipant -made visual and/or text -based material (in Research Track 1) and participant -researcher co -created visual \nmaterial (in Research Track 2). In the case of exception, in the light of authorship and intellectual property  rights, \npermission will be sought from the author(s) to use these visual and/or text -based materials (e.g., for dissemination \nactivities).   \n \nDOCUMENTATION AND METADATA  \n \nClearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep \ndata understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of \ndocumentation levels and types required, procedures u sed, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, \ncodebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded).   \n \nREADME.txt files will be included within each dataset directory to provide an overview of the dataset's contents, \nformat, and any specific instruction s or considerations for use. This will include, among other information, the details \nof the study setting and the informed consent process. The README files will also include contact information for the \nresearchers responsible for the dataset, enabling use rs to seek clarification or assistance if needed. In addition, steps \ntaken to remove direct identifiers in the data will also be described.  \n \n \n \n \n \nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data?    \nIf so, please specify which metad ata standard will be used.  \n \nIf not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.   \n● No \nIn the context of the research group Research[x]Design (co -chaired by the project’s co -PI Ann Heylighen), steps have \nbeen tak en during 2020 and 2021 to build up an inventory with different datasets, attaching keywords and categories \nto each of them. As the present study progresses, as well as in its completion, for the data produced by KU Leuven \nwe will order and categorize the data sets according to how the group has done it. This way data sets will be findable, \naccessible, and reusable.   \nWhere it concerns camera captures, video - or audio -recordings, a readme file will be added outlining the basic \nfeatures of the device (e.g. br and or when it was purchased (if known)) and/or other contextual factors considered \nrelevant. For some recording devices, a metadata file is created automatically. The metadata file will be stored on the \nsame folder as the recording(s). For safety and ethi cal reasons, recordings will not be stored in the device itself, but \non one of KU Leuven's password protected servers (I and/or J Drive).  \n \nDATA STORAGE & BACK -UP DURING THE RESEARCH PROJECT  \n \nWhere will the data be stored?  \n● Shared network drive (J -drive)  \n● Personal network drive (I -drive)  \n \nAll collected data will be kept in a shared folder managed by the ICTS of KU Leuven — J:\\SET-DEP-ARCH -LEU-\nAIDA -Projects -AE0008 \\Autism -at-Work -0030. The folder is accessible only to the involved researchers Jasmien \nKinnaer, Maria Lackovicova, Lan Phuong Nguyen (and other researchers in the future who are granted access by the \nproject (co)PIs) and supervisors prof. Andrea Jelić (project PI), prof. Ann Heylighen (project co -PI), and prof. Dirk \nSaelens. Because the network drive  is password -protected, no one other than the research team has access to the \ndata. Temporary working files of datasets WP4 and WP6 will be kept on a personal I -drive of the researchers, which \nare managed by the ICTS service of KU Leuven. Paper data (such as notes, physical visual and text -based \nmaterials,…) will be stored in the office of the researchers in a locked drawer or cupboard that can only be accessed \nby the researchers.  \n \nHow will the data be backed up?  \n● Standard back -up provided by KU Leuven ICT S for my storage solution  \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project?  \n \nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, explain how this will be taken care of.   \n● Yes \nThe Department of Architecture has a 2 TB storage capacity + 5 TB for archiving available. This capacity can be \nextended, if needed.   \n \nHow will  you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized \npersons?   \n \nAll research data will be stored on encrypted KU Leuven network drives: the project’s J -drive folder and researchers’ \npersonal I -drive storage, which are managed and secured by the ICTS of KU Leuven. Because the network drive is \npassword -protected, no one other than the research team has access to the data.   \nData collected from the research participants will be pseudonymized (unless participant opts to rema in identifiable in \nResearch Track 1). Only the researchers collecting the data and their supervisors will have access to the \npseudocodes files linking the pseudonymized data to identifiable persons. These password -protected files will be \nstored in a separa te folder within the project’s J -drive folder. Paper data (such as notes, physical visual and text -\nbased materials,…) will be stored in the office of the researchers in a locked drawer or cupboard that can only be \naccessed by the researchers.  \n \nWhat are th e expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs \nbe covered?  \n \nWe do not expect extra costs for data storage.

How the built work environment affe cts autistic employees is rarely considered, and is the focus of this project. By adopting a mixed -methods approach, it will offer insights into (1) differences and similarities in how autistic and comparison employees experience the built work environment , (2) how different spatial aspects (e.g., indoor environment and its sensory qualities, spatial layout, location) support or hinder autistic employees’ work activities and social interactions, and (3) how they deal with environmental (dis)comfort and (un) supportive spatial aspects. Project results will be particularly valuable for organisations and architects/designers, while contributing methodologically to future research on autism and workplace design. Last modified: 29-03-2024 MAKING ROOM FOR AUTISM AT WORK RESEARCH DATA SUMMARY List and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project. For each dataset or data type (observational, experimental etc.), provide a short name & description (sufficient for yourself to know what data it is about), indicate whether the data are newly generated/collected or reused, digital or physical, also indicate the type of the data (the kind of content), its technical format (file extension), and an estimate of the upper limit of the volume of the data. Designing workplaces with autistic people’s experiences in mind requires gaining insights from two angles: from the person perspective (i.e., ‘bottom -up’ understanding through insi ghts into how autistic people experience, use, and adapt their work environment) and from the building design perspective (i.e., ‘top -down’ understanding of how the design of the built work environment affects their work experiences). Thus in this research project, we adopt a two - track research strategy to gain insights into autistic individual -workplace alignment: ● Autistic people track (Research Track 1 , different individuals, different work environments), which investigates how different spatial aspects i n the built work environment (e.g., interior design, spatial layout, location) support or hinder autistic people in their everyday work activities and interactions. ● Built work environment track (Research Track 2 , different individuals, same work environmen t), which investigates differences and similarities in how autistic people and their co -workers experience the IEQ within a specific work environment. The below datasets are structured following this two -track research design.

Are there any ethical issues concernin g the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number. ● Yes, human subject data (Provide SMEC or EC approva l number below) We have received approval for GDPR and ethical compliance from the KU Leuven Social and Societal Ethics Committee (SMEC) for Research Track 1 (Autistic people track) —G-2023 -7542 -R2(MIN). The application for Research Track 2 (Built work environment track) has been submitted —G-2024 -7716. We envisage the same data protection measures for research data within Research Track 1 to be implemented for Research Track 2. The research project ‘Making room for autism at work’ involves participation of different participant groups as human data subjects (more details in the subsequent question). Autistic participants in particular are considered as vulnerable data subjects due to the sensitive issues of (non)disclosure of autism conditi on in their workplace. To ensure participants’ privacy and disclosure status in line with their preferences, the project’s data collection methods and procedure for processing and storing participants’ data have been carefully considered. Furthermore, pote ntial risks and mitigation strategies will be regularly monitored and adjusted throughout the project. Specifically: ● All participants receive an information letter and an informed consent form. These documents provide more details about the research (aims) , what participation entails (e.g., methods, expected duration), what data is collected and how it is processed and protected. They also explicitly state that participation is voluntary, and participants can refuse or withdraw at any time without consequen ces. If signed on paper: the original documents will be kept under lock in the researcher(s) office. If signed digitally: they will be stored on one of the KU Leuven password protected servers. All documents signed on paper will be digitalized and equally stored on the KU Leuven server. ● All personal data will be protected with a pseudonymization method, where participant identification information will be replaced with a code in all relevant research datasets; original documents will be deleted. This applie s in all cases in Research Track 2. In Research Track 1, the participants are also offered the option to remain identifiable, if preferred. They are informed of all related risks of this option as well as that they can express their desire to switch to pse udonymous status at any moment. The secure storage procedure applies equally in both Research Track 1 and 2, and independently of the chosen (de)identification option. These aspects refer to datasets: ● WP2. Identification and selection of participants and w orkplaces (Research Track 1&2) ● WP3.1 Research track 1 (Autistic people track) data collection ● WP3.2 Research Track 2 (Built work environment track) data collection ● WP4.1 Research track 1 (Autistic people track) data analysis ● WP4.2 Research Track 2 (Built w ork environment track) data analysis ● WP5. Quality assurance In cases when the participants (co -)create visual and/or textual material as part of the data collection methods within Research Track 1 and 2, we envisage that to use these materials, permission will be sought from their author(s), on the basis of authors hip and/or intellectual property rights. This relates to the datasets: ● Within WP3.1 Research track 1 (Autistic people track) data collection for datasets preparation interview: Photovoice, Videovoice, Drawings, Poems, Diaries. ● Within WP3.2 Research Track 2 (Built work environment track) data collection for datasets Building plans and Workplace Photos. Will you process personal data? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy r egister number (G or S number). ● Yes (Provide PRET G -number or EC S -number below) This research project involves collecting, storing, and processing personal data of different groups of research participants —aligned with the research design of each Research Track. Within Research Track 1 (Autistic people track) , we will process persona l data of the following groups: (1) autistic participants as primary participants, and as secondary participants (2) their co -workers, (3) their housemates (in case of individuals with a home office), (4) their (job) coaches if applicable, (5) their manage rs/employers if applicable, and/or (6) HR personnel. The personal data of the primary participants (1) that will be processed includes: ● Identification data: names, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers ● Personal details: age, sex/gender (identity), birth date, nationality ● Psychological details (personality, character traits that may help to identify a person) ● Leisure activities and interests ● Education and training ● Lifestyle and habits ● Characteristics of individuals’ home ● Occupation and professional a ctivities: position, company/organization, characteristics of company (e.g. sector, number of employees), work experience ● Building plans, drawings/mappings, and photographs of the workplaces and home -offices The special category data of primary participant s includes: ● Data concerning (physical and/or mental) health . The researcher(s) will collect data about the interaction between a participant and the built work environment and their work experiences. Health plays a role, and participants are recruited bas ed on their autism diagnosis, self -identification, or the fact that they are seeking/awaiting a diagnosis of autism. However, the aim is to better understand how the built (work) environment hampers or supports their work life. Health - related information ( e.g., on autism condition and mental health such as stress) is expected to result from interviews and other qualitative data collection methods described above. It is essential to note that the researcher(s) will not access and will not ask for any files o r documents that relate to participants' diagnoses or mental health. ● Data revealing racial or ethnic origin ● Data revealing religious or philosophical beliefs ● Data related to sexual orientation. The inclusion of data related to sexual orientation is interesting for autism research due to its high prevalence. Intersectionality theory further demonstrates that the experiences encountered by participants may arise not only from their autism diagnosis but also from factors such as sexual orientation, family background, race, education, gender, age, and more. While the data related to racial and ethnic origin and data revealing religious or philosophical beliefs will not be the central focus of the rese arch, these data may be uncovered during interviews and other qualitative data collection methods and in the light of the intersectionality theory, could potentially be a relevant aspect to consider in data analysis. The personal data of the secondary part icipants (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) that will be processed includes: ● Identification data: names, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers ● Personal details: age, birth date, nationality ● Psychological details (personality, character traits that may help to identify a person) ● Occupation and professional activities: position, company/organization, characteristics of company (e.g. sector, number of employees), work experience ● Building plans, drawings/mappings, and photographs of the workplaces and home -offices Privacy Registry Reference for Research Track 1 (Autistic people track): G -2023 -7542 -R2(MIN) (approved) Within Research Track 2 (Built work environment track) , we will process personal data of the following groups: (1) autistic individuals, (2) their co -workers, (3) managers/employers, (4) (job) coaches, and (5) HR personnel. In this Track 2, primary participants are autistic individuals and their co -workers, whereas managers/employers, (job) coaches and HR personnel are secondary participants. The perso nal data of the primary participants (1) autistic individuals, (2) their co -workers that will be processed include: ● Identification data: names, email addresses, telephone numbers ● Personal details: age, nationality, gender, sex assigned at birth, highest ac hieved education, and details concerning work. ● Occupation and professional activities: position, company/organization, characteristics of company (e.g. sector, number of employees), work experience ● Momentary feelings and experiences shared through experien ce sampling method ● Location (within the workplace) ● Annotation on building plans, drawings/mappings, and photographs of the workplaces, that researcher will bring to the interviews The special category data for primary participants include: ● Data concerning (physical and/or mental) health. The researcher(s) will collect data about the interaction between a participant and the built work environment and their work experiences. Health plays a role, and participants are recruited based on their autism diagnosis , self -identification, or the fact that they are seeking/awaiting a diagnosis of autism. However, the aim is to better understand how the built (work) environment hampers or supports their work life. Health - related information (e.g., on autism condition an d mental health such as stress) is expected to result from interviews and other qualitative data collection methods described above. It is essential to note that the researcher(s) will not access and will not ask for any files or documents that relate to p articipants' diagnoses or mental health. ● Data revealing racial or ethnic origin, ● Data revealing religious or philosophical beliefs ● Data related to sexual orientation. The inclusion of data related to sexual orientation is interesting for autism research d ue to its high prevalence. Intersectionality theory further demonstrates that the experiences encountered by participants may arise not only from their autism diagnosis but also from factors such as sexual orientation, family background, race, education, g ender, age, and more. While the data related to racial and ethnic origin and data revealing religious or philosophical beliefs will not be the central focus of the research, these data may be uncovered during interviews and other qualitative data collectio n methods and in the light of the intersectionality theory, could potentially be a relevant aspect to consider in data analysis. The personal data of the secondary participants , (3) managers/employers, (4) (job) coaches, and (5) HR personnel, that will be processed my include: ● Identification data: names, email addresses, telephone numbers ● Personal details: age, nationality, gender, sex assigned at birth, work status, and information related to your work experiences. ● Occupation and professional activities: position, company/organization, characteristics of company (e.g. sector, number of emp loyees), work experience ● Annotation on building plans, drawings/mappings, and photographs of the workplaces, that researcher will bring to the interviews Privacy Registry Reference for Research Track 2 (Built work environment track): G -2024 -7716 (submitted ) Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin -offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. ● Yes Dataset WP6 Dissemination>Information formats includes a collection of personas with scenarios and/or design recommendations that will be developed based on the research data (datasets within WP3, WP4, and WP5). This dataset delineates the characteristics of fictional autistic individuals and their in teractions within the built work environment, along with recommendations to enhance positive experiences for autistic individuals in the workplace. This dataset has the potential for valorization through Scenario -Based Design as well as to inform material to facilitate discussions of inclusive workplaces for autistic people. In this case, the LRD will be contacted to offer guidance. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material or Da ta transfer agreements, Research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. ● No Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership , to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. ● Yes All research data (collected and generated) is owned by the researchers involved in the pro ject, with the exception of participant -made visual and/or text -based material (in Research Track 1) and participant -researcher co -created visual material (in Research Track 2). In the case of exception, in the light of authorship and intellectual property rights, permission will be sought from the author(s) to use these visual and/or text -based materials (e.g., for dissemination activities). DOCUMENTATION AND METADATA Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures u sed, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). README.txt files will be included within each dataset directory to provide an overview of the dataset's contents, format, and any specific instruction s or considerations for use. This will include, among other information, the details of the study setting and the informed consent process. The README files will also include contact information for the researchers responsible for the dataset, enabling use rs to seek clarification or assistance if needed. In addition, steps taken to remove direct identifiers in the data will also be described. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify which metad ata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. ● No In the context of the research group Research[x]Design (co -chaired by the project’s co -PI Ann Heylighen), steps have been tak en during 2020 and 2021 to build up an inventory with different datasets, attaching keywords and categories to each of them. As the present study progresses, as well as in its completion, for the data produced by KU Leuven we will order and categorize the data sets according to how the group has done it. This way data sets will be findable, accessible, and reusable. Where it concerns camera captures, video - or audio -recordings, a readme file will be added outlining the basic features of the device (e.g. br and or when it was purchased (if known)) and/or other contextual factors considered relevant. For some recording devices, a metadata file is created automatically. The metadata file will be stored on the same folder as the recording(s). For safety and ethi cal reasons, recordings will not be stored in the device itself, but on one of KU Leuven's password protected servers (I and/or J Drive). DATA STORAGE & BACK -UP DURING THE RESEARCH PROJECT Where will the data be stored? ● Shared network drive (J -drive) ● Personal network drive (I -drive) All collected data will be kept in a shared folder managed by the ICTS of KU Leuven — J:\\SET-DEP-ARCH -LEU- AIDA -Projects -AE0008 \\Autism -at-Work -0030. The folder is accessible only to the involved researchers Jasmien Kinnaer, Maria Lackovicova, Lan Phuong Nguyen (and other researchers in the future who are granted access by the project (co)PIs) and supervisors prof. Andrea Jelić (project PI), prof. Ann Heylighen (project co -PI), and prof. Dirk Saelens. Because the network drive is password -protected, no one other than the research team has access to the data. Temporary working files of datasets WP4 and WP6 will be kept on a personal I -drive of the researchers, which are managed by the ICTS service of KU Leuven. Paper data (such as notes, physical visual and text -based materials,…) will be stored in the office of the researchers in a locked drawer or cupboard that can only be accessed by the researchers. How will the data be backed up? ● Standard back -up provided by KU Leuven ICT S for my storage solution Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, explain how this will be taken care of. ● Yes The Department of Architecture has a 2 TB storage capacity + 5 TB for archiving available. This capacity can be extended, if needed. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? All research data will be stored on encrypted KU Leuven network drives: the project’s J -drive folder and researchers’ personal I -drive storage, which are managed and secured by the ICTS of KU Leuven. Because the network drive is password -protected, no one other than the research team has access to the data. Data collected from the research participants will be pseudonymized (unless participant opts to rema in identifiable in Research Track 1). Only the researchers collecting the data and their supervisors will have access to the pseudocodes files linking the pseudonymized data to identifiable persons. These password -protected files will be stored in a separa te folder within the project’s J -drive folder. Paper data (such as notes, physical visual and text - based materials,…) will be stored in the office of the researchers in a locked drawer or cupboard that can only be accessed by the researchers. What are th e expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? We do not expect extra costs for data storage. In case we need to extend the storage capacity, costs will be covered by the budget of the project. DATA PRESERVATION AFTER THE END OF THE RESEARCH PROJECT Which data will be retained for 10 years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly s tate the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). ● All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy After 10 years the researchers will decide whether it is necess ary to store the (personal) data for a longer time. If it is necessary to keep the data, a reminder date will be set at which the researchers will again decide whether the data still need to be kept. When further storage is no longer necessary the (persona l) data will be deleted. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? ● Shared network drive (J -drive) ● Other (specify below) As stated before, the Department of Architecture has a 5 TB archiving capacity. This capacity can be extended, if needed. The physical data will be stored in a lockable cabinet in the office of the research team in KU Leuven up for 10 years after the proje ct. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? We do not expect extra costs for data storage. DATA SHARING AND REUSE Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. ● Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) All research data will only be made available for follow -up research within the Research[x]Design group and/or Building Physics and Sustainable Design Section after approval by project (co)PIs prof. Andrea Jelić and prof. Ann Heylighen. If access is restricted, please spe cify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Prof. Andrea Jelić, prof. Ann Heylighen, prof. Dirk Saelens, researchers Jasmien Kinnaer, Maria Lackovicova, Lan Phuong Nguyen, and other researchers and students under the supervision o f prof. Andrea Jelić and/or prof. Ann Heylighen, who, as part of their study curriculum (PhD, master thesis, course activities), conduct research related to this project will access and reuse all datasets after/during the project. The participating researc hers and students will be added as involved KU Leuven researchers and the same ethical considerations agreed upon for the project will apply to collaborating researchers/students, including compliance with the confidentiality rules for the given data. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?
