Classical bilingualism involves the\ncompetence of actively speaking and writing both Classical Latin and Ancient Greek. This project argues that the great age of written classical\nbilingualism should be situated in the so-called Renaissance rather than in antiquity. To this end, it compares Erasmus' classical bilingualism with that\nof Cicero. This comparison requires the creation of a corpus with full-texts of Erasmus' works, including his correspondence. In order to efficiently\nanalyze the linguistic make-up of texts, the project develops the novel 'tongueprint' pipeline. In view of gaining insight into the thematic associations of\nLatin and Greek, topic modeling experiments are conducted. The results of these automated analyses are checked through a textual microanalysis and\nsupplemented with a social network analysis of Erasmus' classical bilingual networks. The project will lead to a new text corpus, innovative digital\ntools, and a wide-ranging synthesis of Erasmus' classical bilingualism. \nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n26-03-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
