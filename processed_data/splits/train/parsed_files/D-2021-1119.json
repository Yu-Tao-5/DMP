Despite the prevalent neuronal cell death in AD, the modality of cell\ndeath and molecular events leading to such neuronal cell death mechanisms are seldom\ninvestigated. Lack of preclinical models that sufficiently recapitulate AD-relevant neuronal cell\ndeath has impeded progress in this area. We recently demonstrated the activation of the\nnecroptosis pathway in post-mortem AD brains. Necroptosis markers are highly enriched inside\nAD lesions, correlated with TAU pathology, and inversely correlated neuronal cell density in the\nhippocampus & frontal cortex (Koper et al., 2019). However, the contribution of necroptosis\ntowards neuronal cell loss and upstream activators of the pathway is unknown. Hence in the\npresent proposal, we take full advantage of an already established iPSC-derived neuronal\nxenograft model, which displays classical hallmarks of AD, including TAU pathology and\nnecroptosis activation. We will interfere with the necroptosis critical molecules of the pathway\nand modulate the neuroinflammation to assess the contribution of necroptosis pathway in\nneuronal loss. Finally, capitalizing on the cell death phenotype, we will perform in vivo full-\ngenome CRISPR-CAS9 screen to identify the modulators of neuronal cells and validate them in\nclinical and preclinical models.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

This file will be located in the top level directory of the dataset\nand will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention\nused. This will allow the data to be understood by other\nmembers of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nAll other electronic files (text documents, images, sequences, facs files): will be stored on KU\nLeuven servers (L-drrive), with hourly on-site backup and mirroring or stored on a cloud-based\nservice offered by KU Leuven (OneDrive). In addition, data will be regularly backed -up\nand stored on an external hard drive.\nAll samples will be stored as appropriate: -80°C for nucleic acids, protein samples,\nwill be stored with appropriate backup copies of the stock in the Prof. De Stroopers lab at KU\nLeuven. Vectors: As a general rule at least two\nindependently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form\nof purified DNA (in -20°C freezer). One copy will be submitted to the lab plasmid databse system.\nAll published vectors and the associated\nsequences will be sent to the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will take\ncare of vector storage and shipping upon request. Other biological and chemical\nsamples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nData will be stored on OneDrive, which is synced approximately every 10 minutes.\nBackup to external hard drives will be performed once a month. KU Leuven servers\nhave hourly on-site backup and mirroring.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nOnedrive provides 1TB of storage data which should be sufficient for the data generated in the\nproject.\nKU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme:\n- data stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all\nincremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are\nkept.\n- data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at\nmidnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept.\n- All omics data stored on the Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC) will be transferred on a\nweekly basis to the archive area which is backed up.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n5 of 8\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nThe costs of the storage of 1-2 TB data for 5 years on KU Leuven servers are\nmaximally €1737.80. \nThese costs will be met partially by the benchfee provided by the FWO and partially by\nexisting lab grants.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nBoth the “L-drive” and “J-drive” servers are accessible only by laboratory members and are\nmirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a\ncopy of the data can be recovered within an hour.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nThe minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all\ndatasets.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nAs a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing\nplatforms that support FAIR data sharing (\nwww.fairsharing.org\n), at the latest at the time of\npublication.\nFor all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows:\nDigital datasets: files will be stored on the “L-drive”.\nTissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory.\nOmics data: datasets will be stored on the “L-drive” or, for larger datasets, on the Vlaams\nSupercomputer Centrum.\nVectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for\neach vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria\nglycerol stock (-80°C).\nCell lines: cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory (-80°C).\nGenetically modified organisms: lines that are no actively used for experiments will be\ncryopreserved.\nOther biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials\nas appropriate.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nThe total estimated cost of data storage during the 5 years after the end of the project is about\n4500€ (for 5 TB). This estimation is based on the different costs described before.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nNo\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nParticipants to the present project are committed to publish research results to communicate\nthem to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made\nopenly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to\npublication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new\ncollaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. negative data).\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn an Open Access repository\nUpon request by mail\nAs a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible via existing platforms that support\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n6 of 8\nFAIR data sharing (\nwww.fairsharing.org\n). Sharing policies for specific research outputs are\ndetailed below:\nOmics datasets will be deposited in open access repositories such as the PRIDE Archive for\nproteomics data, the EMBL-EBI platform for genomics and epigenomics data, the LIPID MAPS\nLipidomics Gateway for lipidomics data, the Metabolomics Workbench Data Repository for\nmetabolomics data, or the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) or the EBI ArrayExpress\ndatabases for functional genomics data.\nVectors: Upon publication, all vectors supporting a manuscript will be made publicly\navailable via the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, along with the corresponding DNA\nsequences. Addgene in turns performs quality control on the DNA, curates the plasmids\nonline with all relevant information (maps, sequences), and for a minimal cost (typically\n$65) ships the vectors upon simple request and signature of a material transfer agreement.\nThe MTA will be prepared before depositing the vectors with the help of our organization’s\nTech Transfer office. For transfer between nonprofit or academic institutions, Addgene\ntypically uses the Uniform Biological Material Transfer Agreement\n(https://www.addgene.org/terms/1047/). All non-published vectors and the associated\ndocumentation will be shared by the PI upon request and after signature of a material\ntransfer agreement, at no cost except the cost of shipment.\nCell lines: All human pluripotent cell lines supporting publications will be registered in\nhPSCreg, the European human embryonic stem cell registry supported by the European\nCommission (https://hpscreg.eu/). Information about the deposited lines (including donor\ninformation, derivation method, availability and characterization) will also be made\naccessible. Registration of cell lines in hPSCreg will provide visibility, confirm ethical\nprocurement and facilitate comparison with other hPSC lines. The PI will remain the\ndistributor of the pluripotent cell lines.\nAll other cell lines supporting publications will be deposited in the American Type Culture\nCollection (ATCC) database (https://www.atcc.org/), which is a private, non-profit biological\nresource center. This will provide a secure back-up for this material. Investigators can purchase\ncell lines from the ATCC database upon signature of a material transfer agreement\n(https://www.lgcstandards-atcc.org/~/media/PDFs/MTA_2.ashx) and, in some cases, of a Limited\nUse/Label License (e.g. for CRISPR products or iPSC materials) and/or a Customer Acceptance of\nResponsibility (for potentially highly pathogenic materials). Information about the cell lines\n(including organism, cell type, tissue, biosafety level and disease if applicable) will also be made\naccessible.\nGenetically modified organisms: All genetically modified organisms used in publications will\nbe made available to researchers upon request at the time of publication.\nAntibodies, synthetic and recombinant compounds: samples will be stored as appropriate in\nthe laboratory. Within availability, they will be shared with interested researchers upon\nrequest.\nResearch documentation: All protocols used to generate published data will be described in\nthe corresponding manuscript(s), and the related documentation will be included as\nsupplementary information. These data and all other documents (daily logs, raw data)\ndeposited in the E-Notebook are accessible to the PI and the research staff, and will be\nmade available upon request.\nManuscripts: All scientific publications will be shared openly. Manuscripts submitted for\npublication will be deposited in a pre-print server such as bioRxiv, arXiv, Nature Precedings\nor ASAPbio). At the time of publication, research results will be summarized on the PI’s\nwebsite (add website address) and post-print pdf versions of publications will be made\navailable there if allowed by copyright agreements, possibly after an embargo as\ndetermined by the publisher. Before the end of the embargo or in cases where sharing the\npost-print is not allowed due to copyright agreements, a pre-print version of the manuscript\nwill be made available. Publications will also be automatically added to our institutional\nrepository, Lirias 2.0, based on the authors name and ORCID ID.\nNucleic acid and protein sequences: All nucleic acid and protein sequences generated\nduring the project will be stored on KU Leuven servers. Upon publication, all sequences\nsupporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via repositories such as the\nGenBank database or the European Nucleotide Archive (nucleotide sequences from primers\n/ new genes / new genomes), NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (microarray data / RNA-seq\ndata / CHIPseq data), the Protein Database (for protein sequences).\nData that do not support publication will be either deposited in an open access repository or\nmade available upon request by email.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n7 of 8\nWhen will the data be made available?\nImmediately after the end of the project\nAfter an embargo period. Specify the length of the embargo and why this is necessary\nUpon publication of the research results\nAll research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at the time of publication. No\nembargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, potential IP requirements\n– note that patent application filing will be planned so that publications need not be delayed - or\nongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be made publicly\navailable as soon as the embargo date is reached.\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nWhenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available\nthrough repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain\nsufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse and will be conform to community\nnorms. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative\nCommons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication or an ODC Public Domain\nDedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties\nwill thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the\ndata used by citing the corresponding DOI. For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer\nagreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the\nbeneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nIt is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g.\nfor metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by\nusing free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data\nmanagement costs will be covered by the laboratory budget.\n8.

All samples will be stored as appropriate: -80°C for nucleic acids, protein samples, will be stored with appropriate backup copies of the stock in the Prof. De Stroopers lab at KU Leuven. Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer). One copy will be submitted to the lab plasmid databse system. All published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request. Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate. How is backup of the data provided? Data will be stored on OneDrive, which is synced approximately every 10 minutes. Backup to external hard drives will be performed once a month. KU Leuven servers have hourly on-site backup and mirroring. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Onedrive provides 1TB of storage data which should be sufficient for the data generated in the project. KU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme: - data stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept. - data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept. - All omics data stored on the Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC) will be transferred on a weekly basis to the archive area which is backed up.

The costs of the storage of 1-2 TB data for 5 years on KU Leuven servers are maximally €1737.80. These costs will be met partially by the benchfee provided by the FWO and partially by existing lab grants. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Both the “L-drive” and “J-drive” servers are accessible only by laboratory members and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. 6. Data preservation after the FWO project Which data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...). The minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets. Where will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)? As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing ( www.fairsharing.org ), at the latest at the time of publication. For all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows: Digital datasets: files will be stored on the “L-drive”. Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory. Omics data: datasets will be stored on the “L-drive” or, for larger datasets, on the Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum. Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock (-80°C). Cell lines: cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory (-80°C). Genetically modified organisms: lines that are no actively used for experiments will be cryopreserved. Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered? The total estimated cost of data storage during the 5 years after the end of the project is about 4500€ (for 5 TB). This estimation is based on the different costs described before. 7. Data sharing and reuse Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? No Which data will be made available after the end of the project? Participants to the present project are committed to publish research results to communicate them to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made openly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new collaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. negative data). Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? In an Open Access repository Upon request by mail As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible via existing platforms that support This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 6 of 8 FAIR data sharing ( www.fairsharing.org ). Sharing policies for specific research outputs are detailed below: Omics datasets will be deposited in open access repositories such as the PRIDE Archive for proteomics data, the EMBL-EBI platform for genomics and epigenomics data, the LIPID MAPS Lipidomics Gateway for lipidomics data, the Metabolomics Workbench Data Repository for metabolomics data, or the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) or the EBI ArrayExpress databases for functional genomics data. Vectors: Upon publication, all vectors supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, along with the corresponding DNA sequences. Addgene in turns performs quality control on the DNA, curates the plasmids online with all relevant information (maps, sequences), and for a minimal cost (typically $65) ships the vectors upon simple request and signature of a material transfer agreement. The MTA will be prepared before depositing the vectors with the help of our organization’s Tech Transfer office. For transfer between nonprofit or academic institutions, Addgene typically uses the Uniform Biological Material Transfer Agreement (https://www.addgene.org/terms/1047/). All non-published vectors and the associated documentation will be shared by the PI upon request and after signature of a material transfer agreement, at no cost except the cost of shipment. Cell lines: All human pluripotent cell lines supporting publications will be registered in hPSCreg, the European human embryonic stem cell registry supported by the European Commission (https://hpscreg.eu/). Information about the deposited lines (including donor information, derivation method, availability and characterization) will also be made accessible. Registration of cell lines in hPSCreg will provide visibility, confirm ethical procurement and facilitate comparison with other hPSC lines. The PI will remain the distributor of the pluripotent cell lines. All other cell lines supporting publications will be deposited in the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) database (https://www.atcc.org/), which is a private, non-profit biological resource center. This will provide a secure back-up for this material. Investigators can purchase cell lines from the ATCC database upon signature of a material transfer agreement (https://www.lgcstandards-atcc.org/~/media/PDFs/MTA_2.ashx) and, in some cases, of a Limited Use/Label License (e.g. for CRISPR products or iPSC materials) and/or a Customer Acceptance of Responsibility (for potentially highly pathogenic materials). Information about the cell lines (including organism, cell type, tissue, biosafety level and disease if applicable) will also be made accessible. Genetically modified organisms: All genetically modified organisms used in publications will be made available to researchers upon request at the time of publication. Antibodies, synthetic and recombinant compounds: samples will be stored as appropriate in the laboratory. Within availability, they will be shared with interested researchers upon request. Research documentation: All protocols used to generate published data will be described in the corresponding manuscript(s), and the related documentation will be included as supplementary information. These data and all other documents (daily logs, raw data) deposited in the E-Notebook are accessible to the PI and the research staff, and will be made available upon request. Manuscripts: All scientific publications will be shared openly. Manuscripts submitted for publication will be deposited in a pre-print server such as bioRxiv, arXiv, Nature Precedings or ASAPbio). At the time of publication, research results will be summarized on the PI’s website (add website address) and post-print pdf versions of publications will be made available there if allowed by copyright agreements, possibly after an embargo as determined by the publisher. Before the end of the embargo or in cases where sharing the post-print is not allowed due to copyright agreements, a pre-print version of the manuscript will be made available. Publications will also be automatically added to our institutional repository, Lirias 2.0, based on the authors name and ORCID ID. Nucleic acid and protein sequences: All nucleic acid and protein sequences generated during the project will be stored on KU Leuven servers. Upon publication, all sequences supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via repositories such as the GenBank database or the European Nucleotide Archive (nucleotide sequences from primers / new genes / new genomes), NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (microarray data / RNA-seq data / CHIPseq data), the Protein Database (for protein sequences). Data that do not support publication will be either deposited in an open access repository or made available upon request by email. This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 7 of 8 When will the data be made available? Immediately after the end of the project After an embargo period. Specify the length of the embargo and why this is necessary Upon publication of the research results All research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at the time of publication. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, potential IP requirements – note that patent application filing will be planned so that publications need not be delayed - or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be made publicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse and will be conform to community norms. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication or an ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered? It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. 8. Responsibilities Who will be responsible for data documentation & metadata?
