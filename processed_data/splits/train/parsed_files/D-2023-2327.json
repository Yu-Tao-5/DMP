Yet,\nthey contribute to discourse coherence, express speakers’ attitudes, index various types of relations, and help interactants to build rapport. Examples in\nEnglish are \nso\n, \nwell\n,\n you know\n, \nI mean\n and \nlike\n. Research on pragmatic markers has surged over the past thirty years, although much of the field has\nbeen rather anglocentric. In recent years the research scope has been broadened to also include non-native discourse. Because pragmatic markers are\nrarely taught explicitly in foreign language classes, language learners have been shown to use them to widely varying degrees. It has proved hard to\nexplain in any reliable way why specific markers are used extensively by some learners and others are hardly used at all. The most obvious explanation\nfor learner behaviour is always how learners use similar items in their mother tongue. Researchers are, however, faced with the obstacle that in most\ncases no similar data are available for these languages, making such explanations highly tentative. \nThis project will, therefore, monitor how native speakers of Dutch who are learners of English use pragmatic markers in English and how this\ncompares (i) to native English speech, and (ii) to these learners’ use of pragmatic markers in their mother tongue (Dutch). For this we will study\nrecordings of 45 dyad conversations between familiars. These conversations will be equally distributed across learners of English in English, these\nsame learners but in their mother tongue (Dutch), and native speakers of English. The native English conversations are already available from a\nprevious C1 project, whereas the others will be collected within the proposed project. The data will be analysed both quantitatively (e.g. comparing\nfrequencies between speakers/speaker groups) and qualitatively (e.g. functional analyses of pragmatic marker use).\nApart from shedding light on the influence of transfer from learners’ mother tongue in how they use pragmatic markers in their target language, the\nproject will make three further major contributions to the research field. First, the approach adopted in the study will allow for a uniquely combined\nperspective yielding insight into speakers’ individual pragmatic preferences as well as into how these contribute to tendencies at group level, which\ndiverts from the typical tendency to consider learners as a homogeneous group. Second, contrary to most other studies of learner language, this\ninvestigation will be able to rely on data from peer-to-peer interaction, since pragmatics is best observed in settings that are not artificially constrained.\nThird, our knowledge of pragmatic markers in Dutch will be greatly expanded through an unprecedented corpus-based analysis of peer-to-peer\ninteraction, which will also act as a catalyst for further studies in this field on Dutch.\nIn short, the project will empirically show the nature of mother tongue impact on learner pragmatics, lay bare contrasts between English and Dutch in\npragmatic marker usage, and will enable educators to rethink pedagogical strategies to the acquisition of pragmatics.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n26-03-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
