This distinct disease entity is characterized by a rapid\ndeterioration of liver function, the development of organ failure and an extremely high short-term mortality. Currently, no therapy exists and ACLF is\nmanaged by organ support and treatment of the precipitating event. Important to note is that patients with ACLF exhibit an immunological paradox\nwhereby they feature a hyperinflammatory state on the one hand and a co-existing phase of immunoparesis and infection susceptibility, on the other\nhand. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that tips the balance towards dampening inappropriate systemic inflammation and reinstating effective\nantibacterial function, would be crucial to extend patient survival. Here we aim to compose a comprehensive transcriptional map of hepatic (immune)\ncells and their microanatomical location that underlie ACLF immune dysfunction. We further aim to validate- the identified targets in independent\npatient cohorts or in murine models mimicking the ACLF syndrome. A success in this project will have groundbreaking impact on shedding light on\nthe pathogenesis of ACLF.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n27-06-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Researchers involved in the project can control who they give access to the files on their personal OneDrive. To access the KU Leuven servers, access is provided and controlled by the research manager, Hannelie Korf. The KU Leuven ICTS data center hosts the network storage, with a mirror available in the second ICTS center. This ensures additional back-up capacity, recovery of lost data and long term data availability. The access is controlled by KU Leuven security groups and it is password protected. Data related to Patients and controls are pseudonymized, which is managed by the research manager, Hannelie Korf. The list linking the anonymized code with patient records (name, EMDNR number, clinical data) is stored on the hepatology common J-drive, and is locked under password protection. Password access if provided for read-only access to the students and technicians who are working directly with the samples. Hannelie Korf retains the sole ability to modify this file under alternative password protection. All samples are processed and stored as per their anonymized code only.
