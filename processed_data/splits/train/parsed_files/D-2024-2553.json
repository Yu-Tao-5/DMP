A\nsignificant potential to obtain clean energy exists from mixing water streams with different salt concentrations also called as blue-energy. The\nglobal potential, including the more efficient combinations with very high salinity streams as e.g. from salt mines or brines, is estimated at 2.6 TW,\nrepresenting approximately 20% of the present worldwide energy demand. To harness this osmotic power, pressure retarded osmosis (PRO)\ntechnology holds great potential but still faces critical challenges, such as the absence of specifically tailored PRO membranes, availability of suitable\ndraw solutes and their regeneration, and power loss due to fouling. Therefore, this project focuses on bringing high pressure PRO as a competitive\nenergy technology by substantially improving three bottle-neck concerns of osmotic processes i.e. membranes, draw solutes, and application. Patterned\nmembranes with high fluxes, porosities and mechanical strength will be prepared by modified phase inversion and non-solvent spraying. Cost\neffective draw solutes will be developed that are easily synthesized and regenerated, have minimal reverse diffusion and generate high osmotic\npressures. Lastly, unique and specific applications will be evaluated experimentally and economically for their real-world implementation.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n26-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The lab notes and work laptop are stored in a locked cupboard in the researcher's office. The office is located in a badge-restricted area of the building, and is locked if no one is inside. The laptop is secured with a password and access to double authentication is required to access the KUL One Drive system from other devices. No very sensitive data will be generated, therefore no extra security (encryption of the computer) is foreseen at this stage.
