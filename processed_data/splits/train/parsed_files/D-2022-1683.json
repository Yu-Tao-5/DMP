This antibody gene transfer can allow the body to produce its own genetic medicine, and  \npresents an alternative to the complex production and frequent administration of conventional antibody  \nprotein therapy. We previously obtained therapeutic proof-of-concept in mice and several plasmid-encoded  \nantibody formats, and demonstrated clinical feasibility in sheep and non-human primate. However, despite  \nthe significant progress made over the last years, the produced plasma antibody concentrations are too low  \nand show too fast of a decay to grant this approach a broad clinical application. Improving in vivo antibody \nproduction is therefore the key focus of this project. We thereto aim to strengthen our proprietary platform  \nfor plasmid DNA-based antibody therapeutics by generating an immunomodulatory toolbox targeted at  \nincreasing in vivo antibody expression. This will be done by mapping the activated immune pathways after in \n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number. This question is optional since not every institution has an internal project number different from the GrantID. Applicants can \nonly provide one project number.  2 Funder(s) GrantID refers to the number of the DMP at the funder(s), here one can specify multiple GrantIDs if multiple funding sources were used.3 Research Organization Registry Community. https://ror.org/\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 2vitro and in vivo plasmid DNA administration. This will be followed by building a toolbox methodology for  \nmodulating the plasmid DNA-induced immunoregulatory responses, and its effects on in vitro and in vivo \nantibody expression will be assessed. The resulting immunomodulatory toolbox will contribute to the  \nmaturation  of  our  proprietary  and  differentiating  antibody  gene  transfer  platform,  by  considerably  \nbroadening its application and competitive edge.\n2.Research Data Summary\nONLY FOR DIGITAL DATAONLY FOR \nDIGITAL DATAONLY FOR DIGITAL DATAONLY FOR \nPHYSICAL DATA\nDataset \nNameDescription New or \nReused Digital or \nPhysical Digital Data Type Digital Data \nFormat Digital Data Volume \n(MB, GB, TB)Physical \nVolume\n1.

Existing data that will be reused are the following: protocols, DNA sequences of plasmids and transgenes \n(antibody/protein) and plasmid DNA (physical samples). All these data were previously generated in the \nlabs of the PI and co-PIs, and are therefore available from this source (no external sources).  \nAre there any ethical issues concerning the \ncreation and/or use of the data  \n(e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual \nuse)? If so, please describe these issues further \nand refer to specific datasets or data types \nwhen appropriate.☐ Yes, human subject data\n☒ Yes, animal data\n☐ Yes, dual use \n☐ No\nIf yes, please describe: All experiments in animals (mice) are approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of \nKU Leuven (project number P149/2022). Guidelines and rules from the HSE (Health, Safety and \nEnvironment) Department and the Animal Ethics Committee of KU Leuven will be followed.\nWill  you process  personal  data4? If  so,  briefly \ndescribe the kind of personal data you will use.  \nPlease refer to specific datasets or data types  \nwhen appropriate. If available, add the reference  \nto  your  file  in  your  host  institution's  privacy  \nregister.☐ Yes\n☒ No\nDoes your work have potential for commercial \nvalorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-\noffs, commercial exploitation, …)?  \nIf so, please comment per dataset or data type \nwhere appropriate.☒ Yes\n☐ No\nThe research data that will be generated in this project hold great potential for tech transfer and \nvalorization. The potential for commercial valorization will be continuously monitored and evaluated by \nthe PharmAbs consortium IOF manager (Dr. Nick Geukens), and further steps in the valorization process \nwill be done in close collaboration with KU Leuven Research & Development (LRD). In this regard, all \n4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10datasets generated within the current project will be reserved for at least 2 years after the end of the \nproject for the launch of a spin-off company. Upon the launch of the spin-off company, KU Leuven will \nlicense commercial exploitation rights on the available proprietary knowledge and patent applications \nenabled by the results obtained in the current project to the spin-off company, and will provide access to \nrelevant background IP and know-how to maximize the value of the spin-off company.\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict \nexploitation or dissemination of the data you \n(re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements,  \nresearch collaboration agreements)?  \nIf so, please explain to what data they relate and  \nwhat restrictions are in place.☐ Yes\n☒ No\nCurrently, there are no 3rd party agreements that restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data we \n(re)use, but this can/will probably change during the course of the project.\nAre there any other legal issues, such as \nintellectual property rights and ownership, to be  \nmanaged related to the data you (re)use?  \nIf so, please explain to what data they relate and  \nwhich restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes\n☒ No\nCurrently, there are no other legal issues, such as IP rights and ownership, to be managed related to the \ndata we (re)use, but this can/will probably change during the course of the project.\n3.Documentation and Metadata\nClearly describe what approach will be followed  \nto  capture  the  accompanying  information  \nnecessary  to  keep  data  understandable  and  \nusable, for yourself and others, now and in the  \nfuture (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and  \ntypes required, procedures used, Electronic Lab  \nNotebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc.  \nwhere this information is recorded).Detailed experimental protocols, the research progress and clear descriptions of obtained data, what they \nrepresent and how they were generated, will be collected in an electronic lab notebook (eLabJournal, \neLabNext, Eppendorf Group at LTDA/PharmAbs; OneNote at LMVGT). Here, folders are provided for all \nsubtasks of the project (folder structure: Project group > Project > Study > Experiment). In each folder, a \nnew file will be made for each experiment, named with the data and subject, and including information on  \nthe responsible person (i.e. the person who created the file) as well as version tracking. Each experimental  \nfile will contain a section on the subject, objective and experimental design, used protocols, used and \ngenerated samples, results (a description of results and observation rather than all raw and analysed data)  \nand conclusion. For each experiment, all raw and analysed data files, supplemented with a .pdf transcript \nof the experiment in the electronic lab notebook, will be stored in a folder on the shared server, using the \nsame hierarchical folder structure as the electronic lab notebook. By using the same structure on the \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11server and in the electronic lab notebook, contextual information on the experimentally obtained data can  \nbe easily searched and reused by a secondary analyst via the electronic lab notebook.\nFor each peer-reviewed article, a separate folder will be made on the server, containing the latest word \nversion and all raw and processed data used in the article. In addition, a separate file will be made in the \nelectronic lab notebook for each article, containing clickable links to all metadata files of data that were \nused in that article, to facilitate tracing back of protocols, results and conclusions\nA physical sample inventory will be stored in freezers and all samples will be added to a digital inventory in  \nthe electronic lab notebook (with links to the experiments in which the samples are generated/used, and a  \nlink to the sample details).\nWill a metadata standard be used to make it \neasier to find and reuse the data ? \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard \nwill be used. If not, please specify which \nmetadata will be created to make the data \neasier to find and reuse.\nREPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN \nFORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. \nSTANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes\n☒ No\nNo uniform metadata standard is available for all different aspects of this project. Therefore, we will \ncreate a uniform system ourselves to enhance the use of secondary data. We will use the electronic lab \nnotebook in which a number of predetermined topics have to be described for each experiment \n(Title/subject, Objective, protocol, results and conclusion). The electronic lab notebook facilitates \nsearching for particular metadata through a search engine. By mimicking the folder structure of the \nelectronic lab notebook in the server-based folder with the experimental data, linking of the metadata to \nthe actual data will be facilitated. Folder names will be descriptive, and file names will have a clear \nmeaning which include: date/date range of the experiment, project or experiment name/number, initials \nof author of the file, type of data and version number of the file.\n4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project\nWhere will the data be stored? The time-stamped digital data will be stored in a project folder on the KU Leuven shared J-drive. The time-\nstamped digital (meta)data will be stored on the server of the electronic lab notebook (eLabJournal, \neLabNext, Eppendorf Group), and a .pdf export of the electronic lab notebook experimental \ndocumentation will be made upon completion of the experiment to be saved in the project folder on the \nKU Leuven shared J-drive. This folder will be open for the lab members participating in this project, and is \nsecured and backed-up by the ICTS service of KU Leuven. The researchers working on the project will ave \ncopies of the data files, as well as of the derived and compiled data stored on their personal computers. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12Paper lab notebooks (in the LMVGT lab) are only used and kept in the L2 lab of the co-PI.\nRegarding the data pertaining to publications, the first author is responsible for storing all raw and \nprocessed data, and metadata, of the paper concerned in a subfolder on the KU Leuven shared J-drive. \nNext to this, all data underlying analyses/figures of the paper concerned will be stored together with the \nanalysed data, tables, figures in the project folder in the electronic lab notebook (eLabJournal, eLabNext, \nEppendorf Group) together with a detailed description of the performed analyses.\nThe physical samples will be stored in the freezers of the labs of the PI and co-PIs. A digital overview of all \nstored samples will be available (either in an Excel file or in the sample inventory system of the electronic \nlab notebook).\nHow will the data be backed up?\nWHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO \nPREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA \nAND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP \nDIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.5\nREFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP \nPROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.The digital data (saved on KU Leuven J-drive) will be stored on the university's central servers with \nautomatic hourly back-up procedures (LTDA/PharmAbs, LMVGT). Backup copies will be made on hard \ndrives and on a local RAID storage available in the office (LCSI).\nThe data stored in the electronic lab notebook (eLabJournal, eLabNext, Eppendorf group) is replicated to 3  \ndifferent data centers in real-time. Additionally, a full back-up of all data files is made every 24 hours. Data  \nback-ups are stored as fully encrypted files to an external vault in case of an emergency and the necessity \nof a full recovery.\nPhysical samples will be kept for 10 years post-project in the freezers of the project collaborators, with 2 \nvials of each crucial sample being stored in different freezers as back-up.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.☒ Yes\n☐ No\nKU Leuven provides sufficient storage and back-up capacity during and after the project. If necessary, the \nvolume of the KU Leuven shared J-drive can be expanded with blocks of 100 GB at any time, for which \nbudget is available.  \nSufficient freezer capacity is available in the different labs.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely Only lab members actively working on the project will have access to the KU Leuven J-drive (access is \n5 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric:  https://osf.io/2z5g3/\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13stored and not accessed or modified by \nunauthorized persons?\nCLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, \nNETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND \nFILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND \nTRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7granted by the PI).\nIn the electronic lab notebook (eLabJournal, eLabNext, Eppendorf group), only the people actively working  \non the project will be granted access to the experimental data of the project (settings by administrators \nfor each individual lab member). Furthermore, after completion, experiments will be signed and locked \ninto a read-only mode, which prevents further data modification, and a digital signature including time \nstamp is added to the experiment\nSecure storage of physical samples and paper notebooks is enabled by locking the laboratory doors when \nresearchers are out of the office. Additionally, only people working in the LTDA/PharmAbs lab can access \nthe lab by using a personnel card reader system, which only allows people working in the lab to enter.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?Data storage on the KU Leuven J-drive with backup will cost 519€ per Tb per year. Each eLabJournal Cloud \nlicense seat costs approximately 150€ per year. Costs will be covered by the laboratory or project \nconsumables budget.\n5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five \nyears (or longer, in agreement with other \nretention policies that are applicable) after the \nend of the project? In case some data cannot be  \npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this  \n(e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All generated research data (physical and digital; raw and processed) will be preserved for at least 10 years  \nafter the end of the project conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. The PI and co-PIs will decide on which \nresearch data will be kept past this timeframe.\nException: for biological samples it is not always possible to keep them for 10 years because of stability \nissues or because of expensive storage at very low temperatures. The PI and co-PIs will decide on which \nsamples are considered valuable, difficult to obtain, likely to be reused and stable, and will preserve those \nbiological samples.

This antibody gene transfer can allow the body to produce its own genetic medicine, and presents an alternative to the complex production and frequent administration of conventional antibody protein therapy. We previously obtained therapeutic proof-of-concept in mice and several plasmid-encoded antibody formats, and demonstrated clinical feasibility in sheep and non-human primate. However, despite the significant progress made over the last years, the produced plasma antibody concentrations are too low and show too fast of a decay to grant this approach a broad clinical application. Improving in vivo antibody production is therefore the key focus of this project. We thereto aim to strengthen our proprietary platform for plasmid DNA-based antibody therapeutics by generating an immunomodulatory toolbox targeted at increasing in vivo antibody expression. This will be done by mapping the activated immune pathways after in 1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

All these data were previously generated in the labs of the PI and co-PIs, and are therefore available from this source (no external sources). Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, please describe these issues further and refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate.☐ Yes, human subject data ☒ Yes, animal data ☐ Yes, dual use ☐ No If yes, please describe: All experiments in animals (mice) are approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of KU Leuven (project number P149/2022). Guidelines and rules from the HSE (Health, Safety and Environment) Department and the Animal Ethics Committee of KU Leuven will be followed. Will you process personal data4? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. If available, add the reference to your file in your host institution's privacy register.☐ Yes ☒ No Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin- offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate.☒ Yes ☐ No The research data that will be generated in this project hold great potential for tech transfer and valorization. The potential for commercial valorization will be continuously monitored and evaluated by the PharmAbs consortium IOF manager (Dr. Nick Geukens), and further steps in the valorization process will be done in close collaboration with KU Leuven Research & Development (LRD). In this regard, all 4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10datasets generated within the current project will be reserved for at least 2 years after the end of the project for the launch of a spin-off company. Upon the launch of the spin-off company, KU Leuven will license commercial exploitation rights on the available proprietary knowledge and patent applications enabled by the results obtained in the current project to the spin-off company, and will provide access to relevant background IP and know-how to maximize the value of the spin-off company. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.☐ Yes ☒ No Currently, there are no 3rd party agreements that restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data we (re)use, but this can/will probably change during the course of the project. Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes ☒ No Currently, there are no other legal issues, such as IP rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data we (re)use, but this can/will probably change during the course of the project. 3.Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded).Detailed experimental protocols, the research progress and clear descriptions of obtained data, what they represent and how they were generated, will be collected in an electronic lab notebook (eLabJournal, eLabNext, Eppendorf Group at LTDA/PharmAbs; OneNote at LMVGT). Here, folders are provided for all subtasks of the project (folder structure: Project group > Project > Study > Experiment). In each folder, a new file will be made for each experiment, named with the data and subject, and including information on the responsible person (i.e. the person who created the file) as well as version tracking. Each experimental file will contain a section on the subject, objective and experimental design, used protocols, used and generated samples, results (a description of results and observation rather than all raw and analysed data) and conclusion. For each experiment, all raw and analysed data files, supplemented with a .pdf transcript of the experiment in the electronic lab notebook, will be stored in a folder on the shared server, using the same hierarchical folder structure as the electronic lab notebook. By using the same structure on the FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11server and in the electronic lab notebook, contextual information on the experimentally obtained data can be easily searched and reused by a secondary analyst via the electronic lab notebook. For each peer-reviewed article, a separate folder will be made on the server, containing the latest word version and all raw and processed data used in the article. In addition, a separate file will be made in the electronic lab notebook for each article, containing clickable links to all metadata files of data that were used in that article, to facilitate tracing back of protocols, results and conclusions A physical sample inventory will be stored in freezers and all samples will be added to a digital inventory in the electronic lab notebook (with links to the experiments in which the samples are generated/used, and a link to the sample details). Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No No uniform metadata standard is available for all different aspects of this project. Therefore, we will create a uniform system ourselves to enhance the use of secondary data. We will use the electronic lab notebook in which a number of predetermined topics have to be described for each experiment (Title/subject, Objective, protocol, results and conclusion). The electronic lab notebook facilitates searching for particular metadata through a search engine. By mimicking the folder structure of the electronic lab notebook in the server-based folder with the experimental data, linking of the metadata to the actual data will be facilitated. Folder names will be descriptive, and file names will have a clear meaning which include: date/date range of the experiment, project or experiment name/number, initials of author of the file, type of data and version number of the file. 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? The time-stamped digital data will be stored in a project folder on the KU Leuven shared J-drive. The time- stamped digital (meta)data will be stored on the server of the electronic lab notebook (eLabJournal, eLabNext, Eppendorf Group), and a .pdf export of the electronic lab notebook experimental documentation will be made upon completion of the experiment to be saved in the project folder on the KU Leuven shared J-drive. This folder will be open for the lab members participating in this project, and is secured and backed-up by the ICTS service of KU Leuven. The researchers working on the project will ave copies of the data files, as well as of the derived and compiled data stored on their personal computers. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12Paper lab notebooks (in the LMVGT lab) are only used and kept in the L2 lab of the co-PI. Regarding the data pertaining to publications, the first author is responsible for storing all raw and processed data, and metadata, of the paper concerned in a subfolder on the KU Leuven shared J-drive. Next to this, all data underlying analyses/figures of the paper concerned will be stored together with the analysed data, tables, figures in the project folder in the electronic lab notebook (eLabJournal, eLabNext, Eppendorf Group) together with a detailed description of the performed analyses. The physical samples will be stored in the freezers of the labs of the PI and co-PIs. A digital overview of all stored samples will be available (either in an Excel file or in the sample inventory system of the electronic lab notebook). How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.5 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.The digital data (saved on KU Leuven J-drive) will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic hourly back-up procedures (LTDA/PharmAbs, LMVGT). Backup copies will be made on hard drives and on a local RAID storage available in the office (LCSI). The data stored in the electronic lab notebook (eLabJournal, eLabNext, Eppendorf group) is replicated to 3 different data centers in real-time. Additionally, a full back-up of all data files is made every 24 hours. Data back-ups are stored as fully encrypted files to an external vault in case of an emergency and the necessity of a full recovery. Physical samples will be kept for 10 years post-project in the freezers of the project collaborators, with 2 vials of each crucial sample being stored in different freezers as back-up. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No KU Leuven provides sufficient storage and back-up capacity during and after the project. If necessary, the volume of the KU Leuven shared J-drive can be expanded with blocks of 100 GB at any time, for which budget is available. Sufficient freezer capacity is available in the different labs. How will you ensure that the data are securely Only lab members actively working on the project will have access to the KU Leuven J-drive (access is 5 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?

In the electronic lab notebook (eLabJournal, eLabNext, Eppendorf group), only the people actively working on the project will be granted access to the experimental data of the project (settings by administrators for each individual lab member). Furthermore, after completion, experiments will be signed and locked into a read-only mode, which prevents further data modification, and a digital signature including time stamp is added to the experiment Secure storage of physical samples and paper notebooks is enabled by locking the laboratory doors when researchers are out of the office. Additionally, only people working in the LTDA/PharmAbs lab can access the lab by using a personnel card reader system, which only allows people working in the lab to enter. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Data storage on the KU Leuven J-drive with backup will cost 519€ per Tb per year. Each eLabJournal Cloud license seat costs approximately 150€ per year. Costs will be covered by the laboratory or project consumables budget. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All generated research data (physical and digital; raw and processed) will be preserved for at least 10 years after the end of the project conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. The PI and co-PIs will decide on which research data will be kept past this timeframe. Exception: for biological samples it is not always possible to keep them for 10 years because of stability issues or because of expensive storage at very low temperatures. The PI and co-PIs will decide on which samples are considered valuable, difficult to obtain, likely to be reused and stable, and will preserve those biological samples. Samples that are easy to reproduce and those that are unstable will be discarded, but documentation and metadata related to these samples will be retained, and it will be indicated why these samples were discarded. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?The digital data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic backup procedures) and paper lab notebooks will be kept in locked cabinets in the lab of the PIs concerned for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. The physical data will be stored in freezers in the labs of the PI and co-PIs for up to 10 years after the project (exception: see point 5.1). What are the expected costs for data Data storage on the KU Leuven J-drive with backup costs 519€ per Tb per year (current fee). Costs will be FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?covered by the laboratory budget. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☐ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☐ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☒ Other, please specify: The key findings of the project and their interpretation will be made available through publication of journal articles in established, peer-reviewed academic journals. Relevant data will be made available after publication upon reasonable request by email. These published data contain the results of processed data presented in tables. Data with valuable IP will be protected prior to publication. Unpublished data will be used for future grant applications/publications, and as such, can only be communicated privately to selected colleagues for as long as the IP potential has not been cleared by LRD. This is a precautionary measure to avoid compromising the IP potential of the work. Since the research data that will be generated in this project hold great potential for tech transfer and valorization, the datasets generated within the current project will be reserved for at least 2 years after the end of the project for the launch of a spin-off company. Upon the launch of the spin-off company, KU Leuven will license commercial exploitation rights on the available proprietary knowledge and patent applications enabled by the results obtained in the current project to the spin-off company, and will provide access to relevant background IP and know-how to maximize the value of the spin-off company. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Access to data, concerning ongoing, unpublished research, will be restricted to the researchers participating in the specific project as long as they are affiliated to KU Leuven. Once published, data will be accessible to all, either through reading the relevant paper, or upon reasonable request to the authors by email. For data shared directly by the PIs, a material/data transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted (usually under a CC BY-NC reuse license). Commercial-based requests will be FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 15navigated in coordination between the involved (co-)PI(s) and KU Leuven LRD. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☒ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No The research data that will be generated in this project hold great potential for tech transfer and valorization. In this regard, datasets generated within the current project will be reserved for at least 2 years after the end of the project for the launch of a spin-off company. Upon the launch of the spin-off company, KU Leuven will license commercial exploitation rights on the available proprietary knowledge and patent applications enabled by the results obtained in the current project to the spin-off company, and will provide access to relevant background IP and know-how to maximize the value of the spin-off company. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.All digital data will be stored and be available for lab members using a shared network drive (KU Leuven J- drive) provided by the university. In addition, the relevant data will be made available to external people upon reasonable request by email. In case of data sharing outside KU Leuven, the universities’ privacy and legal experts will be consulted prior to data sharing to regulate the data sharing process (e.g. data/material transfer agreement, non-disclosure agreement). When will the data be made available? Data will only made available to other researchers after publication of the research results. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, potential IP requirements (note: patent application filing will be planned so that publications need not to be delayed) or ongoing projects requiring data confidentiality. In those cases, datasets will be made available as soon as the embargo is lifted. Additional, non-published data can be made available for external researchers upon reasonable request (based on LRD contract). Furthermore, data with IP (potential) will be reserved and thus not shared for at least 2 years after the end of the project for the launch of a spin-off company.

Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes ☒ No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? We will minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for (meta)data collection, and file/sample storage and organization from the start of the project. The expected data management/sharing costs will therefore be minimal and will be covered by the laboratory budget of the project. For sharing physical samples, costs for sharing will be discussed with the receiving party on a case- by-case basis. Publication costs (open access) will be covered by the consumables budget of the project. 7. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project?The PI (Prof. Maarten Dewilde; LTDA/PharmAbs), the co-PIs (Prof. Abhishek Garg (LCSI), Prof. Rik Gijsbers (LMVGT)) and the project leader (Dr. Debby Thomas; LTDA/PharmAbs) will be responsible for documentation of data and metadata.
