Where will the data be stored? Shared network drive (J-drive) Personal network drive (I-drive) OneDrive (KU Leuven) ● OneDrive (KU Leuven) ● Personal network drive (I-drive) ● Large Volume Storage ● Shared network drive (J-drive) The host institute provides a secure data storage system (KU Leuven LUNA servers) with automated onsite back-up and mirroring. Generated experimental data will be stored on both the KU Leuven LUNA Large Volume Storage space (L-drive) and the internally shared network drive (J-drive). Copies will be made and kept on personal drives (I-drive). Protocols and SOPs are stored on the Shared network drive J. For active use of the data during the project, OneDrive will ensure data transfer between computers. We expect max 10 Tb of data to be stored. The physcial data, consisting of (immuno)histologically stained tissue sections, biochemical samples (protein extracts, mRNA), western blots, etc. will be stored in freezers/fridges and closets in the lab. Also unstained paraffin/cryo sections will be stored at a dry/cold place for possible future use. The inventory of all locations is shared on the KU Leuven LUNA Shared drive.

How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? All network storage is hosted in the KU Leuven ICTS data center, with a mirror in the second ICTS center, to provide disaster recovery and additional back-up capacity, thus guaranteeing long-term data availability. Access to data is conditioned by KU Leuven security groups. All data will be password protected at the locations. For OneDrive, we only share folders with relevant involved persons.

Due to physical preservation issues and storage limitations, we can only keep the fixed/frozen samples and stained sections for max up to 3 years. For most publications we expect that we will make the data publicly available on data repositories. Retained data: Publications (experimental manuscripts, review papers, PhD) stored in Lirias. Regular progress and final reports (as ppt and doc files) Processed experimental data (as xls files) Not retained data: Raw experimental data (as csv, txt, xls,.. format) - easy and low cost reproducibility Samples taken from experiments will be documented and stored for up to three years after the end of the project. Storage will be in fixative or frozen depending on the kind of sample. IHC/HCR stained slides will be stored in appropriate boxes in a dry place or in the freezer.

Written progress reports will be stored for internal purposes and can be accessed by KU Leuven researchers upon request. Relevant findings will be disseminated through publication in high profile, peer-reviewed international journals within the life science field. The data will be made available after publication via the required link in the publications or upon request after an embargo period after publication. The same holds true for unpublished data, they can be made available upon request but only after an embargo period and prior to evaluation on a per case basis.

Responsibilities Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project? Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project? The postdocs and PhD students will manage their own data and data documentation during the project based on mutual agreements about data sets. They will be assisted by the professors and project managers. Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project? Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project? The professors (Lut Arckens, Lieve Moons) will take a helicopter view on data management (assign roles, specify access permissions etc.). The project managers (Laura Trullemans, Caroline Zandecki) will be backed-up by other group members involved in project management (IOF valorization managers: Bert Lagrain, Annelii Ny). Who will manage data preservation and sharing? Who will manage data preservation and sharing? Data documentation, data storage & backup during the project is the responsibility of all researchers working on this project, and will be managed by the project managers (Laura Trullemans, Caroline Zandecki, Bert Lagrain, Annelii Ny) as well as the PIs (Lut Arckens, Lieve Moons).
