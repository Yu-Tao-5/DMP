This project will achieve two main goals. First, it will argue that literature\nis particularly well-suited to explore the activist political mind. Specifically, this project will\nprofoundly change our image of the German labour movementâ€™s culture, history and politics,\nby exploring a prolific body of literary texts that critically represent former activists and historical\nprotest movements. Second, this project will use literature as a testcase to develop a new\ncomprehensive method to examine activist memory cultures and to explore how socio-political\nchange is imagined. The literary corpus of this project is a constitutive element of a broader\nmemory culture which consists of various multimedial practices of recollection. Among these,\nliterature plays a prevalent and decisive role as an interdiscursive medium. Against this\nbackground, this project will explore activist memories as dynamic images of collective agency\nwhich are characterized by their mobilizing use of political affects and visions of historical\nchangeability. In its pursuit of these two goals, this project will pilot future and interdisciplinary\nresearch in the culture and discourses of social movements.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nReuse existing data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 5\nType of data\nFormat\nVolume\nOrigins\nScanned images\nof archivel\ndocuments\njpeg, gif, pdf\n10 GB\nDocument\nscanning from\npaper-based\narchival\ndocuments\n(newspapers,\nbooks,\npamphlets...):\nlibrary or\narchival\ncollections\nInsights from\nliterature review\n(corpus analysis)\ntextual; PDF,\n.doc\n2 GB\nPublished works\nand books\nData in analogue\nform\n=\n=\nExternal\nacquisition and\npurchase\n \n3. Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nIt is not to be excluded that correspondence or diaries of writers (published or archived) from the\nperiod 1848-1900 will be cited in publications, yet this is standard practice in literary history.\nRecourse will be taken to fair-use practices we will comply with international copyright laws when\npublishing results that include such cited materials.\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nNo\nThe data used and created in this project present no ethical issues. No experiments on humans\nor animals will be conducted. Citations from writers’ published or unpublished personal\ndocuments present no ethical issue as long as they fall under ‘fair use’.\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nYes\nYes, if such third party agreements also include copyright laws applicable to certain sources\nunder investigation in the project. In compliance with these copyright laws we may need to clear\nrights and obtain permission for quoting the work of certain literary authors. As this is standard\npractice in literary studies, all necessary precautions will be taken to ensure that we work in\ncorrespondence with applicable copyrights. As such, copyright will not interfere\nwith dissemination of the project's results.\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 5\nGiven the literary historical nature of the project, the process of data gathering and corpus\nconstruction for each of the work packages will be documented extensively.  Each document\ncontaining research data will receive a transparent, uniform file name and the collection of these\ndocuments will be accompanied by a separate document describing the data gathering process\nand the structure of the file collection. It should also be noted that the methodological section of\neach of the projected dissertations will extensively describe the data gathering process. Each of\nthe individual projects has a designated folder on the KU Leuven shared network drives\ncontaining all research data documents and the ‘meta-document’ describing the collection.\nExample:\nRemembering the Possible[folder]\nCorpus analysis: author X [folder]\nData guide [document]\nResearch data [folder]\n[documents]\nIn the documentation, special attention will be paid to the gathering of hard-to-obtain data, e.g.\ndata stored in archives with restricted access or textual information that could not be reproduced\non site (e.g. photocopied, photographed or transcribed). The meta-document accompanying the\nresearch data file collection will describe how the researcher obtained access to these data (e.g.\ncontact information of archive staff member, file numbers, box numbers, etc.), in order to make\nit possible for other researchers to follow the same track.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nYes\nAs the research data files are created in MS Office they automatically possess certain metadata\n(file name, author/creator, date, etc.) found under ‘Properties’ à ‘Details’. To allow for easier\naccess and reuse, researchers add ‘Tags’ to their files, i.e. the relevant individual sub-project and\na set of keywords drawn from the MLA Thesaurus controlled vocabularies. By searching on\nkeywords in the shared folders, each researcher will easily find research data created by another\nresearcher; they can then retrieve the file(s) from the folder in which they are stored.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nAll digital data for this project will be preserved for a period of minimum 10 years after the end of\nthe research, according to the KU Leuven’s Research Data Management Plan. 1) The analogue\ndata for this project will be preserved by KU Leuven Libraries (Artes), who will include it into their\nlibrary collection. Access will be provided via the library's catalogue limo.libis.be. 2) The digital\ndata will be stored on a KU Leuven OneDrive folder managed by me. After the project, the data\nwill be stored on the faculty's network drives in agreement with the faculty's IT division.\nThe analogue data (books and other resources acquired with the project's funding) will be stored\nand made available to other researchers through the Artes library. This will ensure the\npreservation and availability of these resources to those interested.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe digital data will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic backup, as\nprovided by our university IT teams. These data will be also saved on external hard disks\nmanages by myself.\n \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nYes, during this project I will have constant access to the university's network drives, which\nsuffice for the amount of data to be stored.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 5\nwill these costs be covered?\nThe costs of the network drives is covered by the Faculty and university.\nExternal hard drives can be procured off the project's budget.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nThe data in this project are classified as 'low risk'. Sufficient security is included by the shared\nnetwork drives managed by the Faculty's IT division.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nIn agreement with the faculty's IT division data will be stored on the faculty's network drives for a\nperiod of 5 years after the project.\nAll books collected for the project will be kept in the Artes library.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nArchiving will be discussed with the faculty's IT division.\nBooks stay in the Artes collection.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nA cost estimate will be made with regard to the long-term storage of data on the faculty's\nnetwork drives. In light of the type of data to be stored, this cost can be safely assumed to be\nrelatively small and fundable out of the project budget.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nYes. Specify:\nData will mainly be shared through publications and webinars, lecture series  and conference\nvideos.
