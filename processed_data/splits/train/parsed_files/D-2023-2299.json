The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.  \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Pieter Vanden Berghe ORCID: 0000-0002-0009-2094\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Luigi Bonacina (University of Geneva):  ORCID: 0000-0002-4277-3664\nSebastian Karpf (University of Lübeck):  \nProject number 1 & title ADAPT: Adaptive and predictive arbitrary point scanning two photon tomography\nFunder(s) GrantID 2G070223N\nAffiliation(s) X  KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nROR identifier KU Leuven: 05f950310\nPlease provide a short project description Two photon (2P) microscopy is an ideal technique to image deep inside tissues and organisms, with good sub-cellular axial \nresolution and without causing tissue damage. These advantages make 2P microscopy suited for intravital imaging, which can \nbe used to investigate how neuronal circuits operate in normal and fail in diseased conditions. However, the current recording \nspeeds of 2P microscopy are a limiting factor. They do not allow imaging at frame rates necessary to capture neuronal activity at  \nhundreds or thousands images per second, especially not in three dimensions (3D). This project aims at ADAPTing the spectro-\ntemporal laser imaging by diffractive excitation (SLIDE) technique previously introduced by the promoter, to enable fast \nneuroimaging. The specific ADAPTations include: 1/ acquiring volumetric data of layered neuronal structures at timescales that \nmatch functional processes; 2/ developing a dedicated near infrared source to SLIDE-2P-excite green genetically encoded \ncalcium indicators; 3/ correcting wavefront distortions and 4/ introducing rapid adaptive scanning and sampling. ADAPT \ncombines expertise in laser physics (S. Karpf), nanophotonics, nonlinear optics (L. Bonacina) and neurogastroenterology (P. \nVanden Berghe) to develop this bespoke solution for fast 3D imaging, which will be applied to visualize activity patterns in the \nenteric nervous system, a multicellular network embedded in the gut wall that controls motility, absorption and secretion.\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number. This question is optional. Applicants can only provide one project number.  2 Funder(s) GrantID refers to the number of the DMP at the funder(s), here one can specify multiple GrantIDs if multiple funding sources were used.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 3\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

Since most \nof the images are highly experimental and explorative, there is no need to keep a copy of the original data.  \nHowever, upon first analysis the images that are judged of sufficient quality to derive conclusive data, will \nbe analysed as saved on the researcher’s computer with a backup either on a local external harddrive or \nvia the LUNA network.\nExchange of data between will happen via the LUNA network, which keeps track of versions and assures \nsafe backups. In case data need to be shared with the partners in the WEAVE project, we will use BELNET \nfor data transfer of large files.\nWithin the FWO IRI project FBI, we are investigating future overarching datastorage and datamanagement \nsolutions based on the IRODS / Mango pipelines.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nWHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO \nPREVENT DATA LOSS? ☒ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution\n☐ Personal back-ups I make (specify)\n☒ Other (specify) \nAs from the first steps of analysis, the data will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic  \ndaily back-up procedures or - in case too large - on local hard drives with a local backup system (e.g. \nGenie).\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 8Is there currently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.☒ Yes\n☐ No\nWe have over a decade of experience recording and dealing with images and large datafiles, which we \nstore and backup in mixed modes. For analysed images and results we use the servers (and their backup) \nof the LUNA network, for original data or versions of analysed image files we store locally on internal and \nexternal harddrives. Each researcher has internal as well as external PC storage and manages their data in \na conscious and well thought off fashion, with necessary backups while at the same time avoiding multiple \ncopies of less successful recordings.\nIf no, please specify:  \nHow will you ensure that the data are securely \nstored and not accessed or modified by \nunauthorized persons?\nCLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, \nNETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND \nFILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND \nTRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. \nGuidance on security for research data  The data files from this study will be managed, processed, and stored on LUNA PCs and network, which \ncan only be access by KU Leuven personnel. Access to the network storage is limited to the personnel \naccounts that belong to the lab of the promoter of the project.  \nExternal HD are stored in closed offices.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?16 TB external/internal HDs cost ~ 400 Euro, and thus extra storage capacity for this project is not an issue.\nThe cost for 300 Gb storage on the LUNA network is ~ 75 Euro/y, which is all well within reach of the \nproject budget.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 95.

Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☒ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): All original data that were used to generate the scientific output (papers, reports) will be stored for 10 years on external HD. These HD will be stored in closed closets in the lab of the promoter or copromoter where the data have been generated. All analysis files used for publishing and reporting will be compressed and stored on Archive directories on the LUNA network. As mentioned above, HD for the original data (of which not all is valuable enough to store in locations with multiple backups). Analyzed files with relevant information will be stored on KU Leuven Archive servers conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?A 16 TB HD costs ~ 400 Euro which is a minimal cost compared to the running costs of the microscopy equipment and the animal housing cost. Storage for 50 Euro/TB/y = 500 Euro/TB for the storage during 10 years. We estimate 3 Tb of data will be stored on these Archive servers: 1500 Euro. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS.

If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☒ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☐ No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? None. Belnet can be used to transfer and give temporary access to the requested data. 7. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project?Each of the individual researchers involved in the project and the supervisor for each site. KU Leuven data will be managed and supervised at KU Leuven. Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project?Each of the individual researchers involved in the project and the supervisor at each site. Who will manage data preservation and sharing?The project supervisor: Pieter Vanden Berghe, for the data generated at KU Leuven. Who will update and implement this DMP? The end responsibility for updating and implementing the DMP is with the supervisor (promotor). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13"
