However,\nPD patients often fail to consolidate new skills into long-term memory, thus reducing the efficacy of training. Interestingly, sleep facilitates motor\nmemory consolidation in healthy adults, especially in combination with targeted memory reactivation (TMR). TMR works by adding task-related\nsounds during learning that are replayed during\nsubsequent sleep to reinforce the memory trace. Importantly, recent work suggests that sleep-dependent consolidation may be preserved in PD, but\nrobust findings are lacking and have not\ninvolved TMR. I will address this gap by investigating the effect of sleep and TMR on motor memory consolidation in PD. First, I will detail the\nimpact of sleep impairment on memory consolidation in PD. Then, I will test the effect of TMR applied during sleep on consolidation using both a\nconventional TMR setup as well as a highly innovative closed-loop application that automatically sends stimuli at the specific up-phase of slow\noscillations to achieve optimal learning. Finally, I will describe the neurophysiological processes underpinning these effects using state-of-the-art\nneuroimaging. Overall, this project will pave the way for new sleep interventions to boost rehabilitation for PD and will provide much-needed insight\ninto how we can leverage sleep physiology to rescue core motor difficulties of PD.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n20-02-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

However, PD patients often fail to consolidate new skills into long-term memory, thus reducing the efficacy of training. Interestingly, sleep facilitates motor memory consolidation in healthy adults, especially in combination with targeted memory reactivation (TMR). TMR works by adding task-related sounds during learning that are replayed during subsequent sleep to reinforce the memory trace. Importantly, recent work suggests that sleep-dependent consolidation may be preserved in PD, but robust findings are lacking and have not involved TMR. I will address this gap by investigating the effect of sleep and TMR on motor memory consolidation in PD. First, I will detail the impact of sleep impairment on memory consolidation in PD. Then, I will test the effect of TMR applied during sleep on consolidation using both a conventional TMR setup as well as a highly innovative closed-loop application that automatically sends stimuli at the specific up-phase of slow oscillations to achieve optimal learning. Finally, I will describe the neurophysiological processes underpinning these effects using state-of-the-art neuroimaging. Overall, this project will pave the way for new sleep interventions to boost rehabilitation for PD and will provide much-needed insight into how we can leverage sleep physiology to rescue core motor difficulties of PD.

Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Digital data will be stored on a secured Large Volume Storage (L-drive) of the KU Leuven with automated backup, for the duration of the project. After completion of the project, this data will be migrated and archived on a secured Large Volume Storage (K-drive) of the KU Leuven, with automated backup that is specifically developed to archive large amounts of electronic data for long periods of time. Additionally, copies can be made on the individual work pc of the researchers involved in the project during data analysis, after which the data will be transferred to the L-drive. The paper copies of the CRF’s will be stored in a secured locker at the Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Building The Nayer, of the KU Leuven. The paper copies that contain identifiable information (i.e. consent forms and subject identification logs) will be stored separately from the other data in a separate folder in a separate cabinet in a separate room. Only authorized personnel will have access to this locked storage room as they will need to be granted access by the PI (Moran Gilat). How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up?
