Heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes, CMs) experience ageing-associated alterations\nleading to a lower functional output, caused by (among others) maladaptive remodelling of the myocardium, including hypertrophy of\nindividual cardiomyocytes. CMs are long-lived (decades) and have limited proliferative capacity. Transcriptional variation\n(heterogeneity) between CMs increase with age, with potentially detrimental consequences for heart function. Not only does this reflect\ndysregulation of gene transcriptional control in individual cells, it also likely reflects changes in CM subpopulations/states, such as the\nratio of maladapted hypertrophic- to normal CMs. Transcription is regulated in part by DNA methylation (DNAm) (an epigenetic\nmodification). Curiously, global DNAm decreases with age. Our data show that the expression of the TET2 DNA demethylase\nincreases with age, with profound inter-CM heterogeneity. We hypothesize that changes in DNAm patterns induce transcriptional\nremodelling underlying dysfunction during normal ageing of CMs. We further propose that the increased variability in transcriptomes\nbetween CMs in ageing is mediated by stochastic alterations in DNAm brought about by increased TET2 expression.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n27-02-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Biological samples are kept inside -80°C freezers for at least 5 years\nafter the end of the research. Digital data are kept on the K and L drives for at least 5 years after the end of the research. Bulk raw data (>1 TB sequencing data)\nwill be transferred to 2 separate external harddrives. Samples and data may be kept for longer, in case they can be reused by other researchers within the\ndepartment.\nDerivatives of human samples (e.g. isolated RNA, DNA) will be deposited into the biobank. The\nnecessary storage room for the expected amount of biological material is already ascertained at the biobank.\nAll digital data are stored on the lab's L and K drive. Only members of the lab who were granted permission to access these data can access these data; e.g. students are not\ngranted access to data which is not relevant to their training.\nUpon manuscript acceptance, raw sequencing data are deposited onto NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and publicly accessible. Scripts (R) are deposited onto github and\npublicly accessible. \nDuring the research, proper storage of data is the responsibility of dr. Ronda. After the research, this responsibility shifts to prof. Roderick.

Methods are documented as digital SOPs and maintained in a shared database in the lab as .docx. All SOPs\nhave a version number with the author of the version indicated.\nExperiments will be documented in lab books. Each book contains the name and contact information of the author. As multiple books exist, each is numbered. Each page\ninside the lab book is numbered and dated. Each pahe contains a header containing the experimental code (e.g. OR53) and a running title describing the subsequent\nexperimental notes (e.g. cDNA synthesis from RNA using SS3). An SOP is referenced. For experiments which use biological reagents such as antibodies, care is now also\ntaken to include lot/batch numbers of reagents.\nFor animal experiments, procedures are documented in the LAIS (Leuven Animal Information System), whereby the origin/heritage and exact experimental procedures and\ntimings are documented.\nThe lab increasingly makes use of videography and photography to document e.g. murine surgeries for training and documentation purposes.

If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nWe currently have no metadata standard. However, where data is collected on specific equipment, e.g. confocal (imaging), FACS (cytometry), LICOR (westernblot), metadata\nrelating to acquisition parameters are collected. In general, we collect and store as much metadata as possible, and the digital files are stored inside a directory structure\nindicating a static experimental code (e.g. OR53), inside sub-directories indicating analysis type (e.g. qpcr, imaging, sequencing). The static experimental codes are used\nthroughout the data structure and lab books, so that its code + date are sufficient to cross-reference digital data to paper lab books and vice-versa.\nIn brief, raw data files are always dated, annotated with the experiment's code, the sample's ID, and any relevant parameters. \n \nExample 1\nExample 1\n: a typical confocal microscopy file will be named as below.

Data storage & back-up during the research project\n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nWhere will the data be stored?\nData is temporarily stored during collection on related equipment (e.g. confocal microscopy PC, echocardiography PC). Data is immediately transferred to network drives –\nKUL L drive (large volume storage). On a 6 monthly basis, and upon publishing, data are transferred to the KUL archive K drive. \nData is shared between labs using Belnet FileSender (https://filesender.belnet.be/). There are no costs (to the researcher) associated with the use of this service. \nHow will the data be backed up?\nHow will the data be backed up?\nDigital data are backed up and versioned automatically by their storage on the L drive (large volume storage). ICTS is responsible for the automatic versioning and backup\n(mirroring) of all data stored on the shared network drives including the large volume drive.\nPhysical data (e.g. biological samples) cannot be backed up, but are continously monitored using the aeroscout temperature monitoring system. At all times, there is a person\non-call in case of -80°C and -20°C freezer failure and over-temp.

Heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes, CMs) experience ageing-associated alterations leading to a lower functional output, caused by (among others) maladaptive remodelling of the myocardium, including hypertrophy of individual cardiomyocytes. CMs are long-lived (decades) and have limited proliferative capacity. Transcriptional variation (heterogeneity) between CMs increase with age, with potentially detrimental consequences for heart function. Not only does this reflect dysregulation of gene transcriptional control in individual cells, it also likely reflects changes in CM subpopulations/states, such as the ratio of maladapted hypertrophic- to normal CMs. Transcription is regulated in part by DNA methylation (DNAm) (an epigenetic modification). Curiously, global DNAm decreases with age. Our data show that the expression of the TET2 DNA demethylase increases with age, with profound inter-CM heterogeneity. We hypothesize that changes in DNAm patterns induce transcriptional remodelling underlying dysfunction during normal ageing of CMs. We further propose that the increased variability in transcriptomes between CMs in ageing is mediated by stochastic alterations in DNAm brought about by increased TET2 expression.

Day-to-day documentation is performed in a paper bound lab book. Methods are documented as digital SOPs and maintained in a shared database in the lab as .docx. All SOPs have a version number with the author of the version indicated. Experiments will be documented in lab books. Each book contains the name and contact information of the author. As multiple books exist, each is numbered. Each page inside the lab book is numbered and dated. Each pahe contains a header containing the experimental code (e.g. OR53) and a running title describing the subsequent experimental notes (e.g. cDNA synthesis from RNA using SS3). An SOP is referenced. For experiments which use biological reagents such as antibodies, care is now also taken to include lot/batch numbers of reagents. For animal experiments, procedures are documented in the LAIS (Leuven Animal Information System), whereby the origin/heritage and exact experimental procedures and timings are documented. The lab increasingly makes use of videography and photography to document e.g. murine surgeries for training and documentation purposes. Other laboratory methodologies e.g. FACS enjoy increasing use of photography and including these images into SOPs for improved clarity by follow-up or novice users. On a 6 monthly basis, data is transferred to the Archive K drive of KUL. This data is stored under a laboratory-agreed format, including with metadata, and is read-only after copy transfer. Research carried out during this project will be published in academic journals that will be openly accessible to our peers, as well as openly accessible to the public. Detailed methods and links to deposited data that will allow repeat of experiments and data re-interrogation respectively will be included in the manuscripts. Large data sets, metadata and non published findings will be deposited in online repositories such as https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/ and the KUL repository RDR (https://rdr.kuleuven.be/). Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data?

If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. No We currently have no metadata standard. However, where data is collected on specific equipment, e.g. confocal (imaging), FACS (cytometry), LICOR (westernblot), metadata relating to acquisition parameters are collected. In general, we collect and store as much metadata as possible, and the digital files are stored inside a directory structure indicating a static experimental code (e.g. OR53), inside sub-directories indicating analysis type (e.g. qpcr, imaging, sequencing). The static experimental codes are used throughout the data structure and lab books, so that its code + date are sufficient to cross-reference digital data to paper lab books and vice-versa. In brief, raw data files are always dated, annotated with the experiment's code, the sample's ID, and any relevant parameters. Example 1 Example 1 : a typical confocal microscopy file will be named as below. The filename indicates the acquisition date in a numerically machine-sortable way, the species (mouse), tissue type (heart), the animal's ID no (126), lens configuration (40x), section and field number (technical replicates), dyes or antibodies used on each channel. Each microscopy experiment is accompanied by a notes.txt which describes the exact dyes and antibodies and at which dilution they were used, and any specific details related to the experiment. 2022-11-28_Mouse_heart_126_40x_section3_field3_DAPI_(blue)_Tet2_Abe364_(green)_ACTN2_(red)_WGA_(cyan).nd2 Example 2: Example 2: a typical FACS experiment file will be named as below. The filename indicates the acquisition date in a numerically machine-sortable way, indicates the sample's ID, and indicates whether it relates to an analysis or a sort. Each sample is stored as as .fcs as well as a .pdf which is an export from the facs machine's software, which describes the optical and laser configuration, the sensor's amplification and thresholding settings, the gating, and the (sorted) counts. Each experiment is accompanied by a document containing screenshots on the machine's droplet stream, system parameters and other remarked info. 2022-12-01_06_HD26_SORT In addition: For patient samples patient samples , metadata are noted in a shared database with criteria related to the isolation and use of derivatives included as well as quality of sample. For animal samples animal samples , metadata are recorded in LAIS (https://lais.cidercone.com/), and in excel sheets on a per-experiment basis. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Data is temporarily stored during collection on related equipment (e.g. confocal microscopy PC, echocardiography PC). Data is immediately transferred to network drives – KUL L drive (large volume storage). On a 6 monthly basis, and upon publishing, data are transferred to the KUL archive K drive. Data is shared between labs using Belnet FileSender (https://filesender.belnet.be/). There are no costs (to the researcher) associated with the use of this service. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Digital data are backed up and versioned automatically by their storage on the L drive (large volume storage). ICTS is responsible for the automatic versioning and backup (mirroring) of all data stored on the shared network drives including the large volume drive. Physical data (e.g. biological samples) cannot be backed up, but are continously monitored using the aeroscout temperature monitoring system. At all times, there is a person on-call in case of -80°C and -20°C freezer failure and over-temp. At all times, we have access to a backup -80°C and -20°C freezer, to move samples from a failing freezer to an operational one. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. No The lab currently has 10 TB storage space on the L large volume network drive, of which approx 2 TB is available. This would not be sufficient for the projected data of this project. However, I foresee that (over time) additional space is made available by moving old datasets to the K archive drive, and/or by requesting additional storage space. Through these means, sufficient space will be available for this DMP's project. Costs of digital data storage will be paid for using lab funds. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Data are securely stored by their storage on the KUL network drives. Data are not stored on personal computers or external harddrives / devices. Access to the lab's shared L drive is restricted to members of the lab. Students and non-lab members are not given access to these resources. Inside the shared drive are personal Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 27 February 2023 7 of 9 directories for each lab members. It is agreed upon in the lab that these directories can not be modified by other lab members. Upon archival of raw data onto the K archive drive, data can be read but cannot be modified by researchers. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The current price of the L drive is €569,2 / 5.0 TB / year. The current price of the K drive is €284,6 / 5.0 TB / year. This research project will gradually generate data. As soon as possible, the raw data are transferred to the K drive. For the 3 year duration of this project, the projected digital data storage costs are €284.6 × 0.5 × 3 = €426.90. These digital data storage costs are covered by lab funds. The expected costs to store 25 cryoboxes at -80°C is more difficult to assess, but will be borne by the host laboratory. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Digital data: Digital data: In the case of relatively small digital data, data will be preserved for longer than 5 years. The decision when to delete these data is made by prof. Roderick. For large digital datasets, such as raw microscopy images, unused datasets will be deleted. Raw sequencing and (methylation) microarray results are submitted to the NCBI SRA and deleted from our local storage after the 5 year period. To the researchgroup and the KUL, there are no storage costs associated with the SRA. Physical data / biological samples: Physical data / biological samples: Physical data stored at -80°C is costly, however beyond the 5 year period, such samples are stored until higher priority samples require the occupied space. These decisions are made by prof. Roderick. Physical data storage space at -20°C is much less costly but beyond the 5 year period, preservation or disposal of samples is similarly decided upon at the discretion of prof. Roderick. Physical data stored at RT (lab books) are stored until the retirement of prof. Roderick. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Digital datasets are stored on the KUL L drive (large volume shared network drive), and are moved to the KUL K drive (archive drive) as soon as possible. The K drive is write-once + read-only for researchers, i.e. data cannot be modified after being written. As these network drives are managed by the KUL ICTS, and backed up in 2 physical locations, storage of digital data on the K archive drive protects data from (accidental) loss, degredation, and change. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The current price of the L drive is €284,6/ 2.5 TB / year. The current price of the K drive is €142,3 / 2.5 TB / year. The expected costs to store the ~5 TB generated in this project for 5 years, given that the raw data will reside mainly on the K drive, the costs to store these data for 5 years is €142.30 × 2 × 5 = €1423. These digital data storage costs are covered by lab funds. The expected costs to store 25 cryoboxes at -80°C is more difficult to assess, but will be borne by the host laboratory. 5.
