The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Robin Lemmens. 0000-0002-4948-5956\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Anke Wouters investigator. 0000-0001-5229-2699\nAnnemie Devroye research nurse\nProject number 1 & title S70315\nFunder(s) GrantID 2TBM- T000325N\nAffiliation(s)  X KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

ICH survivors are at 7-19% annual risk\nof further major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, i.e. stroke [ischaemic or ICH], myocardial\ninfarction, or cardiovascular death [by ischaemia, bleeding or other vascular causes]).\nAim:\nWe seek definitive evidence for the superiority of antiplatelet monotherapy to prevent MACE for any\nICH survivor in five countries in a pragmatic, randomised, open-label, phase 3, international clinical\ntrial.\nPatients:\nASPIRING will recruit participants aged ≥18 years who have not started antiplatelet/anticoagulant\ntherapy after ICH in the UK (n=2,828), Canada (n=440), Australia (n=300), The Netherlands\n(n=356), and Belgium(n=240).\nIntervention:\nAntiplatelet monotherapy available in standard clinical practice (e.g. aspirin) without\nconcomitant therapeutic dose anticoagulation.\nComparator:\nAvoidance of antiplatelet therapy. Patients will be randomized by a secure, concealed, web-based\ncomputerised randomisation (with minimisation involving baseline prognostic factors) to allocate\nparticipants 1:1 to intervention or comparator.\nPrimary Outcome: MACE: \noHospitalisation due to any stroke\noHospitalisation due to myocardial infarction\noCardiovascular death (including deaths of unknown cause)\nImpact and dissemination: ASPIRING will provide level A evidence for guidelines.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.
