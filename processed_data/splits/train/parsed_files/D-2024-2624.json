A diet with established efficacy in IBS is the low Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Monosaccharides and Polyols (FODMAP)\ndiet. During my PhD, a blinded reintroduction phase identified individual FODMAP triggers and the efficacy of the diet in FD showed promising\nresults. The diet significantly reduced gastrointestinal symptoms, and this was associated with an improvement in duodenal mucosal permeability. In\naddition, our group observed improvement of FD symptoms and mucosal integrity with a 6-food elimination diet, which excludes the 6 main allergenic\nfood proteins. Based on these observations, we introduced confocal laser endomicroscopy, a novel technique that allows to assess immediate duodenal\nmucosal responses and identify triggering food proteins even though the patients lack circulating IgE antibodies to these nutrients. In this research\nproposal, we will advance our understanding of dietary factors as a trigger for symptoms and improve the ability to use an elimination diet as a\ntherapeutic approach in DGBI. We will conduct detailed interventional and mechanistic studies to assess the relationship between dietary intake,\nsymptom occurrence, duodenal mucosal alterations and gut peptide signaling. In addition, we will unravel the basis of the allergy-like duodenal\nmucosal responses to food proteins in FD.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n29-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
