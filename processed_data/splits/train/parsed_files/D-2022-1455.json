If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nOnly copyright restrictions on the published articles and books (secondary literature) that we will\nmake use of.\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nTo enable internal reuse of the data collected/generated in this project we will pay special\nattention to:\nbibliography management\nfile management, i.e., the practice of organizing files and folders in a consistent and\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 5\ndescriptive way to efficiently locate, identify and use our data in the form of the papers that\nwe have written ourselves\nbibliographical and non-biographical metadata for the papers that we have written\nourselves\n \nWith bibliography management we have the following in mind: we will collect all books and\narticles that are used (read, cited, referenced) in one BibTeX or Zotero master file, which will be\nstored on KU Leuvenâ€™s central network drives. The bibliographic entry types have required fields.\nFor example:\nrequired fields for articles: author, title, journal, volume, year\nrequired fields for books: author or editor, title, publisher, year\n \nWith file management we have the following in mind:\nwe will follow the best practice guidelines for file and folder names provided by \nKU Leuven\nLibraries (\nhttps://bib.kuleuven.be/english/research/research-\ndatamanagement/topics/organizing-files-and-folders\n) and, more specifically, \nwe will name the main folder as follows: FWO_SHORTPROJECTNAME, with\nSHORTPROJECTNAME the short name of the project without any special characters (most\nlikely: VERNACULAR), \nwe will name the subfolders as follows: TOPIC, with TOPIC a short description of the topic\nwithout any special characters,\nwe will organize the files according to topical relations (e.g., subtopic),\nwe will name files as follows: SHORTTITLE_YYYYMMDD_NM, with SHORTTITLE the short title\nof the paper without any special characters, YYYYMMDD the date of creation in the date\nformat with the year first, the month second and the day third, and NM the version number\nwith two decimals, ordered in the standard way (01,02, and so on).\n \nWith the provision of metadata we have the following in mind:\nall tex, docx, txt and rtf source files will contain at least the following bibliographical\nmetadata: title, author name(s), dates of the last revisions,\nall LaTeX source files (.tex) with references to other papers will be associated with a like-\nnamed bibliography file (.bbl) that contains bibliographical metadata for the references\nfound in the in paper.\n \nExternal reuse of the collected/generated data is facilitated by the following facts:\nall collected data (primary and secondary sources) are available online (e.g. through Google\nBooks, JStor, etc.)\nall generated data (cited and referenced articles, our own papers, the doctoral dissertation\nand so on) will be stored on Open Access archives\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nSee above for information about bibliographical metadata of the articles and books that we will\nuse and the bibliographical and non-biographical metadata for the articles that we will write\nourselves.\n \nMetadata in the form of bibliographical data will be available via the Open Access institutional\nrepository of KU Leuven (Lirias) and Open Access subject repositories (e.g., arXiv\n(\nhttps://arxiv.org/\n) and PhilArchive (\nhttps://philarchive.org/\n). The bibliographic metadata provided\non those platforms include:\ntitles,\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 5\nauthor names,\nauthor affiliations,\nfunding data,\npublication dates,\nissue numbers,\npage numbers and\nDOIs\nThe non-bibliographical metadata provided on those platforms include:\nabstracts,\nkeywords,\nreferences found in the paper and\ncitations of the paper.\n \n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nWe will store our data on KU Leuven's central network drives, which are safe, automatically\nbacked up, and capable of archiving large volumes of data. The supervisor and the co-supervisor\nwill keep the project folders on the central network drives for at least 5 years after the end of the\nresearch project. Joint work will also be stored on OneDrive for Business\n(\nhttps://admin.kuleuven.be/icts/english/services/onedrive\n). \nHow is backup of the data provided?\nWe will store our data on KU Leuven's central network drives with automatic daily back-up\nprocedures.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nYes. The estimated volume of generated data is clearly less than the 50 GB of space available to\nevery user of the network drives, and the 2TB of space available on each user's personal\nOneDrive account.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nNone. KU Leuven's central network drives as well as OneDrive for Business are freely available\nfor all KU Leuven researchers.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nData protection and security policies of KU Leuven apply to its central network drives and\nOneDrive for Business.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll data related to the project will be retained for at least 5 years after the end of the project. In\nparticular, this includes: \nthe primary sources that we have studied\nsecondary literature that we have used (read, cited, referenced),\nthe bibliographical metadata for the secondary literature that we have used,\nresearch notes, incl. minutes of meetings,\nthe database of textual fragments,\narticles that we have written during the course of the project,\nthe doctoral dissertation written by the project's PhD student.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 5\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nWe will archive our data on KU Leuven's central network drives, which are safe, automatically\nbacked up, and capable of archiving large volumes of data. The supervisor and the co-supervisor\nwill keep the project folders on the central network drives for at least 5 years after the end of the\nresearch project.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nStorage on the central network drives of KU Leuven is free of costs.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nNo\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nAll publications as well as the doctoral dissertation resulting from this research project will be\nadded to open access archives such as Lirias (\nhttps://lirias.kuleuven.be\n) and subject repositories,\ne.g., arXiv (\nhttps://arxiv.org/\n) and PhilArchive (\nhttps://philarchive.org/\n).
