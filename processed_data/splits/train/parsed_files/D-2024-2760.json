The state-of-the-art technologies are active cooling to provoke condensation of\nwater vapor and adsorption using desiccants. Active cooling is done by cooling below the dew point temperature causing supersaturation and\ncondensation. Its use is appropriate for treating high relative humidity air. Desiccant technologies are more popular because they allow for deeper\ndrying. The regeneration of conventional adsorbent needs to be done thermally at 150-250°C and is very energy demanding. Drying of air and\nindustrial gases is responsible for ca. 15% of the energy consumption in the chemical industry. We propose research into a much more energy efficient\ntechnology, expected to reduce the energy demand with 60%. Thermo-responsive desiccants are switching from hydrophilic to hydrophobic with\ntemperature. Water vapor is absorbed at low temperature and released in liquid form upon heating above the hydrophilicity switching temperature. This\ntemperature typically is around 40-80°C making it very attractive for using even waste heat for the regeneration step. This polymer technology has\nbeen developed in the biomedical field for drug delivery applications. Here an application in the chemical industry is proposed. The research focus will\nbe toward mastering the physico-chemical properties of the polymer to maximize water removal. We introduce a new concept of “osmocapillary”\ncondensation in a thermo-responsive polymer.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n05-02-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
