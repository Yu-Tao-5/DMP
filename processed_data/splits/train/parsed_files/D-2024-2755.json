The most dreaded consequence of a CA is a rupture, which causes a subarachnoid\nhemorrhage (SAH). This catastrophic occurrence is fatal in 26-50% of patients, where the surviving\npopulation is often left disabled.\nTreatment of CA can be either through an endovascular approach or surgically clipping the aneurysm,\nwhere to this day there are still raging debates on the best treatment modality for both ruptured and\neven more so for unruptured CA. Given the severe morbidity and mortality associated with an\naneurysmal SAH, further investigation is required for the preferred treatment choice for each\nindividual aneurysm since, to our knowledge there is no clear consensus-study which delineates a\ndecision-making tree or protocol for surgical clipping versus endovascular therapy for CA.\nKey objectives of the doctoral thesis:\nTo review the different evidence-based factors which advocate a clipping- or coiling based strategy\nand perform a study which includes artificial intelligence to aid decision-making.\nDeveloping a 3D model which can simulate the aneurysm clipping in each individual case, which can\nbe used as a teaching tool for aneurysm clipping, and to identify and anticipate different pitfalls\nwhich might occur during surgery.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n18-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
