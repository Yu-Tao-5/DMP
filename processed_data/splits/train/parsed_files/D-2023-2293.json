ECMs have\nreceived considerable attention in recent decades due to their wide range of applications in displays, signage, smart-\nboards, and energy-saving smart windows. There are several inorganic and organic ECMs that change their optical\nproperties such as transparency and colour upon changing their oxidation state. Organic materials have emerged as\npromising candidates because they offer higher coloration efficiencies, better tunability and faster switching times than\ntheir inorganic counterparts. However, the application of popular organic ECM materials is still hampered by issues with\ntheir cyclic stability, durability, and uniform color performance. Given the practical demands of flexible nanoelectronic\ndevices built on stretchable substrates, robust ultrathin (monolayer thick) and flexible ECMs with higher coloration\nefficiencies, faster switching times and higher durability are the need of the hour. In this regard, fabrication of materials\nwith highly ordered/ patterned nanostructures could provide an oriented interface with the electrolyte, thereby\nenhancing the electron transfer rate, factors that are crucial for realizing a quick and efficient electrochromic switching.\nbe carried out in synergy to explore ordering phenomena and chiral selectivity processes from first principles and reach\na fundamental understanding beyond specific systems.\nLast modified: \n03-08-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

As a consequence, we have created our own file format that fits to our experimental data. Although most of the\ngenerated data files contain metadata specific for that experiment, this is not sufficient and we will supplement this information with a detailed text document (ASCII type)\nstoring the necessary information for finding, understanding and reuse of data. The text file will be placed in every folder containing data or processed data. In the case of\nprocessed or analysed data, detailed descriptions on the analysis steps will also be included. The text file and the structure of the folders used to deposit data will have a\nstandard format. This will allow other users to: repeat the experiments or find and retrieve data.\n \n3.

How will these costs be covered?\nKUL: Standard every user has 2 TB on University's central network drive (OneDrive). This capacity can be extended to 5 TB without costs.\n \n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the\nproject? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues,\ninstitutional policies...).\nKULeuven: Physical data in the form of samples will be retained for 5 years. Most samples will degrade with time and will not be usable after 5 years. Digital data will be\nretained for 10 years.\n \nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nKULeuven: Samples will be stored for 5 years in dedicated cabinets in the laboratories. Digital data will be retained for 10 years on local data storage facilities.\n \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nCosts are expected to be negligible and will be covered by other running projects from the involved groups (in case of no running projects, accumulated reserves will be\nused).\n5.
