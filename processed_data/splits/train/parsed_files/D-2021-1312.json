HAs require tuning in to optimize speech understanding and achieve satisfactory\nhearing outcomes for the user in daily life. The tuning process involves the use of speech\nintelligibility measurements to assess hearing outcomes; however, current methods of measuring\nspeech intelligibility do not adequately address real-life scenarios. We propose to develop a more\nrealistic measurement of speech intelligibility through the combination of two recently published\nmethods. The first concept is the objective measure of speech intelligibility (OMSI), which is\nbased on electroencephalography (EEG) recorded brain responses to speech. The second\nconcept is the Audiovisual True-to-life Assessment of Auditory Rehabilitation (AVATAR), which is a\nvirtual reality approach used to immerse a person in a realistic environment while measuring\ntheir speech intelligibility behaviorally. We have coined the combination of these two concepts as\nthe audiovisual, realistic, and objective measurement for the intelligibility of speech (ARTOMIS).\nWe will develop and evaluate the ARTOMIS with the goals of (1) showing ecological validity of the\nmeasure in both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners and (2) clinical translation of the\nARTOMIS setup. The application of ARTOMIS should lead to improved hearing outcomes with HAs.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nReuse existing data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 5\nType of\ndata\nFormat\nVolume\nHow created\nPersonal\ndata\n(digital and\nnon-digital)\n.pdf, .readme\nfiles,\nspreadsheets\n1 GB\nBasic information is\ngathered by\nquestionnaires (name,\nage, sex, mother\ntongue, relevant\nmedical history e.g.\nhistory of ear\ninfections, brain\nconcussion).

Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nYes\nPrivacy Registry Reference: G-2021-4327\nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used: \nname, age, sex, mother tongue,\nrelevant medical history e.g. history of ear infections, brain concussion\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nYes\nReference to the formal approval by the ethical review committee: S57102\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 5\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\nNot at the moment. In case there arises IP possibilities, we will contact LRD.\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nNew lab members recieve training on how to perform the experiments as well as how and where\nto store and \nhandle the collected data. Furthermore, standard guidelines and instructions are\navailable as .pdf\nand .readme files that are stored on network drive. These files contain best practices regarding\nthe practical side \nof the experiments (set-up, parameters,...) as well as policies about how to\ntreat the subjects, \nhow to handle and where to keep sensitive information, etc. In this way, the\ninformation given \nduring the training can easily be re-read and refreshed. \nThese guidelines, in\ncombination with the fact that the original collected data are stored on backed-up \ndrives in a\nstandard format (BIDS, see also website bids.neuroimaging.io), should make it \npossible to\nunderstand and reuse the data.\nThe code corresponding to each result will be stored on a git repository so that reusers will be\nable to recreate the results. The commentary lines in the code also document how the data is\norganized and how a result can be obtained. To accomplish this, we will use regular code and\ncomments as well as \nJupyter notebooks. The code also contains an implicit description of how\nthe \ncollected data is organized, it can be used as an explanation of the data.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nYes\nThe data will be stored based on the BIDS structure, which is an organizational structure for\nneuroimaging\nand behavioral data (see also website bids.neuroimaging.io). The BIDS format is a \nway to\nstructure your data / metadata within a hierarchy of folders. This makes it easy to browse\nfrom a computer, as well as to automatically parse a BIDS folder with a program. The BIDS\nstructure makes minimal assumptions about the tools needed to interact with the data that's\ninside.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nThe data will be stored on KU Leuven administered drives (large volume storage and OneDrive).\nIn order to be able to analyse the data, some files will need (temporarily) to be stored on the\nencrypted PC hard drive (this since calculations from a non-local source are too slow and lead to\ncomputational failures). Once analysed, the raw data are again removed from the local hard\ndrive.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nSince the data are stored on KU Leuven storage, the general ICT back-up Policy is applied.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nYes. Since the data are stored on KU Leuven servers, and these drives are expandable in blocks,\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 5\nthe backup capacity will not be an issue.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nThe OneDrive (including version history) has sufficient capacity and is available without any\ncosts.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nThe lab policy is that the researchers have only access to the data from the project they are\ninvolved in. Furthermore, the data for longer term storage are kept on separate drives with 1)\nlimited access (only a limited set of people have access) and 2) an overwrite and delete\nprotection (based on read-write access) in order to prevent accidental loss of these data.\nProf. Francart is the only person who has access to the key information for identification of the\nsubjects. His back-up persons (only to be used in extreme case) are Jan\n \nWouters and Astrid van\nWieringen \n(both PIâ€™s within the lab).\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll data.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nOn OneDrive, as this data storage is still accessible by the promotor if the researcher has left the\nlab it can be considered long term storage.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nNone, as OneDrive is not paid by the researcher.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nYes. Specify:\nThe informed consent contains a section in which the participant can chooses his/her data is\nshared.

Furthermore shared data will always be pseudonymised.\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nAt this moment, no data will be made available at the end of the project.
