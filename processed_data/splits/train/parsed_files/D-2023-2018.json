The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan.

While \nimmune-checkpoint blockers (ICBs) have revolutionized the oncology field, there is still a large subset of \npatients that do not respond to ICBs, a disparity that is well captured in CRC. CRC has two subtypes with \nopposing ICB-responses: microsatellite instable (MSI; highly responsive to anti-PD1 ICBs) vs. microsatellite \nstable (MSS; resistant to anti-PD1 ICBs). Surprisingly, a recent clinical trial showed that anti-CTLA4+anti-\nPD1 ICB induces positive responses in MSS-CRC. While linked to increased tumoral T cell/myeloid \ninfiltrates, these responses couldn’t be distinguished by CTLA4 relevant T cell biomarkers, raising the \nquestion: could CTLA4 have unknown myeloid immunomodulatory functions, accounting for this success? \nIn this project we will combine clinical immunogenomics with state-of-the-art experimental techniques \nand novel CRC mouse models, together with various novel immunotherapy approaches, to \ncomprehensively delineate novel immunomodulatory functions of CTLA4 on the level of myeloid cells, \nwhich may be playing an important role in CRC tumour immunology. Our project may lead to novel \nimmunology concepts and novel myeloid-based biomarkers to inform patient selection for, and improve, \nCTLA4-modulatory immunotherapy for efficient CRC treatment.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

Those notes will describe the biological \nsamples used/generated, experimental setup and protocols used, results generated, the links to the \nspecific computer location as well as the names of the respective datasets. We will also maintain a \nmetadata sheet with the connection between lab samples and files on our data storage, so that data files, \nlab samples, and experimental notes remain properly linked. Detailed protocols will be written, including \nresearch methods and practices for each experimental initiative. This will be stored in Word or Excel files. \nFurthermore, a logbook will be kept in Excel containing all steps that were taken to develop the final \nmethodology, date of implementation and name of the researcher who carried out the experiment. \nAlgorithms, scripts and software usage will be documented and stored alongside the electronic laboratory \nrecords, e.g. GraphPad Prism, FlowJo. Finally, we will also keep all the information (in dedicated Excel \nsheets, PDFs or Word-files) about purchased antibodies, cell-lines, mouse models and other analogue \ndata-sources. Other relevant information about these reagents and tools (e.g., proof of antibody \nspecificity) will be derived from initial standardization and optimization experiments and will be retained \nalong with general research documentation/meta-data files.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9Will a metadata standard be used to make it \neasier to find and reuse the data ? \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard \nwill be used.

For instance, flow cytometry (https://flowrepository.org/),  \nmicroscopy imaging (https://www.openmicroscopy.org/), qRT-PCR (http://miqe.gene-quantification.info/),  \nand publicly available TCGA patient data analyses (https://gdc.cancer.gov/aboutdata/ data-standards) have  \nvery well-defined pre-established meta-data standards. In case we do not have a metadata standard  \navailable for a technique/datatype, a metadata of the numerical datasets will be created manually (e.g.  \nbased on the Dublin core metadata standard). For most of the data, metadata will be provided as readme,  \nword or excel files, containing all settings and technical descriptions of the experiment and data. In parallel,  \ndetailed meta-data info will be integrated within the electronic laboratory records linked to each experiment  \n(as described above)\nIf no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created:  \n4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project\nWhere will the data be stored? Digital files will be stored on KU Leuven data storage servers. All data generated during the project will be \nstored on the local KU Leuven servers, PI computers, and backup hard drives, as well as on a local RAID \nstorage available in the office. This will be initially located in the real-time folders (on lab provided \nlaptops/PCs of the students or employees and local KU Leuven servers) and later only in the archive \nfolders (archive is mirrored; on local KU Leuven servers, backup hard-drives as well as PI computers). Any \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10algorithms, scripts or softwares originally generated during the project will be stored in private online git \nrepositories of the PIs. As soon as the manuscript is publicly available, the repository will be changed to a \npublic repository. Specific biological samples (e.g. cell lysates, protein/nucleic acid samples) will be stored \nin a freezer (-20°C or -80°C) while cell lines will be stored in liquid nitrogen.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nWHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO \nPREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA \nAND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP \nDIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7\nREFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP \nPROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.Digital data will be stored on the university’s secure network drives with automatic daily back-up \nprocedures (e.g. JDrive for confidential data and KUL Enterprise Box for non-confidential data. Data is also \nstored as a backup on lab computers, external hard drives, and on a local RAID 50 system in the office.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.☒ Yes\n☐ No\nIf yes, please specify concisely: Yes, in the various KUL storage services, as well as the 36Tb local RAID 50 \nsystem present in the office.\nIf no, please specify:  \nHow will you ensure that the data are securely \nstored and not accessed or modified by \nunauthorized persons?\nCLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, \nNETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND \nFILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND \nTRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7The “J-drive” and “KUL Enterprise Box” servers are accessible only by laboratory members and PIs. Local \nstorage systems like the RAID system and external hard drives are not accessible remotely and password \nprotected. \n7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric:  https://osf.io/2z5g3/\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11What are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?The total estimated cost of data storage during the project is 500 EUR. This estimation is based on the \nfollowing costs: - The costs of digital data storage are as follows: approximately 52 EUR/100 GB/Year for \nthe “J-drive” and approximately 10 EUR/100 GB/Year for the “KUL Enterprise Box”.  \n5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five \nyears (or longer, in agreement with other \nretention policies that are applicable) after the \nend of the project? In case some data cannot be  \npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this  \n(e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, institutional policies...).The minimum preservation term of 10 years after the end of the project will be applied to all relevant \ndata. Cell lines will also be stored for at least or more than 10 years. Cell lysates and certain biological \nsamples will be stored for at least 5 years (beyond 5 years, the degradation of these samples makes their \nstorage “useless” and would require repeating the experiments to re-generate the data).  \nWhere will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long-term)?Data will be stored as described in section 4, as well as archived using KU Leuven’s long term storage/large  \nvolume storage service.\nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during the expected retention \nperiod? How will these costs be covered?KU Leuven long term storage/large volume storage should cost around 100€/TB/year. The total volume of \nrelevant data to be stored is expected to be significantly under that. The costs for archival data will be paid  \nupfront from the FWO project funds.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 126. Data Sharing and Reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made \navailable for reuse after/during the project?  \nPlease explain per dataset or data type which \ndata will be made available.  \nNOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE \nDATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS \nAND USE MAY APPLY.

If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3.Documentation and Metadata FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 8Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded).Documentation will consist of electronic laboratory records, that contain all of the information of the performed experiment itself (Excel sheetbased metadata files). Those notes will describe the biological samples used/generated, experimental setup and protocols used, results generated, the links to the specific computer location as well as the names of the respective datasets. We will also maintain a metadata sheet with the connection between lab samples and files on our data storage, so that data files, lab samples, and experimental notes remain properly linked. Detailed protocols will be written, including research methods and practices for each experimental initiative. This will be stored in Word or Excel files. Furthermore, a logbook will be kept in Excel containing all steps that were taken to develop the final methodology, date of implementation and name of the researcher who carried out the experiment. Algorithms, scripts and software usage will be documented and stored alongside the electronic laboratory records, e.g. GraphPad Prism, FlowJo. Finally, we will also keep all the information (in dedicated Excel sheets, PDFs or Word-files) about purchased antibodies, cell-lines, mouse models and other analogue data-sources. Other relevant information about these reagents and tools (e.g., proof of antibody specificity) will be derived from initial standardization and optimization experiments and will be retained along with general research documentation/meta-data files. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: We will use various metadata standards as applicable for different experiment/datatypes, as already established elsewhere: https://fairsharing.org/. For instance, flow cytometry (https://flowrepository.org/), microscopy imaging (https://www.openmicroscopy.org/), qRT-PCR (http://miqe.gene-quantification.info/), and publicly available TCGA patient data analyses (https://gdc.cancer.gov/aboutdata/ data-standards) have very well-defined pre-established meta-data standards. In case we do not have a metadata standard available for a technique/datatype, a metadata of the numerical datasets will be created manually (e.g. based on the Dublin core metadata standard). For most of the data, metadata will be provided as readme, word or excel files, containing all settings and technical descriptions of the experiment and data. In parallel, detailed meta-data info will be integrated within the electronic laboratory records linked to each experiment (as described above) If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Digital files will be stored on KU Leuven data storage servers. All data generated during the project will be stored on the local KU Leuven servers, PI computers, and backup hard drives, as well as on a local RAID storage available in the office. This will be initially located in the real-time folders (on lab provided laptops/PCs of the students or employees and local KU Leuven servers) and later only in the archive folders (archive is mirrored; on local KU Leuven servers, backup hard-drives as well as PI computers). Any FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10algorithms, scripts or softwares originally generated during the project will be stored in private online git repositories of the PIs. As soon as the manuscript is publicly available, the repository will be changed to a public repository. Specific biological samples (e.g. cell lysates, protein/nucleic acid samples) will be stored in a freezer (-20°C or -80°C) while cell lines will be stored in liquid nitrogen. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.Digital data will be stored on the university’s secure network drives with automatic daily back-up procedures (e.g. JDrive for confidential data and KUL Enterprise Box for non-confidential data. Data is also stored as a backup on lab computers, external hard drives, and on a local RAID 50 system in the office. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: Yes, in the various KUL storage services, as well as the 36Tb local RAID 50 system present in the office. If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7The “J-drive” and “KUL Enterprise Box” servers are accessible only by laboratory members and PIs. Local storage systems like the RAID system and external hard drives are not accessible remotely and password protected. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?The total estimated cost of data storage during the project is 500 EUR. This estimation is based on the following costs: - The costs of digital data storage are as follows: approximately 52 EUR/100 GB/Year for the “J-drive” and approximately 10 EUR/100 GB/Year for the “KUL Enterprise Box”. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).The minimum preservation term of 10 years after the end of the project will be applied to all relevant data. Cell lines will also be stored for at least or more than 10 years. Cell lysates and certain biological samples will be stored for at least 5 years (beyond 5 years, the degradation of these samples makes their storage “useless” and would require repeating the experiments to re-generate the data). Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?Data will be stored as described in section 4, as well as archived using KU Leuven’s long term storage/large volume storage service. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?KU Leuven long term storage/large volume storage should cost around 100€/TB/year. The total volume of relevant data to be stored is expected to be significantly under that. The costs for archival data will be paid upfront from the FWO project funds. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 126. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY.
