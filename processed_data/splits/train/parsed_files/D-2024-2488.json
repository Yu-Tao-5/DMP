The key ingredient for most state-of-the-art computer-\nassisted graph theory (CAGT) approaches consists of carefully designed algorithms that are capable of generating all graphs of a given class while\navoiding redundant isomorphic copies. The strategic goal of this research proposal is to extend and complement CAGT techniques with a rich toolbox\nof operations research (OR) algorithms. To demonstrate the potential of this integrated CAGT-OR approach, a number of important open problems in\ngraph theory for which such an approach seems promising will be tackled. These problems can be subdivided into three distinct research lines.\nThe first research line concerns problems on cycles that contain all fixed-size vertex subsets of a given graph. The aim is to answer questions about the\nlargest such subsets and to investigate questions in which an additional constraint is imposed on cycles so that certain fixed-size vertex subsets are\nforbidden.\nThe second research line revolves around the average order of connected induced subgraphs of simple graphs and three important subclasses, namely\ncubic graphs, trees and graphs with minimum vertex degree three.\nThe third and final research line aims to improve the currently best lower and upper bounds on the order of cages (the smallest regular graphs with a\ngiven girth) and edge-girth-regular graphs (a closely related extension).\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n12-01-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
