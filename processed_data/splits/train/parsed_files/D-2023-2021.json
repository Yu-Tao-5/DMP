The DMP should not be submitted to FWO \nbut to the research co -ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel.  Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.  \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation  Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives  of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions.

If so, please d escribe these issues further and refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. ☒ Yes, human subjec t data ☐ Yes, animal data ☐ Yes, dual use ☐ No During diffe rent studies, human participants will be involved and human subject data will be gathered. Before we start with each study, we will complete the PRET questionnaire about GDPR and data handling. Furthermore, we will apply for ethical committee approval if needed. All data will be stored on the online secured, safe platform of KU Leuven, Sharepoint. Only the researchers involved in a study (dependent on each study, these can be different) will get access to the study documents on the Sharepoint. In each proto col that we will submit to the ethical committee, we will mention which researcher(s) will get access to the study documents on the Sharepoint. As such, we will also have ethical committee approval for sharing our research/personal data with certain resear chers. Furthermore, informed consent will always be gathered of participants before collecting personal data. This data will further be handled as also indicated in the informed consent form. Personal data will minimally be pseudonomized. If possible, we w ill always make the data files anonymous. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10 Will you process personal data6?

Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12 Where will the data be stored? During and after the research, all data will be stored on the online secured, safe platform of KU Leuven, Sharepoint. This platform has enough storage to keep all the data that will be gathered during this PhD project. A backup will be stored on the KU Leuven internal server. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS , STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON -DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH .7 REFER TO INSTITUTION -SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE . A backup will be stored on the KU Leuven internal server. Backup occurs automatically, as the folders are synched. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concise ly: The storage of Sharepoint is 5GB, but this is expendable in blocks of 5GB. Only small datasets will be gathered during this project. However, if ne eded, Sharepoint can be expended, ensuring me that enough space is available to collect alle the data. If no, please specify : 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13 How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . 7 During the project's data collection phase (i.e. before data is made open) all data is stored on a secure, 2 factor authentication pr otected KU Leven One Drive server. namely Sharepoint. Backup copes are made on the KU Leuven internal server, which is also password protected. Backup occurs automatically, as the folders are synched. The Excel file that contains the names and contact deta ils of all (potential) interviewees is further protected with a password. What are the exp ected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? As only small datasets will be generated that can be stored (now and after the end of the project) on the online, free of charge platform of KU Leuven, Sharepoint, there will be no costs related to data sto rage. If deemed needed, extra storage can be bought (5GB for 39,80 euro), which can be paid from the FWO bench fee. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research P roject Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). All obtained/generated databases will be stored in accordance to the ethical clearance obtained from the ethical committee of UZ Leuven , there are no restrictions . Only recordings of participants in qualitative research will be deleted upon transcription t his in accordance with ethical guidelines. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14 Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? On a secured KUL server, only accessible to researchers involved in this project. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? No expected additional costs. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 15 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available.

All datasets that do not contain personal information can be made available after publication. Reuse of datasets will be limited as all results will first be published and secondary analysis are not possible. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Restrictions to data access will be made as I am working with personal data. Only researchers with in the KU Leuven/UZ Leuven involved in a specific study that need to have access to certain files will get permissions. This will be clearly indicated in the PRET and EC application. If researchers outside the KU Leuven/UZ Leuven want to have access to the files with personal data, a data sharing agreement wil be made by LRD. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 16 Are there any factors that restrict o r prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?

Before we start with each study, we will complete the PRET questionnaire about GDPR and data handling. Furthermore, we will apply for ethical committee approval if needed. All data will be stored on the online secured, safe platform of KU Leuven, Sharepoint. Only the researchers involved in a study (dependent on each study, these can be different) will get access to the study documents on the Sharepoint. In each protocol that we will submit to the ethical committee, we will m ention which researcher(s) will get access to the study documents on the Sharepoint. As such, we will also have ethical committee approval for sharing our research/personal data with certain researchers. If possible, data will be made anonymous. However, f or interviews, this will not be possible, and data will be pseudonymized. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. Data will be deposited in the KU Leuven's Research Data Repository. This means that it will remain accessible after the life of the project, even after my own association with KU Leuven ends. All documentation and publi shed results will be available through Lirias, the KU Leuven repository. Lirias also provides a gateway to materials stored on the Research Data Repository. I have investigated the conditions for use of the KU Leuven research Data Repository and an satisfi ed that it is suitable for this project.
