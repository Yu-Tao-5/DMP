The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Xiaojuan YANG\nORCID: 0000-0002-7534-011X\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Wim Annaert, supervisor\nORCID: 0000-0003-0150-9661\nProject number1 & title Unraveling the unprecedented roles for Presenilin/γ-secretase in inter-organellar membrane contact \nsites and how this modulates cellular calcium homeostasis\nFunder(s) GrantID212E0123N\nAffiliation(s) ☒ KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nProvide ROR3 identifier when possible:  \n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

Nevertheless, mutant PSENs have also been extensively linked to Ca2+  \nsignaling pathways, for instance through storage compartments, like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and  \nlysosomes. Ca2+ shuttling from these compartments is to a large extent organized through membrane  \ncontact sites (MCSs) with other organelles, e.g. ER-plasma membrane (PM) and ER-lysosome MCSs. How  \nFAD-associated mutant PSENs modulate these MCSs is a largely uncharted territory. The host lab has  \ndemonstrated that PSEN1 and PSEN2 differ majorly in their sub-cellular locations, with PSEN1 broadly  \ndistributed at the PM and endosomes while PSEN2 is restricted to late endosomes/lysosomes (LE/Lys).  \nPreliminary evidence from the host lab underscores that this distinct spatial distribution may reflect a  \nselective involvement of the different PSENs in the compartment-specific Ca2+ handling. In this proposal, I  \nwill investigate the expression and function of the two PSENs at the respective MCSs, combining advanced  \nbiochemical and imaging strategies, unraveling their role in Ca2+ signaling through MCSs. I will extend this to  \nFAD-associated  mutations  in  PSENs,  as  this  may  provide  novel  mechanistic  insights  into  the  Ca2+  \ndysregulation observed in the patho-ethiology of AD.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

Results will be published in accordance with ethical guidelines set by the \nInternational Committee of Medical Journal Editors. Existing agreements between VIB and KU Leuven do \nnot restrict publication of data. We do not exclude that the proposed work could result in research data \nwith potential for tech transfer and valorization. VIB has a policy to actively monitor research data for such  \npotential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of \ncases the invention will be IP protected (mostly patent protection or copyright protection). As such, the IP \nprotection does not withhold the research data from being made public. In the case a decision is taken to \nfile a patent application, it will be planned so that publications are not delayed.  \nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict \nexploitation or dissemination of the data you \n(re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements,  \nresearch collaboration agreements)?  \nIf so, please explain to what data they relate and  \nwhat restrictions are in place.☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes, please explain:  \n6 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9Are there any other legal issues, such as \nintellectual property rights and ownership, to be  \nmanaged related to the data you (re)use?  \nIf so, please explain to what data they relate and  \nwhich restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes, please explain:  \n3.Documentation and Metadata\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10Clearly describe what approach will be followed  \nto  capture  the  accompanying  information  \nnecessary  to  keep  data  understandable  and  \nusable, for yourself and others, now and in the  \nfuture (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and  \ntypes required, procedures used, Electronic Lab  \nNotebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc.  \nwhere this information is recorded).Digital data will be stored on KU Leuven servers and will be made available together with the accompanying\nmetadata at the latest at the time of publication. The principle of preservation of data and the minimum  \npreservation term of 10 years after the end of the project will be applied without restriction to raw data as  \nwell as processed data. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, potential  \nIP requirements or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be made  \npublicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached.\nAs detailed below, metadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse,  \nand will be conform to community norms. Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will  \nbe made publicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. These repositories clearly  \ndescribe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public  \nDomain Dedication or an ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement  \nwhen applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit  \nto the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. In this regard, plasmids can be submitted to  \nAddgene (https://www.addgene.org/depositing/start-deposit/).  For  data  shared  directly  by  the  PI,  a  \nmaterial transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the  \nbeneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted.\nBefore the start of an experiment, suitable metadata standards will be checked at FAIRsharing; using  \nstandards as the Minimal Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations (MIBBI) and OME-TIFF for  \nimages. The latter is used by the OMERO platform (see section 6). In particular, the following data sets will be  \nstored:\nDerived and compiled data\nDataset 2.1 – Research documentation\nResearch documentation generated or collected from online sources (e.g. pubmed) and from collaborators,  \nincluding publications, tutorials, laboratory notes, protocols, animal husbandry data.\nData formats: \n-Text files: Rich Text Format (.rtf), plain text data (Unicode, .txt), MS Word (.doc/.docx), eXtensible Mark-up  \nLanguage (.xml), Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf), LaTex (.tex) format .\nEstimated yearly storage : 10 MB. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11Dataset 2.2 – Manuscripts\nIncludes text files, illustrations and figures derived and compiled from experimental data.\nData formats: \n-Text files: Rich Text Format (.rtf), plain text data (Unicode, .txt), MS Word (.doc/.docx), eXtensible Mark-\nup Language (.xml), Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf), LaTex (.tex) format;\n-Quantitative tabular data: comma-separated value files (.csv), tab-delimited file (.tab), delimited text  \n(.txt), MS Excel (.xls/.xlsx), MS Access (.mdb/.accdb);\n-Digital images in raster formats: uncompressed TIFF (.tif/.tiff), JPEG (.jpg), JPEG 2000 (.jp2), Adobe  \nPortable Document Format (.pdf), bitmap (.bmp), .gif;\n-Digital images in vector formats: scalable vector graphics (.svg), encapsulated postscript (.eps), Scalable  \nVector Graphics (.svg), Adobe Illustrator (.ai);\n-Digital video data: MPEG-4 High Profile (.mp4), motion JPEG 2000 (.mjp2), Audio Video Interleave (.avi) .\nEstimated yearly storage : 150 MB.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12Will a metadata standard be used to make it \neasier to find and reuse the data ? \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard \nwill be used. If not, please specify which \nmetadata will be created to make the data \neasier to find and reuse.\nREPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN \nFORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. \nSTANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes\n☐ No\nIf yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: \nIf no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created:  \n \nMetadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis,  \nby taking careful notes that refer to specific datasets.  While specific data types might require particular  \nmetadata, as a general rule the metadata will be based on a generalized metadata schema such as Dublin  \nCore or DataCite, including the following elements:\n• Title: free text\n• Creator: Last name, first name, organization\n• Date and time reference\n• Subject: Choice of keywords and classifications\n• Description: Text explaining the content of the data set and other contextual information needed for the  \ncorrect interpretation of the data, the software(s) (including version number) used to produce and to read  \nthe data, the purpose of the experiment, etc.\n• Format: Details of the file format,\n• Resource Type: data set, image, audio, etc.\n• Identifier: DOI (when applicable)\n• Access rights: closed access, embargoed access, restricted access, open access.\nFor specific datasets, additional metadata will be associated with the data file as appropriate. The final \ndataset as deposited in the chosen data repository will be accompanied by this information under the \nform of a README.txt document. This file will be located in the top level directory of the dataset and will \nalso list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used. This will allow the data  \nto be understood by other members of the laboratory/scientific community and add contextual value to \nthe dataset for future reuse.\n4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13Where will the data be stored? As a rule, digital data will be stored on KU Leuven servers. \nAll omics data generated during the project will be stored on KU Leuven servers or, for larger datasets, on \nThe Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC) in the staging area, at first. Upon publication, all omics data \nsupporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via open access repositories such as the PRIDE \nArchive for proteomics data, the EMBL-EBI platform for genomics and epigenomics data, and the LIPID \nMAPS Lipidomics Gateway for lipidomics data.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nWHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO \nPREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA \nAND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP \nDIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7\nREFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP \nPROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.The operating system of the KU  Leuven vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of  \nupgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound  \nby the ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. Stored data is backed up using \nsnapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. As \nstandard, 10% of the requested storage is reserved for backups using the following backup regime: an \nhourly backup (at 8 a.m., 12 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.), the last 6 of which are kept; a daily backup (every \nday) at midnight, the last 6 of which are kept; and a weekly backup (every week) at midnight between \nSaturday and Sunday, the last 2 of which are kept. A security service monitors the technical installations \ncontinuously, even outside working hours.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.☒ Yes\n☐ No\nIf yes, please specify concisely:\nWe give preference to the use of robust, managed storage with automatic backup. Options include central  \nstorage facilities of the research unit, the group or KU Leuven, or a cloud service offered by KU Leuven, all \nof which have sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project.\nIf no, please specify:  \n7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric:  https://osf.io/2z5g3/\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14How will you ensure that the data are securely \nstored and not accessed or modified by \nunauthorized persons?\nCLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, \nNETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND \nFILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND \nTRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7For  the data produced in this project, we will abide by the Belgian law on the General Data Protection  \nRegulation 2016/679. The Privacy Team of KU Leuven will be notified before the start of the project research  \nstarts and the Data Stewart will therefore:\n- designate the categories of persons who have access to the sensitive data, with a precise description of  \ntheir capacity in relation to the processing of these data;\n- keep the list of the designated categories of persons at the disposal of the competent supervisory authority  \n(Data Protection Authority);\n- ensure that the designated persons are obliged by a legal or statutory obligation, or by an equivalent \ncontractual provision, to observe the confidential nature of the data concerned.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?It is the intention to minimize data sharing costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata  \ncollection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-use data  \nrepositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Unless mentioned otherwise, data management  \ncosts will be covered by the laboratory budget. \nAll digital files\nDigital files will be stored on KU Leuven servers:\n-the “L-drive” costs 173,78€/TB/Year. This server is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel  \nFile System (GPFS) cluster with NetApp eseries storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front-\nend. Stored data is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect  \nof the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept.  \n-The “J-drive” costs 519€/TB/Year. This server is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controllers with an \nOntap  9.1P9  operating  system.  Stored  data  is  backed  up  using  snapshot  technology  where  all  \nincremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. Backups are performed hourly,  \ndaily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the  \nlast 6 backups are kept. \nBoth servers are accessible only by laboratory members, and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for  \nbusiness continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. We will  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 15use free-to-use repositories to share digital files, so that there will be no additional cost required to make the  \ndata open access. \nVectors\nAll published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the non-profit plasmid repository  \nAddgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request. The associated costs are thus  \nminimal (only shipment costs). All other vectors generated during the project will be shared with researchers  \nupon request (handling by the technical staff of the laboratory, shipping costs supported by the receiver).\nManagement of the vector collection is under the responsibility of the PI and the lab manager. Long-term  \npreservation of this collection is of extremely high value for the laboratory, and as a general rule at least two  \nindependently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in  \n-20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock (-80°C). These will be stored for the remainder of the PI’s  \nresearch career.  Note that all DNA sequences derived from human subjects will be de-identified.\n5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five \nyears (or longer, in agreement with other \nretention policies that are applicable) after the \nend of the project? In case some data cannot be  \npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this  \n(e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, institutional policies...).The data will be stored for a minimum of 10 years, i.e. at least 5 years after the end of the project. After \nthis period, the PI will regularly evaluate whether retention of the data is still necessary and, if applicable, \ndelete data.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 16Where will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long-term)?Images will be archived using the OMERO platform.\nUpon publication, all omics data supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available (and archived) via  \nopen access repositories such as the PRIDE Archive for proteomics data, the EMBL-EBI platform for \ngenomics and epigenomics data and the LIPID MAPS Lipidomics Gateway for lipidomics data.\nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during the expected retention \nperiod? How will these costs be covered?Similarly to the data management costs during the project, data preservation after the end of the FWO \nproject will be covered by the laboratory budget.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 176. Data Sharing and Reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made \navailable for reuse after/during the project?  \nPlease explain per dataset or data type which \ndata will be made available.  \nNOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE \nDATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS \nAND USE MAY APPLY.

In those cases, datasets will be made publicly available as \nsoon as the embargo date is reached.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 18Which data usage licenses are you going to \nprovide? If none, please explain why.\nA DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE \nREUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS \nGRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY \nREUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A \nLICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER \nANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT.\nEXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE \nSHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS \nATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE \nCREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8  Datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories that support \nFAIR data sharing.

    "clean_full_text": "FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 1FWO DMP Template - Flemish Standard Data Management Plan Project supervisors (from application round 2018 onwards) and fellows (from application round 2020 onwards) will, upon being awarded their project or fellowship, be invited to develop their answers to the data management related questions into a DMP. The FWO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.

Since their discovery, many teams have focused on how these mutations affect PSEN’s catalytic role in producing toxic amyloid β peptides. Nevertheless, mutant PSENs have also been extensively linked to Ca2+ signaling pathways, for instance through storage compartments, like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysosomes. Ca2+ shuttling from these compartments is to a large extent organized through membrane contact sites (MCSs) with other organelles, e.g. ER-plasma membrane (PM) and ER-lysosome MCSs. How FAD-associated mutant PSENs modulate these MCSs is a largely uncharted territory. The host lab has demonstrated that PSEN1 and PSEN2 differ majorly in their sub-cellular locations, with PSEN1 broadly distributed at the PM and endosomes while PSEN2 is restricted to late endosomes/lysosomes (LE/Lys). Preliminary evidence from the host lab underscores that this distinct spatial distribution may reflect a selective involvement of the different PSENs in the compartment-specific Ca2+ handling. In this proposal, I will investigate the expression and function of the two PSENs at the respective MCSs, combining advanced biochemical and imaging strategies, unraveling their role in Ca2+ signaling through MCSs. I will extend this to FAD-associated mutations in PSENs, as this may provide novel mechanistic insights into the Ca2+ dysregulation observed in the patho-ethiology of AD.

Results will be published in accordance with ethical guidelines set by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. Existing agreements between VIB and KU Leuven do not restrict publication of data. We do not exclude that the proposed work could result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorization. VIB has a policy to actively monitor research data for such potential. If there is substantial potential, the invention will be thoroughly assessed, and in a number of cases the invention will be IP protected (mostly patent protection or copyright protection). As such, the IP protection does not withhold the research data from being made public. In the case a decision is taken to file a patent application, it will be planned so that publications are not delayed.

The principle of preservation of data and the minimum preservation term of 10 years after the end of the project will be applied without restriction to raw data as well as processed data. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, potential IP requirements or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be made publicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached. As detailed below, metadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse, and will be conform to community norms. Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication or an ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. In this regard, plasmids can be submitted to Addgene (https://www.addgene.org/depositing/start-deposit/). For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted. Before the start of an experiment, suitable metadata standards will be checked at FAIRsharing; using standards as the Minimal Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations (MIBBI) and OME-TIFF for images. The latter is used by the OMERO platform (see section 6). In particular, the following data sets will be stored: Derived and compiled data Dataset 2.1 – Research documentation Research documentation generated or collected from online sources (e.g. pubmed) and from collaborators, including publications, tutorials, laboratory notes, protocols, animal husbandry data. Data formats: -Text files: Rich Text Format (.rtf), plain text data (Unicode, .txt), MS Word (.doc/.docx), eXtensible Mark-up Language (.xml), Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf), LaTex (.tex) format . Estimated yearly storage : 10 MB. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11Dataset 2.2 – Manuscripts Includes text files, illustrations and figures derived and compiled from experimental data. Data formats: -Text files: Rich Text Format (.rtf), plain text data (Unicode, .txt), MS Word (.doc/.docx), eXtensible Mark- up Language (.xml), Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf), LaTex (.tex) format; -Quantitative tabular data: comma-separated value files (.csv), tab-delimited file (.tab), delimited text (.txt), MS Excel (.xls/.xlsx), MS Access (.mdb/.accdb); -Digital images in raster formats: uncompressed TIFF (.tif/.tiff), JPEG (.jpg), JPEG 2000 (.jp2), Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf), bitmap (.bmp), .gif; -Digital images in vector formats: scalable vector graphics (.svg), encapsulated postscript (.eps), Scalable Vector Graphics (.svg), Adobe Illustrator (.ai); -Digital video data: MPEG-4 High Profile (.mp4), motion JPEG 2000 (.mjp2), Audio Video Interleave (.avi) . Estimated yearly storage : 150 MB. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes that refer to specific datasets. While specific data types might require particular metadata, as a general rule the metadata will be based on a generalized metadata schema such as Dublin Core or DataCite, including the following elements: • Title: free text • Creator: Last name, first name, organization • Date and time reference • Subject: Choice of keywords and classifications • Description: Text explaining the content of the data set and other contextual information needed for the correct interpretation of the data, the software(s) (including version number) used to produce and to read the data, the purpose of the experiment, etc. • Format: Details of the file format, • Resource Type: data set, image, audio, etc. • Identifier: DOI (when applicable) • Access rights: closed access, embargoed access, restricted access, open access. For specific datasets, additional metadata will be associated with the data file as appropriate. The final dataset as deposited in the chosen data repository will be accompanied by this information under the form of a README.txt document. This file will be located in the top level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used. This will allow the data to be understood by other members of the laboratory/scientific community and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse. 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13Where will the data be stored? As a rule, digital data will be stored on KU Leuven servers. All omics data generated during the project will be stored on KU Leuven servers or, for larger datasets, on The Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC) in the staging area, at first. Upon publication, all omics data supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available via open access repositories such as the PRIDE Archive for proteomics data, the EMBL-EBI platform for genomics and epigenomics data, and the LIPID MAPS Lipidomics Gateway for lipidomics data. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.The operating system of the KU Leuven vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of upgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound by the ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. Stored data is backed up using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. As standard, 10% of the requested storage is reserved for backups using the following backup regime: an hourly backup (at 8 a.m., 12 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.), the last 6 of which are kept; a daily backup (every day) at midnight, the last 6 of which are kept; and a weekly backup (every week) at midnight between Saturday and Sunday, the last 2 of which are kept. A security service monitors the technical installations continuously, even outside working hours. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: We give preference to the use of robust, managed storage with automatic backup. Options include central storage facilities of the research unit, the group or KU Leuven, or a cloud service offered by KU Leuven, all of which have sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project. If no, please specify: 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7For the data produced in this project, we will abide by the Belgian law on the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679. The Privacy Team of KU Leuven will be notified before the start of the project research starts and the Data Stewart will therefore: - designate the categories of persons who have access to the sensitive data, with a precise description of their capacity in relation to the processing of these data; - keep the list of the designated categories of persons at the disposal of the competent supervisory authority (Data Protection Authority); - ensure that the designated persons are obliged by a legal or statutory obligation, or by an equivalent contractual provision, to observe the confidential nature of the data concerned. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?It is the intention to minimize data sharing costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Unless mentioned otherwise, data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. All digital files Digital files will be stored on KU Leuven servers: -the “L-drive” costs 173,78€/TB/Year. This server is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster with NetApp eseries storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front- end. Stored data is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept. -The “J-drive” costs 519€/TB/Year. This server is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controllers with an Ontap 9.1P9 operating system. Stored data is backed up using snapshot technology where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. Backups are performed hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept. Both servers are accessible only by laboratory members, and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. We will FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 15use free-to-use repositories to share digital files, so that there will be no additional cost required to make the data open access. Vectors All published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request. The associated costs are thus minimal (only shipment costs). All other vectors generated during the project will be shared with researchers upon request (handling by the technical staff of the laboratory, shipping costs supported by the receiver). Management of the vector collection is under the responsibility of the PI and the lab manager. Long-term preservation of this collection is of extremely high value for the laboratory, and as a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock (-80°C). These will be stored for the remainder of the PI’s research career. Note that all DNA sequences derived from human subjects will be de-identified. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).The data will be stored for a minimum of 10 years, i.e. at least 5 years after the end of the project. After this period, the PI will regularly evaluate whether retention of the data is still necessary and, if applicable, delete data. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 16Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?Images will be archived using the OMERO platform. Upon publication, all omics data supporting a manuscript will be made publicly available (and archived) via open access repositories such as the PRIDE Archive for proteomics data, the EMBL-EBI platform for genomics and epigenomics data and the LIPID MAPS Lipidomics Gateway for lipidomics data. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?Similarly to the data management costs during the project, data preservation after the end of the FWO project will be covered by the laboratory budget. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 176. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available.
