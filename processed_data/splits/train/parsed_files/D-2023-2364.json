This\nelectrochemical signalling enables vast neural networks to perform complex brain functions. Advances in silicon probe technology now allow us to\nmonitor the electrical signalling within these complex networks with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, we currently lack the technology\nto study neurochemical signalling with equivalent precision, leaving us unable to fully understand neurotransmitter roles across a range of key\nneuroscience and psychology questions. The objectives of this project are: 1) to use nanotechnology in combination with enzymatic and aptamer\nbiorecognition methods to develop an innovative biosensor that can monitor a range of neurotransmitters with high sensitivity and fast temporal\nresolution, and 2) to use this biosensor in various rodent models to provide new insights into the role of these neurotransmitters in (non)invasive\nneuromodulation, cognitive flexibility, and fear and avoidance behavior. This interdisciplinary effort will thus deliver a breakthrough technology for\nsensing neurotransmitters and use it to answer unresolved questions in the fields of neuroscience and psychology.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n05-03-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
