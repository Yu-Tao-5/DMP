Lithium (Li+) extraction from salt lake brines is an effective way to circumvent the lithium supply\nshortage. Given the close hydrated radius of Mg2+ (4.3 Å) and Li+ (3.8 Å) ions, a facile membrane synthesis method is needed to\nfabricate membranes for efficient Li extraction from high Mg2+/Li+ ratio brines. Porous organic molecules (POMs) with inner cavity\ndiameter from 3.2 to 4.3 Å, such as cyclodextrin, calixarene, cucurbituril, and pillararene, will be used as main building blocks to construct\nNF membranes with uniform sub-nanometer pores for precise ion-ion separation. Furthermore, the fundamental mechanisms underlying\ncations transport and selectivity in subnanometer pores will be elucidated to provide the scientific base for the design of NF membranes\nwith high Li+ selectivity.\nLast modified: \n01-05-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
