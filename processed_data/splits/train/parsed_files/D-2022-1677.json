The FWO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.  At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.        \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  2  1.

Antifungal resistance is on the rise, while the antifungal drug market comprises only four classes, significantly reducing survival rates of systemic candidiasis. Nevertheless, insights into the evolutionary dynamics of antifungal resistance are scarce, although they can revolutionize treatment. By using high-throughput experimental evolution, we have mapped collateral sensitivity and cross resistance dynamics under different selective pressures from various antifungal drugs in Candida auris. Collaral sensitivity and cross resistance have been extensively studied in tumours and bacteria, but remain unexplored in fungi. Based on these evolutionary dynamics, we have designed drug cycling and combinatorial treatment schemes that prevent antifungal drug resistance development. In this project our main aim is to prove that certain drug cycling and combinatorial treatment schemes reduce the development of resistance and increase treatment success of C. auris and C. glabrata infections. Moreover, we will generate a vast library of resistant strains, on which a library composed of selected repurposed drugs with antifungal activity will be screened, to identify clinically approved compounds that show collateral sensitivity. This might lead to the discovery of adjuvant drugs that further reduce resistance development in the clinic. At last, resistance mechanisms will be investigated by both genome and targetted sequencing. Our preliminary study shows evidence of several novel mechanisms of (multi)drug resistance, which present a valuable resource for future drug target characterization and drug development.            \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  4  2.

If no, please specify: 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11 How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7 The data will be stored in the university's secure environment What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The expected cost is 500 euro/TB/year. We do not expect to go over that cost. This is part of the consumables on the project. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Both all raw data as well as final processed data presented in papers will be stored on the J drive (shared folder of KU Leuven server). All physical data (e.g. strains in -80°C freezers) will be stored for at least 5 years. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? The data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12 What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? In view of the expected size of the database (less than 1 TB), estimated cost will be below 500 euro to set up the database and an annual fee of 50 euro for support. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INFOEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☐ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. All sequencing data will be made available via the SRA (sequence read archive) of NCBI. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 14 When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’. As soon as the publication has been published as preprint and/or accepted for publication in a peer reviewed journal. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA. ☒ Yes ☐ No If yes: 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 15 What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? Sharing data via NCBI is free of charge. Data present in manuscripts will cost the cost of such publications which may go up to 6500 euro for a paper in Nature Communications. 7. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project? Hans Carolus (PhD student), Dimitrios Sofras (PhD student), Celia Lobo Romero (laboratory technician), Patrick Van Dijck (PI) Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project? Luc Grauwels (ICT support), Who will manage data preservation and sharing? Patrick Van Dijck Who will update and implement this DMP? Patrick Van Dijck"
