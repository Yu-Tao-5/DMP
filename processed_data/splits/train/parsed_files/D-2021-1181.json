In this project, I seek to reconstruct the idea of God in\nthe philosophy of Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, a German philosopher and a contemporary of Kant,\nFichte, Schelling and Hegel. I do so by examining Jacobi's idea of God in his four major\nphilosophical works. The project consists of five chapters arranged in accordance to the\nchronological order of these texts.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. Data Description\nWhat data will you collect or create? Fill out the table below and/or describe.\nFor the purpose of my research, I use the primary texts by Jacobi and secondary literature\npublished by commentators on his philosophy. These include the critical edition of Jacobi's\nphilosophical works, as well as the published books and articles by the scholars of Jacobi's\nphilosophy, both in printed or online formats.\nThe data I will generate in this project include my doctoral dissertation and the scientific papers\nthat I intend to publish.\nDo you intend to reuse existing data?\nNo\nDo you use personal data (i.e. all data possibly identifying an individual)?\nNo\n2. Documentation and Metadata\nDescribe the documentation that will be created for the data. This section deals with\nthe way in which you will document how the dataset was created and subsequently\nprocessed.\nThe data created by this research project include my doctoral dissertation and scientific\npublications.\nDescribe the metadata for the data. This section deals with metadata: information\ncontained in your dataset about the research data.\nThe metadata for the research data consist of my insights and comments on the primary texts\nand secondary literature I study for my research project. These are stored and organised in my\npersonal laptop and binders according to the chapter of my dissertation they belong to, as well\nas the theme of the journal articles I intend to publish. I also use handwritten notes and\nnotebooks for reading notes and writing drafts.\n3.

Data storage and Backup during Research\nHow and where will the data be stored during research?\n1\n. \nDrafts of chapters and scientific publications --- on my personal laptop with an external\ndrive for regular backup\n2\n. \nHandwritten notes --- not scanned into digital format\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 2\n3\n. \nBinders at home\nWhich back-up procedures are in place?\nI use an external drive for my personal laptop for the purpose of daily backup.\nDescribe the data security procedures and who has access to the data.\nAs the principle researcher, I am the only person who has access to the data I produce in the\nprocess of my research.
