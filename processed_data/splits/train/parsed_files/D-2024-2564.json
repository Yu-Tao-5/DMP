It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all materials that need proper management because they are valuable, difficult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentation/metadata. RDM Guidance on data If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type. / FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 7Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)?

If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please comment: Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3.Documentation and Metadata FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .The main researcher will collect all data and group the different data files in het secured KU Leuven folder. For each study, a separate folder will be created. Per folder, and thus for each study, the main researcher will upload the raw dataset as well as the analytical dataset (the dataset that will be used to conduct analyses and test hypotheses). With respect to the analytical dataset, the main researcher will –for each study –upload a word document, explaining how the dataset was cleaned (for example, removal of participants that failed the attention check). Regarding understandability and re-use, codes will be well-explained within each dataset. Specifically, with respect to the SPSS data files, each code will be clearly labelled, meaning that we will give a clear description of the item that was measured and name it accordingly. Uploaded dataset and interview guides will be in English to enable cross-cultural re-use. All data transformations and analyses performed on these datasets will be explained in a document and stored in a safe folder. Datasets in OSF will be accompanied by metadata so datasets are understandable for later re-use. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: For the focus group study a metadatafile will be created including the semi-structured interview guide and the context specific information in which the focus group interviews were conducted. For the ecological momentary assessment study (EMA) a metadatafile (with compiled data) will be created in the following steps: 1) a unique identification code is given to each participant; 2) participants answers across consecutive days will be linked in diary research through their unique identification codes. After participants have been linked, the unique identification codes will be deleted and the metadatafile will no longer contain personal information and will be pseudonymized. For the longitudinal survey study a metadatafile (with compiled data) will be created in the following steps: 1) a unique identification code will be given to each participant; 2) participants’ answers across waves will be linked through their unique identification codes. After participants have been linked, the unique identification codes will be deleted and the metadatafile will no longer contain personal information and will be pseudonymized. For the experimental study a detailed explanation will be given for the experimental protocol so this methodology can be used again. This explanation includes detailed information on the creation of the stimuli material, the manipulation check used to validate the stimuli material, and the circumstances in which the experiment was conducted. 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Where will the data be stored?

CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data The secure central storage infrastructure of KU Leuven has very strict rules of access. Access is personal to KU Leuven employees (who received access) and can only be obtained through the password protected intranet or through VPN. The ICTS of KU Leuven guarantees the safety and ensures to update this platform to be resilient to cyber-attacks. The personal data will only be used by the primary researchers of KU Leuven (i.e., main researcher) and will not be distributed to anyone else. This personal data will be stored separately from the pseudonymized data sets FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?There are no additional costs for this project. Costs are covered by the research group. The I- and J-drive can be accessed for this project 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).
