All human tissue samples will be registered with a Belgian biobank, in compliance with the Belgian law on human body material (dd 19-12-2008). Omics data: omics data generated during the project will either be stored on KU Leuven servers Cell lines: Newly human created cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid nitrogen storage and will be deposited in the UZ Leuven-KU Leuven Biobank. Other human cell lines will be stored locally in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory when actively used for experiments. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up?

How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Samples will be stored in the archive of O&N3, Campus Gasthuisberg. This room has a separate key to open the door. Access to O&N3 is controlled by electronic badge readers. The primary storage location for the data is on password-protected KU Leuven personal computers, with immediate backup to secure network-attached, redundant disk arrays managed by the lab, accessible only to selected members of the lab. Long term storage for data that does not require repeated fast access is provided by the KU Leuven ICTS' Large Volume Storage service. Created using DMPonline.be.
