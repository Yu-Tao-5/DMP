Sample \ndata  Physical measurements \nof the samples \n(dimensions, weight, ...)   Measurement data is stored in standardized spreadsheets, mentioning, \nmaterial, measurement device/settings, date of measurement  \n3. Job files  Files containing print job \nparameters and settings  Job files will be referenced in the overviewing sample documentation \nspreadsheets (see 1.).  \n4. Images  High resolution macro \nand micro images \n(camera, OM, SEM) of \nsamples  For optical microscopy images, the machine automatically stores the following \ninformation: image type, dimensions, data, lighting settings, zoom, lens name, \nand tilt angle. For scanning electron microscopy images, the machine \nautomatically includes paramet ers such as zoom level, beam voltage, image \nsize, and image creation date. This data is stored in .txt files accompanying the \nimage files. Figure naming will follow a consistent rule system \n(OM_JobName_SampleCode_ImageNumber or \nSEM_JobName_SampleCode_Image Number) that can easily be linked to the \nphysical samples, for which the overviewing spreadsheets (see 1.) contain the \ndetails. Microscopic images always contain a scale.   \n5.

If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) whic h \nmetadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse.  \n \nNo. \nAn own -defined standard spreadsheet is created for the storage of information about a sample fabrication and analysis. This \nformat can be appended with sheets referring to specific test procedures. This allows a clear link between a sample (and its \nproduct ion parameters) and the analysis performed on this sample (and the relevant test parameters).\n3. DATA STORAGE & BACK -UP DURING THE RESEARCH \nPROJECT  \nWhere will the data be stored?  \n \nThe data is stored at a dedicated location on the KUL NAS servers (with automatic back -up \nprocedures), secured and managed by the central ICTS service of KU Leuven.  \n \n \nHow will the data be backed up?  \n \nOffline backup creation on a separate hard drive is performed quarterly.   \n \n \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely.  \nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be \ntaken care of.  \n \nYes . \nSufficient storage & backup capacity (2 TB) is allocated to the research project on both KUL \nNAS servers and a separate hard drive.  \n \n \nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by \nunauthorized persons?  \n \nNo sensitive data will be created in this project.  \nSeparate file sharing folders are provided by the university, ensuring no shared access to \nthe data, unless specifically required.  \n \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?  \n \nThe expected cost for data storage during the project is not expected to exceed â‚¬100/year, \nwhich will be covered either by the FWO bench fee or AM research group financial reserves.  \n \n  \n4. DATA PRESERVATION AFTER THE END OF THE \nRESEARCH PROJECT  \nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention \npolicies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be \npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractu al restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, institutional policies...).  \n \nNo data requiring restrictions on data preservations will be generated, thus all data can be \nstored for the required 10 years according to the KU Leuven RDM policy.  \n \n \nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)?  \n \nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back -up \nprocedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.  \n \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How \nwill these costs be covered?  \n \nThe KU Leuven offers backed up cold storage of data at â‚¬99,55/TB/year. The expected cost \nfor cold storage of the data after the project is therefore not expected to exceed â‚¬100/year, \nwhich will be covered by the AM research group financial reserves. If the  amount of data to \nbe stored exceeds 2 TB, additional storage will be purchased and covered by the AM \nresearch group financial reserves.  \n  \n5. DATA SHARING AND REUSE  \nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  In the \ncomment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available.  \n \nYes , in an Open Access repository  \n \n \nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what \nconditions.  \n \n/ \n \n \nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined \nin an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section \nper dataset or data type where appropriate.  \n \nNo \n \n \nWhere will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per \ndataset or data type.  \n \n1. The data will be shared on the  KU Leuven Research Data repository (known as RDR), \nwhich can be found here:  https://rdr.kuleuven.be  \n2. The repository has limited space for fee -less sharing of data. Hence, the largest file \ntypes ( ultra -high -resolution  microstructural images and simulation data) will only be \navailable upon request.   \n \n \nWhen will the data be made available?  \n \n1. In case the data is used for a publication, the data will be made available for use after \nthe final publication  \n2. In other cases, the dataset will be made available after the public defense of the FWO \nfellow's thesis dissertation  \n \n \nWhich data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why.  \n \nThe datasets will be made available under a  CC-BY-NC-4.0 license, meaning free sharing \nand adaptation of data is allowed provided that they give appropriate credit to the creators, \nbut commercial use is prohibited.  \n \n \nDo you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you \nhave the option to provide it in the comment section.  \n \nYes . \nThe KU Leuven Research Data repository (known as RDR) uses a DIO identifier.  \n \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?  \n \n1. The datasets are believed to stay within the 50 GB free limit of the RDR, meaning that no \nextra costs are expected.  \n2. In case a larger set of data is created, part of the allocated project budget can be used \nto cover these costs  \n  \n6. RESPONSIBILITIES  \n \nWho will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project?  \n \n                      Waut Declercq - FWO fellow                      \n \n \nWho will manage data storage and backup during the research project?  \n \n                      Waut Declercq - FWO fellow                      \n \n \nWho will manage data preservation and sharing?  \n \n                      Brecht Van Hooreweder - PI / PhD promotor                      \n \n \nWho will update and implement this DMP?  \n \n                      The PI bears the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP.                      \n \n "
