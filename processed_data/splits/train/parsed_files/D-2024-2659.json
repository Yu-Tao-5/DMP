An obvious\nproperty of such low energy theories is the number of visible dimensions. However, a prediction of string theory is the existence of extra dimensions,\nwhose vibrations behave as particles with masses inversely proportional to the size of the extra dimensions. It is therefore crucial to know whether such\nvibrations can be measured at low energy. This is where the Swampland program comes into play: are low-energy theories with small extra dimensions\ncompatible with quantum gravity? I aim to settle this question by combining techniques from supergravity and holography.\nOn the gravity side, I will study the backreaction of orientifolds, which is the main source of debate regarding the consistency of string vacua which\nexhibit small extra dimensions. Once this backreaction is better understood, I will contrast it with a recent mathematical conjecture by Yau et. al.,\nwhich will either upset the current view on flux compactifications in string theory or provide an interesting counterexample to the conjecture.\nOn the CFT side, I will investigate how many visible space dimensions holographic CFTs can reconstruct. For instance, a recent connection between\nthe weak gravity conjecture and large extra dimensions will be translated into a CFT statement. This will likely lead to new conjectures on the space of\nCFTs, which I will then attempt to prove.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n02-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
