Imagine how many disasters we can prevent through\nmonitoring, how many lives we can save through search & rescue operations, and how many secrets\nof the unexplored territories we can unveil. One of the key technologies that will make this happen is\nStructure-from-Motion (SfM). This fundamental problem in computer vision addresses the task of\nreconstructing camera poses and scene structure from a set of unordered images. Unfortunately, the\ndeployment of the aforementioned applications is hindered by the current limitations of SfM. In this\nproject, I propose a novel approach for SfM that is robust to extremely challenging environments,\nand at the same time, scalable to millions of images. The main challenges are that (1) the images\ncollected in the wild are prone to a large fraction of outliers and (2) reconstructing millions of images\nis very time-consuming, especially when there are outliers. I propose to tackle these challenges\nthrough the following efforts: (1) Redesigning the pipeline in an innovative way, (2) enhancing some\nof the components significantly compared to the state of the art, and (3) thereby removing the need\nfor the full bundle adjustment at the end of the pipeline. Specifically, this project will involve multiple\nnovel contributions in relative pose estimation, rotation/translation averaging, and rotation/pose-only\noptimization.\nID: \nID: \n211439\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n03-12-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
