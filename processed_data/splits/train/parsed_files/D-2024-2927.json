Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). For better preservation of data, experimental methodology, planning and protocol will be logged in personal lab books and a word document. For each experiment, the experiment number, date, conditions, outcome, and characterization will be documented in a detailed fashion. For long-term storage, an electronic copy of the data will be stored on OneDrive or one of KU Leuven online servers (J and K-Drive). Raw and processed data of every reaction will be stored in a separate folder. Folders of experiments that fall under a single subproject or correspond to data that will be used in a single publication will be merged in one folder to make sure that if any part of that work needs to be reused, all the data will be found in a single location. An overview of the experiment number, the location in the lab book, the physical location of the sample, and the digital storage locations of the raw and processed data will be provided in a separate file.

Yes When conclusive data analyses is achieved, data will be deposited in the Research Data Repository (RDR) of KU Leuven (https://rdr.kuleuven.be/). The data will also be available in the open-access supplementary information of publications (with DOIs).
