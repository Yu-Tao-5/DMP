More specifically, my goal is to  describ e the neura l \npathway that convey s information about  novelty to midbrain dopaminergic system. To do so, \nI use mice as an animal model and  collect data on their response to novel stimuli: at the \nbehavioral level (videos) and on the neural level ( electrophysiolog ical or fiber p hotometry  \nrecordings ). I also keep brain slice s to ensure proper localization  of the e lectrodes  and/or \nexpression of viral vectors . \n \nInstitution KU L euven  \n \n1.

Data description  \nWill you generate/collect new data and/or  make use of existing data?  \nGenerate new data  \n \nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its \n(estimated) volume. This may be  easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and \nper WP or objective of the project. If you  reuse existing  data, specify the source of these \ndata. Distinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the  technical  \nformat).  \nThe research will generate  \n- Anatomical data: Microscopy images and anatomical reconstructions (.tif,jpeg,digital ). \nPhysical originals (brain sections) are  \nsaved as well. 100 GB maximum.  \n- Behavioral data (digital) including videos of breathing rate, pupil dilation , stimulus  \ndelivery times and choices. We will save raw data toget her with their extracted information \n(.mov, .mat, tdms). 1TB.  \n- Electrophysiological data (digital): raw recording data will be saved together with \nprocessed, spike -sorted data.  \n(.ap,tdms,.mat,.npy) 20 TB.  \n- Fiber  photome try data (dig ital):  fluor escence traces  across all recording  channels  will be \nsaved (.csv). 100GB maximum.  \n \n3. Legal and ethical issues  \nWill you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will \nuse. Add the reference to  your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for \nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application).  \nBe aware that registering the fact that you process  personal data is a legal obligation.  \nNo \nPrivacy Registry Reference:  \nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used:  \n \nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. \nexperiments on humans or  animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal \napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)  \nYes â€“ animal research  \nEthica l approval no. 161/2021 \n \nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and \nvalorisation? Will IP  restrictions be claimed for the data y ou created? If so, for what \ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?  \nNo \n \nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you \n(re)use? If so, to what  data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?  \nNo \n \n4. Docum entation and metadata  \nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in \nthis project?  \n1. The behavioral and neural preprocessed data will be made available on a python (numpy) \nformat with an  explicit name for each varia ble and a readme for a good comprehension of the \ndataset.  \n2. The raw data will be available on request and will be given with a readme ensuring a good \nunderstanding of  the dataset.  \n3. The image of the brain will be upload with the metadata of the microsco pe, reusable using \nthe free software  ImageJ.  \n4. The code of the analysis will be put online on github as soon as the results will be made \npublic. This code will  be commented and a readme will garantee the good understanding for \nthe users.  \n \nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used. \nIf no, state in detail  which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find \nand reuse.  \nYes. The data will be made available on a python (numpy) format with an explicit name for \neach variable and a  readme for a good comprehension of the dataset. The image of the brain \nwill be upload with the metadata of the  confocal microscope, reusable using t he free software \nImageJ.  \n \n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project  \nWhere will the data be stored?  \n1. The brain slices will be stored in the fridge of the laboratory.  \n2. The behavioral and neural data will be stored on the server sysfs01. A back -up is used on \nanother server, and the  investigator will keep another copy of the data on a hard -disk at h is \nplace.  \n \nHow is backup of the data provided?  \nThe data will be stored on two different servers at the institute, and a third back -up will be \nkeep at the i nvestigator place on a  hard disk to avoid losing the data in case of natural \ndisaster.  \n \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, \nspecify concisely. If no or  insufficient storage or backup capacities are available t hen \nexplain how this will be taken care of.  \nYes. \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will \nthese costs be covered?  \nThe servers are already there, so only the costs of energetic consumptions are taken into \naccount. It should not be more than  1000 euros per year depending on the electricity price \nand those costs will be covered by the VIB grant of my principal investigator Sebastian \nHaesler.  \n \nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or \nmodified by  unauthorized persons?  \nAn engineer in computer science is paid by the institute to ensure the security of the servers.  \n \n6. Data preservation after the FWO project  \nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? \nIn case only a selection of  the data can/will be preserv ed, clearly state the reasons for \nthis (legal or contractual restrictions, physical  preservation issues, ...).  \n- Anatomical data: Microscopy images and anatomical reconstructions (digital). Physical \noriginals (brain sections) are saved as  well, however, th e physical original might not hold for \n5 years because of physical preservation issues.  \n- Behavioral data (digital) including videos of breathing rate, pupil dilation , stimulus  \ndelivery times and choices. We will save r aw data together with their extracted information.  \n- Electrophysiological data (digital).  \n- Raw recording data will be saved together with processed, spike -sorted data  \n \nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?  \n1. in the laboratory fri dge for the brain sections ; \n2. on the server sysneuro for the microscopy image and reconstruction;  \n3. on the servers syskrunch and sysfs01 for the behavioral data , the electrophysiological \ndata and the raw and processed  recording data.  \n \nWhat are the expecte d costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 \nyears? How will the costs be  covered?  \n1. The global costs of the servers in term of electricity is estimated to 5000 euros on 5 years. \nThose costs will be covered using  \nthe VIB grant of Sebasti an Haesler.  \n2. The cost of the fridge for 5 years is less than 500 euros and is shared among different grant \nincluding the VIB one of  Sebastian Haesler.  \n \n7. Data sharing and reuse  \nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as \ndefined in an agreement  with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?  \nNo \n \nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?  \n1.
