This involves automatic\nversion management of the files. Version management is done using\n\"snapshot\" technology, where the previous versions of the changed files are kept online in a snapshot on the same storage\nsystem.\nby default, 1 snapshot is taken daily and is kept for 14 days. So you can go back to previous versions of the file up to 14\ndays.\nend users can restore older files themselves from within their Windows PC via the \"previous versions | previous versions\"\nfunctionality.\nAt ILVO, the backup process includes:\nA (working) daily backup where versions are kept up to 3 months back.\nA (working) daily file copy where only the latest version is available.\nA monthly backup to offsite tape.\nThe ILVO sharepoint services in the cloud rely on the MS backup policy. Deleted documents can be recovered up to 3 months\nback.\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

For the genome sequence data generated, samples are registered and results and metadata recorded in standard bioinformatics file formats according to established guidelines agreed upon at ILVO and KUL level. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? During the PhD: Phage strains will be stored at 4°C as PEG stock in KUL and ILVO. Bacterial strains will be stored at -80°C as glycerol stock in KUL and ILVO. Digital data will be stored in the shared network drive (J:) from KU Leuven and the shared ILVO folder 'ILVO\\Fytobacteriologie - Documenten\\General\\Projecten\\Phage therapy' At ILVO, sequencing results will be stored on the Genomics server, in the 'Fytopathologie (W:)\\Sequencing' folder and in the BioNumerics database. After the PhD: Phage strains will be stored at 4°C as PEG stock in KU Leuven and ILVO Bacterial strains will be stored at -80°C as glycerol stock in KU Leuven and ILVO. Digital data will be stored in the large volume storage from KU Leuven (K:) and ILVO. Published data will be deposited in public databases/repositories (such as GenBank for sequencing data) How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Data will be backed-up according to the standard back-up procedures provided by KU Leuven ICTS. This involves automatic version management of the files. Version management is done using \"snapshot\" technology, where the previous versions of the changed files are kept online in a snapshot on the same storage system. by default, 1 snapshot is taken daily and is kept for 14 days. So you can go back to previous versions of the file up to 14 days. end users can restore older files themselves from within their Windows PC via the \"previous versions | previous versions\" functionality. At ILVO, the backup process includes: A (working) daily backup where versions are kept up to 3 months back. A (working) daily file copy where only the latest version is available. A monthly backup to offsite tape. The ILVO sharepoint services in the cloud rely on the MS backup policy. Deleted documents can be recovered up to 3 months back. Created using DMPonline.be.

Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Physical data: Sufficient space at 4°C and -80°C has been allocated for this project. Digital data: the large storage volume (K:) at KUL has a storage capacity of 6TB. If more space is needed, extra storage space can be bought per TB. Also the storage capacity of ILVO's drives and Genomics server is more than sufficient for the expected data. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Physical data can only be accessed by authorized personnel (utilizing batch systems in both host institutions). Digital data access is controlled through standard IT practices, restricting access to relevant personnel only. Data is always transferred over encrypted connections. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The costs for storing and backup of large datasets equals: €104,42/TB each year at KU Leuven. ILVO server: €55/TB per year ILVO online storage: 132€/TB per year Upon publication, relevant data will be made available in either appropriate repositories or e.g. using generic services such as zenodo.org, dryad, etc. These services will ensure long-term storage. Costs will be covered by the research groups. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project 4.
