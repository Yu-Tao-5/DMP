Amputated body parts do not contribute to gait\npropulsion or stability, leading to reduced walking performance. Active prostheses emerged to\naddress the loss of propulsive capacity. Although active devices are capable of providing the\nmechanical work needed for locomotion, they fail at restoring walking performance. We\nhypothesize that current active prostheses fail at restoring gait performance because their\ncontrol is incompatible with amputee movement strategies. Besides motor function, amputees\nlack feedback from the amputated limb segments which is crucial for balance control. Therefore,\nprosthesis controllers that are designed to reduce the metabolic cost of walking might not be\neffective for amputees who prioritize stability. In addition, there might be large inter-subject\ndifferences in how much individuals prioritize stability over effort. The goal of this project is to\ndesign and validate controllers for active prostheses that optimize the synergetic user-prosthesis\nbehavior for transtibial amputees. We will use computational and experimental approaches. We\nwill develop a simulation framework to design prosthesis controllers that optimize walking\nperformance according to the userâ€™s stability preferences. Controller design will be inspired\nby insights in human balance control derived from experimental observations. \nIn this project the\nnovel active ankle prosthesis controller will be designed and validated based on computer\nsimulations and experimental data. This means that the data set acquired in the different studies\nwill encompass: 1) Data used for simulations of amputee locomotion (e.g. models and scripts for\nsimulations pipeline), and 2) experimental data of amputee locomotion (e.g. motion capture,\noxygen consumption, and EMG data)\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
