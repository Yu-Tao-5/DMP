The result of these extreme events\ncan be devastating (e.g. July 2021). The impact of pluvial floods are further excarbated by an increasing urbanisation, also in Flanders. Due to the short\nresponse times of the hydrological system in highly urbanised catchments and the high economic and societal value of city centres, these areas are\nespecially vulnerable to the impact of extreme precipitation. Therefore, mitigation measures such as performant flood warning systems are of high\nimportance. Detailed real-time estimations of floods are valuable for emergency operation management, but are, however, nonexistant in most areas\naround the world. \nThe development of performant probabilistic real-time pluvial flood forecasting systems typically entails (i) probabilistic precipitation forecasting and\n(ii) deterministic real-time flood modelling. The focus of this research proposal is on the creation of real-time flood models.

Synthetically generated input data, as well as simulation results will be stored using a descriptive folder/file structure that is detailed in a dedicated .pdf 5 . Parameters of data-driven models created within this PhD project, as well as the models themselves, will be stored in appropriate formats (.csv, .pkl, ...)

Yes For the (parts of the) data that will be published in OA repositories, a metadata standard compatible with the repository will be used (e.g. Dublin Core or Datacite). 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? During the research project, preliminary and intermediate results will be stored on the laptop of the PhD student as well as on external harddrives (backup). In addition, KU Leuven network drives will be used for transfering files between computer systems. Relevant code and final results will be stored on cloud servers using services provided by KU Leuven (KU Leuven Gitlab, OneDrive, local KU Leuven network drives). These cloud services meet the FWO requirements for backups (saved at multiple locations etc.) How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? SyncBackFree will be used for scheduling and automating backups. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 18 April 2024 4 of 7 Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Preliminary and intermediate results (e.g. simulation results) require storage exceeding the available storage space of a typical laptop. Hence, external hard drives are used to store these. Final results require significantly less storage, and are thus suitable for storage on laptop and cloud services. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Physically accessible systems (laptop, external hard drives) are password protected. Cloud services (both KU Leuven as external) require login details. Login detailes are managed by the PhD researcher. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The costs related to laptop and external hard drives are covered by the bench fee provided by FWO. Services provided by KU Leuven are coverd by the university/department/supervisor. 4.

In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). institutional policies...). All reused and generated data will be retained for at least 10 years after the end of the project. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? 1) Data used for publications will be published in Open Access with an DOI identifier. 2) Other data, including code/data/background material not directly used in publications, will be stored on KU Leuven systems (central servers with automatic back-up procedures). 3) Structured code repositories will be stored on KU Leuven's Gitlab using the git paradigm. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?

Yes, Intellectual Property Rights Yes, Other Parts of the hydrodynamic model for the city of Antwerp was conceived by Aquafin, who share their model for research projects at KU Leuven. The meteorological datasets used in this research are conceived and belong to Federal and Regional institutes (e.g. RMI, VMM, HIC). Not all of which are public (RMI). Note that no formal agreements were signed with relation to the non-public datasets. However, sharing this data should not occur without approval of the data providors out of respect for them and in order to maintain good professional relationships that might result in additional datasets in the future. The rainfall radar products offered by RMI are not public and can thus not be disseminated to third parties without permission. Formal agreements are in place in the framework of an internship agreement between the PhD researcher and the RMI (supervised by PhD committee member prof. Ricardo Reinoso-Rondinel).
