More\nspecifically, how can we detect seizures using wearable medical sensors and how to build a\nrobust multimodal framework (EEG, ECG, and EMG) to be used in non-controlled environments.\nThe data to be used was collected within the SeizeIT2 project.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. General Information\nName applicant\nMiguel Maiur Claro Bhagubai\nFWO Project Number & Title\n1SB5922N\nPhD fellow strategic basic research \nAffiliation\nKU Leuven\n2. Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nReuse existing data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nA large dataset is being collected in the EIT-funded SeizeIT2 project. This contains video-\nelectroencephalography (vEEG), electrocardiography (ECG) and electromyography (EMG) data of\nepileptic patients. Additionally, patients are simultaneously recorded with the byteflies wearable\nEEG, ECG and EMG sensors. The data is annotated by neurologists and stored in EDF format\n(european data format). The total estimated volume is 1000 - 1500 GB.\nThe data is going to be used to build and test machine/deep learning models, in which features\nfrom the different modalities are extracted (either manually, with the use of standard signal\nprocessing techniques; or automatically, in the case of deep learning, in which the features are\nextracted via data-driven approaches). The framework will be built with the use of MatLab (The\nMathWorks Inc.) and Python.\n3. Legal and ethical issues\nWill you use personal data? \nIf so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will\nuse. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for\nResearch and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). \nBe aware that registering\nthe fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nYes\nPrivacy Registry Reference:\nShort description of the kind of personal data that will be used: anonymized physiological\nmeasurements (EEG, EMG, ECG) and annotations of epileptic seizures.\nThe PI of the Seize IT2 project (Wim Van Paesschen), who is in charge of data collection, is\ncurrently applying for a Privacy.\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nYes\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 3\nEthical approval from CTC under number S63631\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nYes\nThe data cannot be disseminated until the clinical trial ends (June 2022), which is covered by the\noriginal ethical approval. We do not generate novel data, so no extra restrictions are in place.\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nIn the context of the Seize IT2 project, the data has been organized in an easily shareable format\n(so it can be shared after the end of the clinical trial). This data is organized in EDF format, and\nannotations are standardized in .csv format so they can be easily read for further analysis.\nDuring the development of the seizure detection frameworks, the methodologies will be\ndocumented in text/report format. Additionally, the code and scripts will have documentation\nand commented lines for ease of reproducibility.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nYes\nSee EDF: European Data Format\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nThe code and clinical datasets are stored on the ESAT servers (Department of Electrical\nEngineering, KU Leuven), where access is regulated by an access control list (ACL) that grants:\n- read/write access to the project owner\n- read-only access to specific users\nThe ACL is managed by the project owner. Client computers can access the data using SMB2\nfrom specific IP ranges or NFSv4 from specific (IT-managed) systems.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nData in ESAT servers is daily backed up. It is also replicated in an off-site storage system and will\nbe stored at least 5 years after the research project ends.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThe available storage on the ESAT servers is larger than the maximum estimated volume of the\ndataset.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nCosts are automatically covered by ESAT, the host department.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nSee above, answer on ACL.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 3\n6.
