We will examine the structure and\nfunction of paracellular and transcellular transport in the large intestine.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. General Information\nName of the project lead (PI)\nProf. Dr. B. Meijers\nInternal Funds Project number & title\nProject number:\nC14/21/103\nProject title: \nThe gut barrier as master regulator of microbiome-host interactions in IBD and CKD patients:\nexploring the structure and function of paracellular and transcellular transport in the large\nintestine.\n2. Data description\n2.1. Will you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nReuse existing data\n2.2. What data will you collect, generate or reuse? Describe the origin, type and\nformat of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a\nnumbered list or table and per objective of the project.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 5\nType of data     \nFormat\nVolume\nHow created\nRNA sequencing\n.count\n.xls\n.tif\n20 GB\nRNA sequencing\ndata of colon\ncells/organoids\nafter stimulation\nwith selected\ncompounds\nCollection of\nbiopsies and/or\nfeces\n.xls\n1 GB\nCollection,\nprocessing and\nstorage of\nbiopsies and or\nfeces\nRT-qPCR data\n.xls\n.eds\n1 GB\nRT-qPCR data of\norganoids after\nstimulation with\nselected\ncompounds\n16S rRNA\nsequencing\nR file\nTSV file\n1 GB\n16S rRNA\nsequencing of\nmicrobiota\nsamples\nWestern blot data\n.tiff\n1 GB\nPictures of\nwestern blot and\nanalysis\nBarrier\nmeasurements\n(Transepithelial\nelectrical\nresistance)\n.xls\n1 GB\nMeasurements of\nTEER of epithelial\ncells\nClinical metadata\n.xls\n1 GB\nCollection of\nclinically relevant\nmetadata\nencoded in a\npseudonymised\nmanner \nMetabolomics\ndata\n.raw\n.xls\n5 GB\nLC/MS-MS\n3. Ethical and legal issues\n3.1. Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you\nwill use. Add the reference to the file in KU Leuven's Record of Processing Activities.\nBe aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nPersonal data will be used. We will use the 'klinisch werkstation' (KWS, Nexuzhealth) as source\ndata. Study participants will have their study number recorded in the KWS. For new studies, we\nwill use REDCAP as eCRF. The study ID will be stored separately from pseudonimized clinical data\nin Redcap. We will store the following pseudonimized data: demographics, markers of kidney\nfunction, drug therapy, coded past medical history, smoking status, bowel disorders. \n3.2. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s).\nWe will use data and tissue obtained from patients. Two protocols have already received ethics\napproval (S53684 for organoid experiments and sampling of colonic tissue/faeces from IBD\npatients; S62454 for colon biopsies from patients having CKD). \n3.3. Does your research possibly result in research data with potential for tech\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 5\n3.3. Does your research possibly result in research data with potential for tech\ntransfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If\nso, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted?\nIt is not anticipated that IPR will be claimed on the data generated. In the event that there surges\nany\npotential for IPR, rapid interaction with LRD will be initiated.\n3.4. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the\ndata you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions regarding\nreuse and sharing are in place?\nThere are no third party agreements in place restricting dissemination or exploitation of the data.\n4. Documentation and metadata\n4.1. What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of the\ndata collected/generated in this project?\nA readme file will be provided with each of the datasets (clinical and experimental data on\nclinical\nsamples).\nRaw expression data files, and image files will be collected per sample. A metadata file will be\nprovided\nwith the clear description of what the raw data files represent and how they were generated. This\nmetadata file will be kept in the same folder as the expression data.\nResearch methods will be fully documented as word files.\n4.2. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be\nused. If not, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nCurrently the use of shared metadata standard(s) has not been implemented in the daily routine\nof the different research groups. Standard metadata formats will be explored during the project,\ne.g. using the Dublin core (http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadatastandards/dublin-core). In\ncase we reach common ground on metadata standards during the course of the project, this will\nbe reported at the end of the project.\n5. Data storage and backup during the project\n5.1. Where will the data be stored?\nThe master copy of the data will be kept on our research unit central storage facility. Copies of\npart of the data can be made for detailed analysis, but will not be allowed to stored on personal\ndevices in case human data are involved. We will use the KU Leuven enterprise box to share\nongoing research topics, allowing for multiple persons to work and collaborate around the same\ndatasets. \n5.2. How will the data be backed up?\nThe data will be stored on the centrally managed KU and UZ Leuven servers with automatic daily\nback-up\nprocedures and version tracking.\n5.3. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nThe current storage and backup capacity is sufficient for the clinical, genotype/transcriptomic\nand metabolomic/metagenomic data storage.\n5.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nWe anticipate a back-up cost per Tb (KU Leuven ICTS) of 295€/year (5 Tb anticipated).\nIn principle, we don't anticipate needing the KU Leuven ICTS digital vault, as all data with high\nprivacy\nrisks (i.e. the codes to decode the pseudonymization) will be stored behind the firewall of UZ\nLeuven. The costs will be shared between the participating labs, and are part of the running costs\nof the labs.\n5.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not\naccessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 5\nAll data will be coded (i.e. pseudonymized). There continues to be a link between the data and\nthe\nindividual who provided it. The subjects' identifiers will however be stored separately (site file)\nfrom their\nresearch data and replaced with a unique code to create a new identity for the subject. This code\nis\nstored on the UZ Leuven server which is password protected, but which also allows to consult the\nelectronic medical chart of the patient stored on UZ Leuven Hospital servers, only if necessary.\nIn addition, we will store all data on the central servers of the KU and UZ Leuven, which are\nprotected\nagainst unauthorized access by firewalls.\n6. Data preservation after the end of the project\n6.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the\nproject? If only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is\nthe case (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nThe pseudonymized data will be preserved for at least 20 year period after end of this project.\nThe\ngenerated data will be stored on designated KU and UZ Leuven servers.\n6.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)?\nThe generated data will be stored on designated KU and UZ Leuven servers (KU Leuven\nEnterprise Box,\nKU Leuven Large Volume Storage, UZ Leuven server).\n6.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How\nwill the costs be covered?\nLong-term data storage in the UZ Leuven environment is guaranteed by UZ Leuven IT\ndepartment. The long-term cost is shared between collaborators.\n7. Data sharing and re-use\n7.1. Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data\n(e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions or because of IP\npotential)?\n- Pseudonymized (coded) data will only be shared with third parties after agreement and signing\na\ndedicated Data Transfer Agreement or Material Transfer Agreement.\n- Fully anonymized and aggregated data can be shared in Open Access repositories, if necessary\nupon\npublication, or upon request by third parties.\n7.2. Which data will be made available after the end of the project?\n- Pseudonymized (coded) data will not be shared, unless a proper MTA/DTA is in place. This\nimplies that\npseudonymized data will not be made public, also not after the end of the project.\n- Publicly relevant anonymized or aggregated datasets could be made available during or after\nthe end of\nthe project.\n7.3. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse?\n- Pseudonymized (coded) data can only be made available after a signed DTA/MTA is in place.\n- Anonymized data can be made available in Open Access repositories (e.g. Gene Expression\nOmnibus\nfor gene expression data; other formats relevant for other type of datasets).\n7.4. When will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nData will be made available upon request, after fulfilling all necessary obligations.\n7.5. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 5\nPseudonymized data will only be made available to third parties after a signed DTA/MTA is in\nplace.\nRelevant anonymized or aggregated data will be made available publicly, upon publication or\nupon\nindividual request. Public data can then be accessed by anyone.\n7.6. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nUsually, data repository in Open Access repositories like Gene Expression Omnibus or\nArrayExpress is free of cost. If\nthere are any costs associated with data sharing to third parties, the costs of this data transfer\nwill be\nnegotiated in the DTA/MTA.\n8. Responsibilities\n8.1. Who will be responsible for the data documentation & metadata?\nThe principal investigator and two co-investigators will share responsible for data documentation\nand metadata, each for the part that is generated under their supervision.\n8.2. Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nThe PI of the project will be the final responsible for data storage and back up during the project.\n8.3. Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and sharing?\nThe PI of the project will ensure data preservation and reuse. All requests for data sharing and\nreuse\nshould be directed to the PI of the study.\n8.4. Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nThe end responsibility for updating and implementing the DMP is with the supervisor (promotor).\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n5 of 5"
