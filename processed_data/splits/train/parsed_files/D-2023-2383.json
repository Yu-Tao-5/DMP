Nearly all currently deployed public-key\nsystems build on the hardness of two computational problems: factoring large integers (RSA) and computing discrete\nlogarithms (ECC). Although these systems are secure against attacks by classical computers, in 1994 Shor showed that\nthese can be broken in polynomial time using a large-scale universal quantum computer.\nRealizing such large-scale quantum computer continues to pose a stubborn engineering problem, but cryptographers\nare taking the threat very seriously. In 2016, the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) announced an\neffort to standardize quantum-resistant replacements of RSA and ECC. After years of cryptanalysis, NIST announced a\nshortlist of candidates which they deemed secure. The problem however is that none of these candidates are provably\nhard, so we must rely on the failure of many experts having spent sufficient effort on trying to break them. Not\nspending sufficient effort on cryptanalysis is extremely dangerous and the risk of over-rushing the standardization\nprocess manifested itself in 2022: totally devastating classical, i.e. non-quantum, attacks were found against Rainbow\nand SIKE, both on the final shortlist of NIST.\nThe shortage of time and effort can only be countered by putting more emphasis on cryptanalytic efforts and on\nexisting mathematical expertise. Moreover, the gap between cryptographers and mathematicians seems to be growing:\nwhereas most mathematicians are well-aware of RSA and ECC, the situation is very different for the new post-quantum\ncandidates.\nThe first goal of this project is to study complex mathematical structures related to post-quantum cryptography with the\naim of cryptanalyzing post-quantum systems. The second goal is to bridge the gap between the community of\nmathematicians and cryptographers. In order to ensure that these newer systems are secure we have to take an\ninterdisciplinary approach and bring together different communities with complementing expertise.\nLast modified: \n05-12-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
