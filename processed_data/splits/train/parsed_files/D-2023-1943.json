This metacognitive capacity of estimating our decision confidence is commonly explained by\nassuming that a decision-maker computes the objective probability that their choice was correct.\nHowever, in practice we see that confidence often deviates from objective accuracy. Two striking\nexamples of this are under- and overconfidence: The phenomenon that some humans are less\nconfident in their decisions than their objective accuracy warrants, while others are more confident\nthan warranted. To fundamentally explain these two biases, I propose an account in which underand\noverconfidence arise from distorted prior beliefs, which influence the confidence computation.\nThe current project seeks to formally establish prior beliefs as a fundamental explanation of underand\noverconfidence by investigating the underlying mechanisms. In a first stage, I want to look at\nthe generalizability of prior beliefs – and thus, persistence of under- and overconfidence – over time\nand tasks. Next, I will explore the link between under- and overconfidence and the willingness to\nshare information. In a final stage, I will test the proposed neural mechanisms of my account using\nfMRI. Together, the results from this project will deepen our theoretical understanding of under- and\noverconfidence, providing valuable information for both the field of metacognition and clinical\npractice.\nLast modified: \n18-04-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

The same folder structure will be followed throughout\ndifferent projects. At the level of the main folder, a README.txt file will be included.
