This proposal addresses the idea to circumvent\nfixation using colloidal P as a new form of P fertilizer, either by provoking mobilisation of colloids\nnative to soil via amendments, or by addition of nanofertilisers. We hypothesize that colloidal P is\nmore bioavailable than added soluble P due to reduced sorption to minerals. Colloids move to plant\nroots by diffusion and locally release P in the rhizosphere. The nanoparticles (NP) entail newly\ndeveloped P loaded Fe colloids (P-Fe NP) and hydroxyapatite NP with modified surface functionalities.\nA new method based on Diffusive Gradient in Thin Film (DGT) will be developed for in situ colloid\nsampling in the rhizosphere to better detect local concentrations of colloids and their impact on\ndiffusive fluxes at micrometer scale. For the first time, colloidal P can be sampled in the undisturbed\nrhizosphere where it can be distinguished from dissolved P, allowing to prove (or disprove) its\ncontribution to P fluxes. Those potentially higher colloidal P fluxes in the soil will be coupled to plant\nP uptake in order to prove its contribution to bioavailability. The project combines rhizosphere\nexperiments with radio-/stable isotope analysis to distinguish added NP from native soil colloids and\nhigh resolution imaging of rhizosphere processes with laser-ablation-ICP-MS.\nID: \nID: \n211258\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-11-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n31-10-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n13-01-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
