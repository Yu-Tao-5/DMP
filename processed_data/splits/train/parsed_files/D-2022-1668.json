One of the reasons for non-recyclability is the presence of dispersed inorganic additives in materials. Such additives are often\nessential to provide materials with desired functional properties or to extend the lifetime of consumer goods. Hence, they cannot be\nentirely avoided in newly manufactured materials. As a consequence of the Waste Hierarchy principle in EU waste policy,\nthermochemical processes, such as incineration and gasification, are to be applied for a safe and irreversible treatment of non-recyclable\nwasted materials. This creates also chances for the advanced recovery of inorganic compounds of high interest in the Circular Economy.\nAs waste enters a thermochemical process, metallic elements in the waste exhibit a behaviour of partitioning and speciation. This\nbehaviour is not well understood yet and complicates the operation of existing industrial incineration processes, as well as the further\ndevelopment of emerging processes for gasification of waste. The project aims at establishing the missing knowledge, to predict and\ncontrol the fate of metallic elements from waste in typical solid-gas environments of thermochemical reactors, through adapting\nconditions of flow, and heat and mass transfer. The research combines a reactor engineering approach with computational chemical\nmodelling, advanced analytical chemistry and unique validation experiments on a dedicated pilot-reactor for in-depth study of the thermal\ndecomposition of solid wasted materials.\nLast modified: \n16-02-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
