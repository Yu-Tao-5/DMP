For sequencing data generation, experiments and protocols are saved in the lab notebook (physical or electronic). Detailed protocols will be published on protocols.io and described in publications. All metadata and pertinent information from the sample preparation and subsequent sequencing is described in lab notebooks. Metadata generated by the sequencing machines is preserved. Any and all used and generated code, scripts and software will be documented and versioned. Jupyter Notebooks that allow for easy documentation of the code will also be used. Additionally, we use electronic lab notebooks to preserve any pertinent information about the analyses. The code is saved on VSC (Flemish Supercomputer) and backed up to GitHub. The scripts, algorithms and any software will be described in manuscripts and publically released and versioned on GitHub and Zenodo. Raw whole genome sequencing data is named as: YYYYMMDD_PROJECT_NAME YYYYMMDD: Sequencing date PROJECT: 3 character project code (in this project, the code is SRC) NAME: descriptive sample name All datasets will be accompanied by metadata that is stored in electronic lab notebooks and in samplesheets.
