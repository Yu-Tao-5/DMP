Antibiotic therapy failure and the chronic\nnature of UTIs can be attributed to a small fraction of transiently non-growing, antibiotic-tolerant\ncells called persisters. An innovative strategy to cure chronic UTIs would be to induce growth\nresumption in UPEC persisters, thereby re-sensitizing them to conventional antibiotics. However,\nour current understanding of persister awakening is far from complete, hampering the\ndevelopment of anti-persister drugs. The aim of this project is to study and understand\nawakening of UPEC persisters in individual cells up to the atomic level. To reach this goal, we\nhave assembled a strong multi-disciplinary consortium with highly complementary expertise. We\nwill identify novel genes and regulatory RNAs involved in awakening by single-cell RNA-seq and\nby screening a pooled CRISPRi library. Furthermore, we will characterize persister effectors at\nunprecedented detail by combining genetic, biochemical and structural approaches. Finally, in\nview of developing therapeutics to stimulate awakening, we will validate our findings in a\ncollection of clinically relevant strains and a model of intracellular infection. Combined, results\nfrom this project will lead to ground-breaking new insights in persister awakening and will pave\nthe way for the development of critically needed anti-persister drugs to effectively clear UTIs.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Throughout the project, these data files will be preserved with their original\nmetadata. For .txt, .csv, .xlsx files containing tabular information, extra tabs or a head text\nsection will be used to explain the data, the meaning of the columns etc. For others lacking a\nformally acknowledged metadata standard, Dublin Core Metadata will be used and a readme file\nwill be saved in the same directory of the datafiles to explain all the various data files and give a\nbroad overview of the analyses steps. Moreover, we will closely monitor MIBBI (Minimum\nInformation for Biological and Biomedical Investigations) for metadata standards that are more\nspecific to our data.\n \nAfter publication or upon submission of manuscripts for publication, all datasets described in the\npublication will be deposited in data repositories (see below). Depending on the repository that is\nused, the metadata standard used by that specific repository will be filled in. Moreover, datasets\nwill need to be registered in VUB’s cris system PURE, where the FOSB (Flemish Open Science\nBoard) metadata schema is used, which is based on the Data Cite metadata standard.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nBIOLOGICAL MATERIAL\nCryotubes will be stored in -80° freezers with restricted access.\n \nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \nAn E-Notebook will be used to collect data. Low-volume data, protocols and analyses will\nsubsequently be stored in secure and internally shared folders on university servers with built-in\nbackup and versioning (SharePoint). Although built-in backup systems are in place, password-\nprotected hard drives equipped with anti-virus programs will be used as backup. A network drive\nwill also be used for large-scale data (e.g. NGS data and microscopy data). A copy of these\ndatasets will be made to desktop PCs with large computational power (or to computing cluster of\nour host institutions) whenever data analyses will be performed. Structural biology data will also\nbe stored at the synchrotron or at the VIB-VUB facility for Bio Electron Cryogenic Microscopy\n(BECM). For final datasets that are part of publications or manuscripts posted on preprint\nservers, datasets will be deposited in publicly available repositories. Depending on the data type,\nthis could be the SRA depository (for NGS data), KU Leuven's own data repository (RDR),\nMendeley Data, GEO, PDB, EMDB... and, whenever possible or required, data will also be fully\nshared via the publisher's website. Scripts and code will be stored (and shared after reaching a\nfinality) via Github.\n \nNOTE ON PERSONAL DATA\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n12 of 15\nPersonal data will be pseudonymized using tools supplied by UZ Leuven. Pseudonymised\npersonal data will be stored in a password-protected Excel sheet on a secure KU Leuven server\nwith daily backup. Only investigators involved in the study will be granted access to these files.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nBIOLOGICAL MATERIAL\nA backup of critical strains will be stored in other host labs involved in the project.\n \nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nData will be stored on universities' central servers with automatic daily back-up and version\ncontrol procedures.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nNo\nBIOLOGICAL MATERIAL\nSufficient storage is available or will be installed shortly (an additional -80 °C freezer for the Van\nBambeke lab is budgeted on the project). \n \nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nOneDrive at KU Leuven or SharePoint at VUB already offers 5TB of data per user. Network\nstorage is purchased on a group level and increased whenever needed. Github space is currently\nfree of charge and only requires small volumes. External hard drives are cheap for large volumes\nand are readily available in the labs.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nBIOLOGICAL MATERIAL\n-80° freezers are currently present in the host labs (costs are covered by general lab expenses)\nor will shortly be installed (Van Bambeke lab, budgeted on the project). \n \nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nThe costs for large volume storage are covered by the project (€1000 per year).\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nBIOLOGICAL MATERIAL\nUnauthorized people do not have access to the strains.\n \nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nE-notebooks are password protected and data stored in the universities’ secure environments are\nsecured by a two factor authorization and frequently changed passwords. External HDD are\npassword-protected and stored in the safety of the labs.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll data will be retained at least for 10 years, as required by our host institutions' RDM policy.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nBIOLOGICAL MATERIAL\nAll strains will be stored for at least 10 more years after the end of the project. For this purpose, -\n80° freezers are available in the different host labs. Relevant strains will also be deposited in a\npublic repository (e.g. the Belgian Coordinated Collections of Micro-organisms (BCCM)).\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n13 of 15\nData will in first instance be stored on the universities’ central servers, and, after publication,\ndata will additionally indefinitely be stored in open access repositories (e.g. Zenodo, Mendeley\nData, KU Leuven’s RDR). Dedicated repositories will be used for specific datatypes e.g. SRA for\nNGS data. As another example, structural biology datasets will be submitted to the Protein Data\nBank (www.wwpdb.org), the Small aAngle Scattering Biological Data Bank (www.sasbdb.org) or\nthe Electron Microscopy Data Bank (www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb). The PDB provides both\nmetadata and data according to properties defined in the PDB Exchange Dictionary and the\nMacromolecular Crystallographic Information Framework (mmCIF). SASBDB is a curated\nrepository of freely accessible and fully searchable SAS experimental data, which are deposited\ntogether with the relevant experimental conditions, sample details, instrument characteristic and\nderived models. SASBDB consents to import and export data using sasCIF, an extension of core\nCrystallographic Information File for SAS. The EMDB is a public repository for electron cryo-\nmicroscopy volume maps and tomograms of macromolecular complexes and subcellular\nstructures.  Every EMDB entry has a header file containing metadata (e.g., sample, detector,\nmicroscope, image processing) describing the experiment.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nBIOLOGICAL MATERIAL\n-80° freezers are present (included in general lab costs). Deposit of biological material in public\nrepositories is generally without a fee.\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nThe costs (€99,55 per TB per year) will be covered by general lab budgets.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nNo\nAll published data will be made available at the time of publication. However, in case we identify\nvaluable IP, we will first protect commercial exploitation, either through patenting or via an MTA\nthat restricts the material from commercial use. This will be done after consulting with the\nresearch and development offices of our host institutions.\nUnpublished, essential data will be available to (future) lab members via internal IT provisions.\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nBIOLOGICAL MATERIAL\nMicrobial strains generated in this project will be made available upon simple request.\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nPublished data are likely to include CRISPRi libraries and screening results, scRNA-seq results,\ndedicated mutants, results from phenotypic analyses (awakening, (p)ppGpp levels), structural\nanalysis data, biochemical parameters, peptides/peptidomimetics, intracellular infection models.\nThese datasets will be made available via dedicated public databases (e.g. SRA, PDB, SASBDB,\nEMDB) or made available via open access repositories (e.g. Zenodo) (see above). \nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nOther (specify):\nBIOLOGICAL MATERIAL\nWe aim at communicating our results in top journals that require full disclosure of all included\ndata.

Antibiotic therapy failure and the chronic nature of UTIs can be attributed to a small fraction of transiently non-growing, antibiotic-tolerant cells called persisters. An innovative strategy to cure chronic UTIs would be to induce growth resumption in UPEC persisters, thereby re-sensitizing them to conventional antibiotics. However, our current understanding of persister awakening is far from complete, hampering the development of anti-persister drugs. The aim of this project is to study and understand awakening of UPEC persisters in individual cells up to the atomic level. To reach this goal, we have assembled a strong multi-disciplinary consortium with highly complementary expertise. We will identify novel genes and regulatory RNAs involved in awakening by single-cell RNA-seq and by screening a pooled CRISPRi library. Furthermore, we will characterize persister effectors at unprecedented detail by combining genetic, biochemical and structural approaches. Finally, in view of developing therapeutics to stimulate awakening, we will validate our findings in a collection of clinically relevant strains and a model of intracellular infection. Combined, results from this project will lead to ground-breaking new insights in persister awakening and will pave the way for the development of critically needed anti-persister drugs to effectively clear UTIs.

Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for Research and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). Be aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation. Yes This study was registered at CTC with s-number S65007 We are collecting bacterial strains from patients with suprapubic catheters that visit the hospital at regular time intervals (6 weeks). During these visits, urine samples are collected and stored at -80 °C, and patients are presented with a questionnaire inquiring about use of antibiotics, age, sex, and the date of first placement of the catheter. Later, bacterial strains are isolated from the urine samples and phenotypic analyses are performed as described in the project proposal. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant ethical review committee(s) Yes The collection of urine samples and personal information (i.e. antibiotic use, age, sex, date of placement of catheter) was approved by the Ethics Committee Research UZ/KU Leuven on March 4 2021 (reference number S65007). Note that in WP5 we propose to use either J774 cells, which are mouse macrophages, or THP-1 human monocytes or T24 ATCC® HTB-4™ cells from human bladder. The two human cell lines are commercial cells lines and no ethical approval is required for use. Does your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted? Yes Potential tech transfer will be discussed with the research and development offices of KU Leuven, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Université Catholique de Louvain, Université de Namur, University of Würzburg and VIB. Ownership of the generated data has been stipulated in a Consortium Agreement. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place? Yes Materials requested from other labs (e.g. reporters needed to perform the work described in WP4) might be subject to MTAs. This will be done in consultation with our host institutions' legal departments to minimize resistrictions on the use of these materials. 4. Documentation and metadata What documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this project? This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 11 of 15 BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL Cryotubes will be labeled with a reference number that links to an entry in our Microsoft Access Database which is hosted on a central server and accessible to all people involved in the project. All relevant information on the specific strains will be included in this database. This includes strain identifier, a clear description of how the mutants were constructed and a link to whole genome sequence if applicable. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Data will be generated following standardized protocols which are stored in a central OneNote notebook. Furthermore, an E-notebook will be used to register day-by-day activities. Raw data, history and context of experiments, protocols and analyzed data will be uploaded to this E- Notebook and backed up in the cloud. After publication or upon submission of manuscripts for publication, all datasets described in the publication will be deposited in dedicated data repositories (see below). Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used. If no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse. Yes Various data types come with their own metadata containing technical information about settings, machine types, pixel density, resolution, channels... Examples of these include .fastq NGS files containing standard metadata on sequencing technique, or .nd2 following the Nikon metadata standards. Throughout the project, these data files will be preserved with their original metadata. For .txt, .csv, .xlsx files containing tabular information, extra tabs or a head text section will be used to explain the data, the meaning of the columns etc. For others lacking a formally acknowledged metadata standard, Dublin Core Metadata will be used and a readme file will be saved in the same directory of the datafiles to explain all the various data files and give a broad overview of the analyses steps. Moreover, we will closely monitor MIBBI (Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations) for metadata standards that are more specific to our data. After publication or upon submission of manuscripts for publication, all datasets described in the publication will be deposited in data repositories (see below). Depending on the repository that is used, the metadata standard used by that specific repository will be filled in. Moreover, datasets will need to be registered in VUB’s cris system PURE, where the FOSB (Flemish Open Science Board) metadata schema is used, which is based on the Data Cite metadata standard. 5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project Where will the data be stored? BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL Cryotubes will be stored in -80° freezers with restricted access. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS An E-Notebook will be used to collect data. Low-volume data, protocols and analyses will subsequently be stored in secure and internally shared folders on university servers with built-in backup and versioning (SharePoint). Although built-in backup systems are in place, password- protected hard drives equipped with anti-virus programs will be used as backup. A network drive will also be used for large-scale data (e.g. NGS data and microscopy data). A copy of these datasets will be made to desktop PCs with large computational power (or to computing cluster of our host institutions) whenever data analyses will be performed. Structural biology data will also be stored at the synchrotron or at the VIB-VUB facility for Bio Electron Cryogenic Microscopy (BECM). For final datasets that are part of publications or manuscripts posted on preprint servers, datasets will be deposited in publicly available repositories. Depending on the data type, this could be the SRA depository (for NGS data), KU Leuven's own data repository (RDR), Mendeley Data, GEO, PDB, EMDB... and, whenever possible or required, data will also be fully shared via the publisher's website. Scripts and code will be stored (and shared after reaching a finality) via Github. NOTE ON PERSONAL DATA This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 12 of 15 Personal data will be pseudonymized using tools supplied by UZ Leuven. Pseudonymised personal data will be stored in a password-protected Excel sheet on a secure KU Leuven server with daily backup. Only investigators involved in the study will be granted access to these files. How is backup of the data provided? BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL A backup of critical strains will be stored in other host labs involved in the project. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Data will be stored on universities' central servers with automatic daily back-up and version control procedures. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will be taken care of. No BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL Sufficient storage is available or will be installed shortly (an additional -80 °C freezer for the Van Bambeke lab is budgeted on the project). EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS OneDrive at KU Leuven or SharePoint at VUB already offers 5TB of data per user. Network storage is purchased on a group level and increased whenever needed. Github space is currently free of charge and only requires small volumes. External hard drives are cheap for large volumes and are readily available in the labs. What are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these costs be covered? BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL -80° freezers are currently present in the host labs (costs are covered by general lab expenses) or will shortly be installed (Van Bambeke lab, budgeted on the project). EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The costs for large volume storage are covered by the project (€1000 per year). Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL Unauthorized people do not have access to the strains. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS E-notebooks are password protected and data stored in the universities’ secure environments are secured by a two factor authorization and frequently changed passwords. External HDD are password-protected and stored in the safety of the labs. 6. Data preservation after the FWO project Which data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...). All data will be retained at least for 10 years, as required by our host institutions' RDM policy. Where will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)? BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL All strains will be stored for at least 10 more years after the end of the project. For this purpose, - 80° freezers are available in the different host labs. Relevant strains will also be deposited in a public repository (e.g. the Belgian Coordinated Collections of Micro-organisms (BCCM)). EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 13 of 15 Data will in first instance be stored on the universities’ central servers, and, after publication, data will additionally indefinitely be stored in open access repositories (e.g. Zenodo, Mendeley Data, KU Leuven’s RDR). Dedicated repositories will be used for specific datatypes e.g. SRA for NGS data. As another example, structural biology datasets will be submitted to the Protein Data Bank (www.wwpdb.org), the Small aAngle Scattering Biological Data Bank (www.sasbdb.org) or the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb). The PDB provides both metadata and data according to properties defined in the PDB Exchange Dictionary and the Macromolecular Crystallographic Information Framework (mmCIF). SASBDB is a curated repository of freely accessible and fully searchable SAS experimental data, which are deposited together with the relevant experimental conditions, sample details, instrument characteristic and derived models. SASBDB consents to import and export data using sasCIF, an extension of core Crystallographic Information File for SAS. The EMDB is a public repository for electron cryo- microscopy volume maps and tomograms of macromolecular complexes and subcellular structures. Every EMDB entry has a header file containing metadata (e.g., sample, detector, microscope, image processing) describing the experiment. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered? BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL -80° freezers are present (included in general lab costs). Deposit of biological material in public repositories is generally without a fee. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The costs (€99,55 per TB per year) will be covered by general lab budgets. 7. Data sharing and reuse Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? No All published data will be made available at the time of publication. However, in case we identify valuable IP, we will first protect commercial exploitation, either through patenting or via an MTA that restricts the material from commercial use. This will be done after consulting with the research and development offices of our host institutions. Unpublished, essential data will be available to (future) lab members via internal IT provisions. Which data will be made available after the end of the project? BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL Microbial strains generated in this project will be made available upon simple request. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Published data are likely to include CRISPRi libraries and screening results, scRNA-seq results, dedicated mutants, results from phenotypic analyses (awakening, (p)ppGpp levels), structural analysis data, biochemical parameters, peptides/peptidomimetics, intracellular infection models. These datasets will be made available via dedicated public databases (e.g. SRA, PDB, SASBDB, EMDB) or made available via open access repositories (e.g. Zenodo) (see above). Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? Other (specify): BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL We aim at communicating our results in top journals that require full disclosure of all included data. Biological material will be shared upon simple request following publication. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We aim at communicating our results in top journals that require full disclosure upon publication of all included data, either in the main text, in supplementary material or in a data repository if requested by the journal and following deposit advice given by the journal. Depending on the journal, accessibility restrictions may apply. Proper links to these data sets will be provided in the corresponding publications. When will the data be made available? This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 14 of 15 When will the data be made available? After an embargo period. Specify the length of the embargo and why this is necessary Upon publication of the research results Unpublished data will be embargoed for public access for another 5 years to allow the research group to publish research findings. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL Biological material will be distributed to other parties if requested. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Depending on the journal: open access or standard subscription-based publication. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered? BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL Generally, shipment is paid by requesting parties. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS A budget for publication costs has been requested in this project (€45000). 8. Responsibilities Who will be responsible for data documentation & metadata? All researchers will regularly upload their data, protocols and metadata on the E-notebook and university servers, and regular back-ups will be additionally made on external hard disks (password protected and encrypted). The final responsibility for data documentation & metadata will be with the WP leaders: - Jan Michiels: WP1 and WP4 - Wim Versées WP2 - Régis Hallez: WP3 - Françoise Van Bambeke: WP5 Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?
