The F WO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official  start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel.  Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.  \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation  Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders \nand research institutions.  This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning .

The child’s  self-regulation stems from successful co -regulation between the baby  \nand its caregiver(s) and constitutes the basis of mental health.  Regulation problems (RP) in early childhood \nare the seeds for emergent  developmental psychopathology and for persistent mental health  problems  \nlater in life. Given the increasing pressur e on our mental  health care system, targeting RP at an early age is \na cost -effective  prevention strategy. Based on growing empirical and clinical evidence,  we hypothesize  \nthat child RP largely result from/persist through coregulation  difficulties within the child -parent dyad, \nwhich itself is largely  impacted by stress and regulation difficulties in the parent. Hence,  reducing stress \nand enhancing parents’ regulation abilities may be the  most optimal gateway for improving self -regulation \nin the child, ther eby preventing future mental health problems. Yet, the study of early RP is limited  \nby a lack of clear concepts, objective measures and diagnostic criteria. In  clinical contexts, professionals \noften have to rely on subjective  assessments of mother, father and child problems. Furthermore, the  \nproposed links between infant and parental self -regulation problems  have not yet been established \nempirically.  \n \nThis research project  will objectively quantify self - and co -regulation dynamics in a cohort of dysregulate d \nchildren and parents (and their matched controls), and we will follow them up throughout a clinically \nsuccessful intensive 3rd line family -based intervention program mainly focusing on parental stress \nreduction. This study is highly innovative because (1 ) we will use state -of-the-art dual measurements in a \nsample of young dysregulated psychiatric patients and families, pinpointing co -fluctuations in terms of  \nbehavioral (e.g. eye  gaze, facial mimicry, vocalizations, etc.), and stress physiology (heart rate  and skin \nconductance) attunement; (2) we will not only study mother -child pairs, but also fathers will be included in \nall these measurements; (3) we will extend these typical laboratory measurements to the home \nenvironment, across 24 -hour -long ANS  and voc alization recording sessions and 14-day-long detailed diary \nmeasures, allowing us to examine how dyadic/triadic stress physiology responses and behavioral patterns \ninterrelate in naturalistic home settings;  and (4) we will administer all these measurements  at multiple \ntime -points allowing us to investigate  postulated (directional) associations among parental stress and self - \nand co -regulation.  \n \n \n \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        4 \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        5 \n 2.

It is increasingly being demonstrated that regulation problems (RP) in childhood, due to co-regulation problems within the\nparent(s)-child relationship are extremely important for mental health and thus setting the stage for developmental pathologies and persistent\npsychological problems in later life. To date, however, there is hardly any fundamental research with the aim to intervene in this vicious circle of\nmental health problems, especially in relation to (1) the understanding the vicious circle of regulatory problems within the broader social context, and\n(2) how we can prevent and treat these regulatory problems in young children.\nThe present study will address these gaps using a fully mixed concurrent dominant status design on 3 research goals: (1) assess the prevalence and\nevolution of RP (2) define the risk and protective factors of the child and the child’s ecosystem in RP (3) investigate the impact of several stressors on\nmothers’ and fathers’ parenting and how this impacts RP in infants.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n17-01-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

It is increasingly demonstrated that regulatory problems (RP) in infancy – resulting from co -regulation difficulties \nwithin the care giver(s) -child relationship – hold extreme importance for mental health, constituting the seeds for emergent developmental \npsychopathology and persistent mental health problems later in life. However, to date, there has been limited fundamental res earch wh ich aims to \nintervene in this vicious cycle of mental health problems, especially with respect to (1) understanding the vicious cycle of regulatory problems \nwithin a larger social context and (2) exploring how to structurally prevent and treat infant regul atory problems. The current project is the third \nwork package of a large -scale FWO -project \"Supporting the development of self -regulation in young children: a promising strategy in preventive \nmental health care\". By conducting qualitative interviews and fo cus groups with parents, professional childcare workers and healthcare providers, \nthis third WP aims at identifying the missed opportunities in the preventive care trajectory for young children with RP, and investigate how the \nmechanisms of an established and clinically successful 3rd line family program can be translated to fill in the gaps within preventive infant mental \nhealth care in Flanders. We will focus on 3 research objectives to answer the research question: (1) Explore parents’ health seeking beh avior and \ncare trajectory as a response to RP, (2) Examine the perspective of professional childcare workers on RP, and (3) Examine the  views of health care \nproviders on implementing a new 0th/1st line co - and self -regulation program.  \nLast modified: 08-12-2023 \nPinpoint missed opportunities within preventive professional care for young children with RP and \ntranslate 3rd line clinical expertise to fill these gaps Application DMP  \n \nQuestionnaire  \nDescribe the datatypes (surveys, sequences, manuscripts, objects … ) the research will collect and/or generate and /or (re)us e.

The F WO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviatio ns is available via the following link.

FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 3 Please provide a short project description A major challenge of the newborn child is to learn to regulate internal states (physiological, emotional, and cognitive) and behavior. The child’s self-regulation stems from successful co -regulation between the baby and its caregiver(s) and constitutes the basis of mental health. Regulation problems (RP) in early childhood are the seeds for emergent developmental psychopathology and for persistent mental health problems later in life. Given the increasing pressur e on our mental health care system, targeting RP at an early age is a cost -effective prevention strategy. Based on growing empirical and clinical evidence, we hypothesize that child RP largely result from/persist through coregulation difficulties within the child -parent dyad, which itself is largely impacted by stress and regulation difficulties in the parent. Hence, reducing stress and enhancing parents’ regulation abilities may be the most optimal gateway for improving self -regulation in the child, ther eby preventing future mental health problems. Yet, the study of early RP is limited by a lack of clear concepts, objective measures and diagnostic criteria. In clinical contexts, professionals often have to rely on subjective assessments of mother, father and child problems. Furthermore, the proposed links between infant and parental self -regulation problems have not yet been established empirically. This research project will objectively quantify self - and co -regulation dynamics in a cohort of dysregulate d children and parents (and their matched controls), and we will follow them up throughout a clinically successful intensive 3rd line family -based intervention program mainly focusing on parental stress reduction. This study is highly innovative because (1 ) we will use state -of-the-art dual measurements in a sample of young dysregulated psychiatric patients and families, pinpointing co -fluctuations in terms of behavioral (e.g. eye gaze, facial mimicry, vocalizations, etc.), and stress physiology (heart rate and skin conductance) attunement; (2) we will not only study mother -child pairs, but also fathers will be included in all these measurements; (3) we will extend these typical laboratory measurements to the home environment, across 24 -hour -long ANS and voc alization recording sessions and 14-day-long detailed diary measures, allowing us to examine how dyadic/triadic stress physiology responses and behavioral patterns interrelate in naturalistic home settings; and (4) we will administer all these measurements at multiple time -points allowing us to investigate postulated (directional) associations among parental stress and self - and co -regulation.

It is increasingly being demonstrated that regulation problems (RP) in childhood, due to co-regulation problems within the parent(s)-child relationship are extremely important for mental health and thus setting the stage for developmental pathologies and persistent psychological problems in later life. To date, however, there is hardly any fundamental research with the aim to intervene in this vicious circle of mental health problems, especially in relation to (1) the understanding the vicious circle of regulatory problems within the broader social context, and (2) how we can prevent and treat these regulatory problems in young children. The present study will address these gaps using a fully mixed concurrent dominant status design on 3 research goals: (1) assess the prevalence and evolution of RP (2) define the risk and protective factors of the child and the child’s ecosystem in RP (3) investigate the impact of several stressors on mothers’ and fathers’ parenting and how this impacts RP in infants.

It is increasingly demonstrated that regulatory problems (RP) in infancy – resulting from co -regulation difficulties within the care giver(s) -child relationship – hold extreme importance for mental health, constituting the seeds for emergent developmental psychopathology and persistent mental health problems later in life. However, to date, there has been limited fundamental res earch wh ich aims to intervene in this vicious cycle of mental health problems, especially with respect to (1) understanding the vicious cycle of regulatory problems within a larger social context and (2) exploring how to structurally prevent and treat infant regul atory problems. The current project is the third work package of a large -scale FWO -project \"Supporting the development of self -regulation in young children: a promising strategy in preventive mental health care\". By conducting qualitative interviews and fo cus groups with parents, professional childcare workers and healthcare providers, this third WP aims at identifying the missed opportunities in the preventive care trajectory for young children with RP, and investigate how the mechanisms of an established and clinically successful 3rd line family program can be translated to fill in the gaps within preventive infant mental health care in Flanders. We will focus on 3 research objectives to answer the research question: (1) Explore parents’ health seeking beh avior and care trajectory as a response to RP, (2) Examine the perspective of professional childcare workers on RP, and (3) Examine the views of health care providers on implementing a new 0th/1st line co - and self -regulation program.
