Documentation and metadata  \n \n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template   5 \n What documentation will be provided to enable \nunderstanding and reuse of the data \ncollected/generated in this project?  In order to make sure all the data collected and stored will be reliable and reproducib le, a text  \ndocument describing the exact expe rimental conditions, including date, time, location of  \nmeasurements, instruments, sample preparation protocol and measurement parameters etc.  \nThis file will be kept in the same folder where the data is stored.  \nIn addition, data will be stored in a folder per experimental setup, the type of investigated  \nsystem and the corresponding date.  \nThe names of the files will be structured in a comprehensible way. The name of each file will  \ncontain the specific abbreviation o f the analyzed sample in the name (eg. GRXX, see section 2).  \nIn this way, by tracking the corresponding logbook/lab -book notes, each file can be easily found  \non the local computers controlling the setup and on the server of the laboratory.  \nFor the material s, a list of samples and the location where these are stored will be kept in  \nresearcher's logbook. A description of the sample's characteristics (e.g. sample name, solvent,  \nquantity, date, concentration) will be added to allow rapid identification and reus e. \nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be used.  If \nnot, state in detail which metadata will be \ncreated to make the data easy/easier to find \nand reuse.  ☐ Yes \n☒ No \nThere is no formal metadata standard. However, the standardized steps described in section 4.1  will \nensure that the data is easy to find and reuse.  \n \n \n5. Data storage & backup during the FWO project  \n \n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template   6 \n Where will the data be stored?   Data will be firstly collected and kept at the local desktops of the instruments. For analysis  \npurposes some data will also be copied on the researcher's computer and personal storages such  \nas portable hard disks. In any case, a backup copy of the raw data will be automatically made on  \nthe servers of ICTS - Standard. The data will be also backed -up in a secure server space in  \nKULAK. All the data will also be organized and saved in the researcher's personal cloud backup  \nstorage (2TB) provided by KU Leuven.  \nFor the materials, the recipients containing samples will be sealed, labelled and stored in a  \ncabinet for chemicals. Samples containing materials sensitive to environment (perovskites) will  \nbe stored in inert atmosphere or under dry nonsolvent to avoid degradation. Since perovskites  \nare also sensitive to light, they will be stored in dark recipients to avoid contact with light.  \nLaboratory notebooks will be stored in the office C754 at the Kulak campus. The content of the  \nlab-notebook will be copied in electronic lab -books with appropriate reference to the obtained  \ndata. The electronic lab -book will be  stored in a cloud service according to the GDPR of EU. The  \ndata will be backed -up in a secure server space in KULAK  \nHow will the data be backed up?  The data will be mirror stored on the university's central servers (large volume storage at ICTS)  with \nautomatic daily back -up procedures.  The produced materials will be stored for at least one year. After that \ntime, only the samples that  do not undergo degradation (not useful anymore) or of particular relevance \nwill be stored.  \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.  ☒ Yes \n☐ No \nIf no, please specify :  \nThe amount of data that will be generated i n this project should not exceed a few hundreds GBs,  \nwhich is small enough to be stored in local computers and on the data server of the laboratory.  \nThe amount of space in the cabinet used as a storage for samples is currently sufficient.  \n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template   7 \n What are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the project? How will these \ncosts be covered?  \n \nAlthough FWO has no earmarked budget at its \ndisposal to support correct research data \nmanagement, FWO allows for part of the allocated \nproject budget  to be used to cover the cost incurred.  The costs for digi tal data storage and back up are covered by the promoto r. \nThe costs for eventual extra chemical storage cabinets will be covered by the promoto r. \nData security: how will you ensure that the data \nare securely sto red and not accessed or \nmodified by unauthorized persons?  The identifiable data files from this project will be managed, processed, and stored in a sec ure \nenvironment. The data transfer with the ICTS - Standard Storage Solutions provided by KU  \nLeuven is done over an encrypted connection. The data is encrypted with a 256 -bit SSL.  \nThe place where the materials are stored is only open to the IRF members via  badge access.  \n \n6. Data preservation  after the end of the FWO project  \nFWO expects that data generated during the project are retained for a period of minimally 5 years after the end of the projec t, in as far as legal and \ncontractual agreements allow.  \n \nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 \nyear period after the end of the project? In case \nonly a selection of the data can/will be \npreserved, clearly state the reasons  for this \n(legal or contractual restrictions, physical \npreservation issues, ...).  All data will be stored in ICTS - Standard Storage Solutions provided by KU Leuven (with  \nautomatic backup procedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU L euven RDM policy unless  \nthere will be legal or contractual restrictions in the case of tech transfer or valorisation events.  \nClose consultation with LRD and ICTS will be conducted in those cases to ensure IP and data  \nsecurity.  \nFor materials, only the sampl es that preserve their original physical and chemical properties will  \nbe retained after the end of the project. Samples that have unstable properties, meant to be use  \nfor a limited number of experiments or for limited lifetime will not be preserved or pres erved for  \nat least 1 year after the preparation depending on the case.  \nWhere will these data be archived (= stored for \nthe long term)?  The data will be archived on the university's large volume storage servers (with automatic  \nbackup procedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.  \nThe mate rials will be stored in special designed laboratory cabinets, in the case of stable  \nsamples.  \n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template   8 \n What are the expected costs for data \npreservation during these 5 years?
