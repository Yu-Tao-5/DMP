Numerical data are collected in Excel, .d format, .mzXML format, FCS file format and RData. Textual data are generated in pdf, txt, and word format. Raw output data of luciferase reporter assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays will be collected in Excel files. FACS assays will generate data structured in FCS file format, containing the acquired raw data and experiment-specific metadata. Mass spectrometry assays will generate raw data in. d format compatible with MassHunter software, which will be used for data acquisition and conversion in .mzXML format. Research methods and practices (SOPs) are fully documented. All data, raw and processed, will be named in a correct and clear way according to predefined folder structures, so data can be easily identified and reused. When wet lab techniques, scripts, algorithms and software tools are finalized, they are additionally described in manuscripts and/or on GitHub. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: Metadata from in vitro analyses (autoantibody research and metabolomics) are automatically generated by the equipment used (Gyros automated ELISA and scimaX Bruker respectively. Furthermore, metadata files containing information connecting sample IDs with lab samples and patient IDs will be carefully collected and stored in digital logs (.xls) 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10Where will the data be stored? Data will be stored in a secured, password protected servers of UZ Leuven, within a shared C://folder of the research group. UZ Leuven servers are backed-up automatically on a daily basis. There is sufficient storage and back-up capacity on all used servers All patient samples will be stored in UZ Leuven in labelled tubes in -20°C or -80°C freezers purchased by own funding. The samples will be registered and handled according to the UZ Leuven Biobank guidelines. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.6 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.See question above. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: see question ‘where will the data be stored?’ If no, please specify: 6 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7Observational clinical patient information as well as metabolomics and proteomics data and associated pseudonymized patient/clinical information is considered sensitive information and will be handled as such. The data generated in this project will be processed and stored on the UZ Leuven IT infrastructure which are protected by a genuine user authentication system relying on username and password. Access to the data as well as the access level will be limited on a project need and individual basis. Only the researchers working on the project have access to these data. Due to the sample labelling as protective measure, the researchers are not able to decipher the identity of the donor. The coding key to patient information of linked pseudonymized data does not carry any personal identifiers and all records containing the identity of each participant will be kept private and confidential. The coding key will be kept by the PI, ICU physician prof. dr. Joost Wauters What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?No additional costs are required for data storage during the project, since existing infrastructure of UZ and KU Leuven can be used. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All electronical data collected in the two first work packages of this FWO project will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project. All (remaining) biological samples are preserved for 50 years, in accordance with the guidelines of Biobank UZ/KU Leuven. The output of the analyzed datasets and the models will also be retained. Processed datasets, including cleaned and analyzed data, as well as intermediate data generated during data processing pipelines, will be retained. Comprehensive documentation, including project plans, data dictionaries, codebooks, and metadata, will be explained on the manuscript that will be uploaded in Lirias. Source code and algorithms used for data analysis and modeling will be preserved to ensure reproducibility of the results. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?Data will be stored in the UZ Leuven Large Volume Storage (100 GB, hourly backups, additional storage possible). What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?No additional costs are expected. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 136.

THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.Data will be made available upon reasonable request and upon publication of research results in peer- reviewed scientific journals. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 7 Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse, and will be conform to community norms. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication or an ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. A CC-BY license will be opted for when possible. For data shared directly by the PI (and approval of the 3rd party if necessary), a material transfer agreement (and a non-disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes: 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 15What are the expected costs for data sharing?
