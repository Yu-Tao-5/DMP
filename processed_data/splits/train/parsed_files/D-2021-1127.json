MSA  \nis a rare disease with an unknown cause, but it is hypothesized that MSA could be influenced by environmental  \ntriggers that increase disease risk. The prodromal involvement of the urogenital system and the high susceptibility of  \nMSA  patients  to develop  recurrent  urinary tract infections  has  led  to the idea  that  MSA  could  be triggered  \nperipherally via bacterial infections. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that infections or inflammation in  \nvisceral organs can trigger synucleinopathy leading to brain pathology related to MSA. I will identify and characterize  \nthe pathogen-related triggers that impact MSA pathogenesis and study the interaction of the peripheral immune  \nsystem on brain pathology. By identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying disease triggers, I will also develop a  \nnovel drug  screening method  that  focuses  on  inhibiting  and  preventing  downstream  pathogenic events. The  \noutcome of this project could lead to i) a better understanding of how MSA originates, ii) how MSA progression can  \nbe influenced, iii) the identification of new disease targets and iv) the development of innovative therapies for MSA  \nand related synucleinopathies\nInstitution: KU Leuven\nDMP_11F6921N_Melina Hehl_v1 Page 2 of 91.
