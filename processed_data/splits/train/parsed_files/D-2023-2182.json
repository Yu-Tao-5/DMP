The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Stéphane Symons 0000-0003-0091-7815\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Till Grohmann 0000-0002-7662-3787, Co-PI\nProject number 1 & title  G030023N THE FRANKFURT SCHOOL MEETS PHENOMENOLOGY: WALTER BENJAMIN AND \nHUSSERLIAN THOUGHT\nFunder(s) GrantID 2\nAffiliation(s) x KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

It reconstructs the position of one of its most prominent members, Walter Benjamin, in a crucial \nphilosophical debate of his time: the debate with Husserlian phenomenology.  \nThe project combines a historical and a systematic approach. It argues that Husserlian phenomenology was an \nimportant interlocutor for the development of Benjamin ’s thought and that it helps us to better understand its central \nconcerns. For this reason, the project analyses both the phenomenological sources that were explicitly referred to by \nBenjamin and relevant sources that were most likely unknown to him. It goes beyond the writings of Benjamin and \nHusserl themselves and also focuses on the relevant writings of Husserl's disciples (including but not limited to \nHeidegger, Héring and the Munich and Göttingen circle).\nThe project is structured around four thematic strands: knowledge, language, ideas and essences, and history. This \nwill enable a systematic elaboration of the shared research interests of Benjamin and Husserlian phenomenology.\nThe project will result in a thorough reconstruction of a foundational debate in continental thought, and a better \nunderstanding of both Benjamin's writings and phenomenology.  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 42.Research Data Summary\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 5List and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.
