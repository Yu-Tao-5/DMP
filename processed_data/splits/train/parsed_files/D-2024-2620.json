The F WO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official  start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check.   \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor -spokesperson through FWO’s e -portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first ver sion. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel.  Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.  \nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation  Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders \nand research institutions.  This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning . To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary  of definitions and abbreviatio ns is \navailable via the following link.  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        2 \n 1.

Therefore,  \nproviding citizens with high -quality public transport is evident to build and maintain liveable cities. \nTo accommodate dispersed passengers' demand, integrated public transport systems, combining \non-dema nd bus with fixed public transport systems, are required . Even though research on these \nintegrated systems is still in its infancy today, these syste ms are mostly optimized from an \noperational perspective, i.e. the fixed public transport net work is assumed  to be given and \nunchangeable, while the on -demand service is optimized. With the idea to improve passenger trips \neven more, integrated public transport should also be optimized fro m a strategical perspective, by \nrethinking the design of the fixed transpor t system given the existen ce of an on -demand bus service. \nThe aim of this project is to holistically optimize urban public t ransport and to acknowledge the \ninterdependencies of both systems. In addition, we will bring integrate d mobility closer to reality by \nusing instances based on real -world data. During this project, we wi ll develop heuristic algorithms \nand use datamining techniques to make managerial recommendati ons and build rules of thumb to \nassist cities and regions in optimizing their public transpo rt service.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)   - Version KU Leuven        4 \n 2.
