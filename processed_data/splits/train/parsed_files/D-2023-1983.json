Given the simultaneous involvement of\nnumerous genetic factors, and the difficulty to identify the relevant genes affected by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), it has\nbeen notoriously difficult to define the most critical pathways for further functional testing. In this proposal I will use novel technology to define, in a\nhigh throughput and unbiased manner, which GWASassociated genes cause risk in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and how their functional and complex\ngenetic interactions are shaped. The most recent GWAS of PD identified 90 risk variants across 78 genomic loci. I will use to a novel dual CRISPR\ninhibition/activation tool that I recently developed to up- and downregulate combinations of genes associated with these GWAS signals in human\ndopaminergic neurons, the preferentially affected cell type in PD. I will then use a combination of CROPseq and CITEseq to correlate these gene\ncombinations in a high throughput manner to the levels of \nα\nSynuclein, that is a major hallmark of PD. I will focus on gene combinations that lower \nα\n-\nSynuclein abundance as those are expected to be protective, and conduct molecular work that my host lab is proficient in to define the causative\npathways. This project takes a conceptual new approach and brings functional insight into GWAS and complex human genetic interactions in a\nmajor neurodegenerative disease.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n02-07-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

At the\nsecond level, these folders contain subfolders per experiment type (eg. western blotting, ERG, EM, immunofluorescence,...). At the third level,\nthese folders contain subfolders per individual experiment (with date indication, see below). Each of these experiment folders contain\nsubfolders for raw data, processed data, and analysed data.\nDigital files and folders of individual experiments will be named following a standard naming convention. All file names in a given dataset\nwill follow the same format: they will start with the date, followed by the project acronym, a concise descriptive name, and an optional version\nnumber. Whenever possible, names will be kept under 32 characters, containing only letters, numbers, and underscores. Dots will only be used\nfor version control indicators (minor revisions indicated by decimal numbers, and major revisions by whole numbers):\n YYYYMMDD_Project_Experiment_ version.format. Similarly, folder naming for individual experiments follows the following structure:\nYYYYMMDD(_Project)_Experiment\nData will be accompanied by documentation containing all contextual and descriptive features of the research data, which allow to understand\nand (re)use the data. Detailed procedures of each experiment are logged in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook), with reference of\neach experiment to the directory path of the folder containing raw and analysed data files. This also includes data collection methods,\nprotocols, and code explanation. Documentation is stored at the study- and the data-level, providing data provenance from the original source\ndata to specific datasets linked to publications.

The most recent GWAS of PD identified 90 risk variants across 78 genomic loci. I will use to a novel dual CRISPR inhibition/activation tool that I recently developed to up- and downregulate combinations of genes associated with these GWAS signals in human dopaminergic neurons, the preferentially affected cell type in PD. I will then use a combination of CROPseq and CITEseq to correlate these gene combinations in a high throughput manner to the levels of α Synuclein, that is a major hallmark of PD. I will focus on gene combinations that lower α - Synuclein abundance as those are expected to be protective, and conduct molecular work that my host lab is proficient in to define the causative pathways. This project takes a conceptual new approach and brings functional insight into GWAS and complex human genetic interactions in a major neurodegenerative disease.

Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). The organisation of research data follows a hierarchical folder structure based on model organism (eg. flies/mice/hamsters/cells). At the second level, these folders contain subfolders per experiment type (eg. western blotting, ERG, EM, immunofluorescence,...). At the third level, these folders contain subfolders per individual experiment (with date indication, see below). Each of these experiment folders contain subfolders for raw data, processed data, and analysed data. Digital files and folders of individual experiments will be named following a standard naming convention. All file names in a given dataset will follow the same format: they will start with the date, followed by the project acronym, a concise descriptive name, and an optional version number. Whenever possible, names will be kept under 32 characters, containing only letters, numbers, and underscores. Dots will only be used for version control indicators (minor revisions indicated by decimal numbers, and major revisions by whole numbers): YYYYMMDD_Project_Experiment_ version.format. Similarly, folder naming for individual experiments follows the following structure: YYYYMMDD(_Project)_Experiment Data will be accompanied by documentation containing all contextual and descriptive features of the research data, which allow to understand and (re)use the data. Detailed procedures of each experiment are logged in the electronic laboratory notebook (E-notebook), with reference of each experiment to the directory path of the folder containing raw and analysed data files. This also includes data collection methods, protocols, and code explanation. Documentation is stored at the study- and the data-level, providing data provenance from the original source data to specific datasets linked to publications. Data will be generated following standardized protocols. Clear and detailed descriptions of these protocols will be stored in our lab protocol database and E-notebook. Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the E- notebook and/or in hard copy lab notebooks that refer to specific datasets.

Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Digital data Digital data Primary storage for active digital files will be on KU Leuven servers. KU Leuven offers fast (\"J-drive) and slower (\"L-drive\") storage that allows reading/writing/modification of non-confidential, confidential, and strictly confidential data. KU Leuven further offers the ManGO platform for storage and management of large volumes of active research data. This platform allows secure storage, manual and automated metadata coupling, data workflows, and file sharing. Data that is no longer active, can be archived on the KU Leuven K-drive, which allows reading of non-confidential, confidential, and strictly confidential data. Physical samples Physical samples Cell lines: Human cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid nitrogen storage and will be deposited in the UZ Leuven-KU Leuven Biobank. Animal cell lines will be stored in liquid nitrogen of the laboratory. Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacterial glycerol stock (-80°C). All published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will take care of vector storage and shipping upon request. Bacterial strains will be stored in a -80°C freezer. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 02 July 2024 8 of 11 KU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme: - data stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept. - data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept. - data stored in ManGO: Snapshots are made at regular intervals (hourly, daily and monthly) in case data needs to be recovered. The data itself is synchronized on two separate hardware storage systems, each 6 PB large, located at Leuven and at Heverlee (ICTS). The data is protected against calamities at either site by synchronizing it in real-time at hardware level. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project?
