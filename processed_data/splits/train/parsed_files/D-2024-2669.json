Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nWhere will the data be stored?\nCode will be stored in KU Leuven Gitlab repositories. All datasets, documentation and metadata will be stored on the research group L-drive\nwithin the secure KU Leuven environment. Access to this drive is limited to the PI and involved researchers.\nCode and datasets used locally will be maximally stored in the KU Leuven Onedrive (provided for each staff member). Any changes or\nupdates will be uploaded weekly to the L-drive and KU Leuven Gitlab.\nIn case data is linked to publications, it will be also made available on public databases which have their own storage facilities.\nBiological data, comprising bacterial and viral strains and DNA constructs, are stored in freezers (-20°C and -80°C) present in the laboratory.\nThe samples are labelled and time-stamped, allowing easily track back in lab books and in databases of the corresponding freezers.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nHow will the data be backed up?\nKU Leuven provides automatic backup for their L-drives. Automatic version management occurs when storing data in the KU Leuven\ndatacenters. \"Snapshot\" technology is used for version management, which keeps the previous versions of the changed file online on the same\nstorage system. Additionally, KU Leuven mirrors these files to a second ICTS data center to enabledisaster recovery in case of problems. Files\nare versioned once a day, and version are kept for 14 days. KU Leuven Gitlab ensures automatic backups, and all file versions are permanently\nstored.\nFor important biological data, a back-up sample will be made and stored in a second -80°C freezer present in the laboratory.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nOur research group currently has an L-drive with a capacity of 5 TB for research. This should be sufficient for storage of the generated\ndatasets. In case of capacity problems, the L-drive capacity can be expanded or data can be stored on the KU Leuven OneDrive for staff (4\nTB).\nSufficient storage capacity for physical samples in both -20°C and -80°C freezers, as well as temporary storage at 4°C, is available in the\nlaboratory.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nThe storage facilities of KU Leuven ensure secure storage of data, with restricted access control. Only specific lab members will have access to\nthe shared folder, unauthorized persons do not have access to this system.\nA badge system allows only access to the laboratory for authorized people.\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). All experimental, generated data and how it was processed is tracked using digital journals/lab books, which are kept on university-secured network drives. Both lab books and data are time-stamped, allowing to easily trace back (experimental) details of the corresponding data. Created using DMPonline.be.

Yes Metadata will follow the standards of the relevant repositories (will be added in due time). Data published in or as supplement of open-access peer-reviewed publications will conform to the standards of the publisher. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Code will be stored in KU Leuven Gitlab repositories. All datasets, documentation and metadata will be stored on the research group L-drive within the secure KU Leuven environment. Access to this drive is limited to the PI and involved researchers. Code and datasets used locally will be maximally stored in the KU Leuven Onedrive (provided for each staff member). Any changes or updates will be uploaded weekly to the L-drive and KU Leuven Gitlab. In case data is linked to publications, it will be also made available on public databases which have their own storage facilities. Biological data, comprising bacterial and viral strains and DNA constructs, are stored in freezers (-20°C and -80°C) present in the laboratory. The samples are labelled and time-stamped, allowing easily track back in lab books and in databases of the corresponding freezers. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? KU Leuven provides automatic backup for their L-drives. Automatic version management occurs when storing data in the KU Leuven datacenters. \"Snapshot\" technology is used for version management, which keeps the previous versions of the changed file online on the same storage system. Additionally, KU Leuven mirrors these files to a second ICTS data center to enabledisaster recovery in case of problems. Files are versioned once a day, and version are kept for 14 days. KU Leuven Gitlab ensures automatic backups, and all file versions are permanently stored. For important biological data, a back-up sample will be made and stored in a second -80°C freezer present in the laboratory. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Our research group currently has an L-drive with a capacity of 5 TB for research. This should be sufficient for storage of the generated datasets. In case of capacity problems, the L-drive capacity can be expanded or data can be stored on the KU Leuven OneDrive for staff (4 TB). Sufficient storage capacity for physical samples in both -20°C and -80°C freezers, as well as temporary storage at 4°C, is available in the laboratory. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The storage facilities of KU Leuven ensure secure storage of data, with restricted access control. Only specific lab members will have access to the shared folder, unauthorized persons do not have access to this system. A badge system allows only access to the laboratory for authorized people.

What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The L-drive storage has a yearly cost of 104,42/TB/year and is covered by the research group. Storage for more than 5 years after the project can be covered by the research group/department. 4.

In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). institutional policies...). All digital data, that is not already deposited in a public repository, will be preserved and will remain available for members of the labs involved in this project. Important biological samples (e.g. engineered bacterial and viral strains, specific plasmids) will be stored in -20°C/-80°C freezers available in the laboratory. Other biological materials (e.g. primers, intermediates, unfinished products) will be discarded during and at the end of the project due to limited storage capacity in the long-term storage freezers. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Digital data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. Specific long-term storage freezers (-20°C and -80°C) are available in the laboratory. Biological sample details will be listed in databases, which are stored on the university's central server.
