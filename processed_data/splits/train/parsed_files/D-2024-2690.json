Despite this, Emmanuel Falque dismisses ontotheology and aims to\nphilosophize beyond its specter. In this project, I aim to explore to what extent Emmanuel Falque has absolved himself from the perils of Ontotheology\nthrough different phases of his work. This leads to a hermeneutical theological exploration that programmatically takes place through Falque’s works,\nstarting from his treatment of the doctrine of the Incarnation in his Triduum Philosophique, his treatment of ontotheology, specifically in the works of\nBonaventure, his treatment of the theme of alterity in patristic and medieval theologians, and finally the implications he draws for the relationship\nbetween philosophy and theology. Through a hermeneutical theological examination of Falque’s works, the project aims to expose the theological pre-\nunderstandings that Falque brings to his phenomenological readings and subsequently clarify ontotheological problems in his texts. In doing so, the\nproject uncovers a new paradigm through which ontotheology can be understood and dealt with anew. Consequently, the project draws implications of\nthis new paradigm for philosophical theology and the philosophy\nand phenomenology of religious experience.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n23-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
