GSMs spare essential GSEC-mediated signalling cascades. \nSpecifically, they increase the efficiency of the sequential Aβ processing along one or both GSEC product lines by \nstabilizing GSEC-Aβn interactions10 and preventing the premature dissociation and release of longer Aβs13. As a \nresult, GSMs enhance the cleavage of longer and toxic Aβ42 and Aβ43 into shorter Aβ37 and Aβ38 peptides. These \nshorter Aβs have been shown to be non-toxic, or even attenuate the Aβ toxicity in vivo in the Drosophila eye. Of \nnote, recent clinical studies have linked increased CSF Aβ38 levels to slower cognitive decline in AD patients. These \nfindings collectively indicate that the mechanism of action of GSMs is inherently safe and support the notion that \nGSM-based therapy might be beneficial, at least for AD prevention. we propose that generating solid structural and \nmechanistic understanding of GSM-GSECAPP (drug-target) interactions will facilitate structure-based discovery of \nchemically diverse scaffolds securing GSEC-APP complexes and thereby lowering production of longer and toxic Aβ \npeptides. These novel scaffolds can then serve as valuable lead compounds in the development of next-generation \nGSMs (acting as GSEC stabilizers)selectively and potently targeting APP processing.\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

GSMs spare essential GSEC-mediated signalling cascades. Specifically, they increase the efficiency of the sequential Aβ processing along one or both GSEC product lines by stabilizing GSEC-Aβn interactions10 and preventing the premature dissociation and release of longer Aβs13. As a result, GSMs enhance the cleavage of longer and toxic Aβ42 and Aβ43 into shorter Aβ37 and Aβ38 peptides. These shorter Aβs have been shown to be non-toxic, or even attenuate the Aβ toxicity in vivo in the Drosophila eye. Of note, recent clinical studies have linked increased CSF Aβ38 levels to slower cognitive decline in AD patients. These findings collectively indicate that the mechanism of action of GSMs is inherently safe and support the notion that GSM-based therapy might be beneficial, at least for AD prevention. we propose that generating solid structural and mechanistic understanding of GSM-GSECAPP (drug-target) interactions will facilitate structure-based discovery of chemically diverse scaffolds securing GSEC-APP complexes and thereby lowering production of longer and toxic Aβ peptides. These novel scaffolds can then serve as valuable lead compounds in the development of next-generation GSMs (acting as GSEC stabilizers)selectively and potently targeting APP processing. 1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

It includes digital and physical data and encompasses the whole spectrum ranging from raw data to processed and analysed data including analysis scripts and code. Physical data are all materials that need proper management because they are valuable, difficult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated. Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and presentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentation/metadata. RDM Guidance on data If you reuse existing data, please specify the source, preferably by using a persistent identifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per dataset or data type. We will reuse part of the physical datasets that were generated in our laboratory in previous projects, such as bacteria strains, mammalian cell lines and vectors for expression. These datasets are included as part of the Experimental dataset 1, 2, 3 as described above. We will also reuse part of the digital datasets that were generated in our laboratory in previous projects (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-022-01518-6 , https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2022111084 , https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.09.556900 ) as well as published such as Cryo – EM structural data. These datasets are included as part of Experimental dataset 7 and described above.

FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No There is sufficient storage and back-up capacity on all KU Leuven servers: - The “L-drive” is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster with NetApp eseries storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front-end. - The “J-drive” is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controlers with an Ontap 9.1P9 operating system. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research dataSecurity of digital datasets in KU Leuven drives: Both the “L-drive” and “J-drive” servers are accessible only by laboratory members, and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. Security of the physical datasets that are stored in the laboratory unit are ensured by allowing access only to the laboratory members through KU Leuven ID card access. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?The total cost of data storage during the project is projected to be max. 15 000 € per year. This includes the following costs: The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 174 € /TB per year for the “L-drive” and 519 € /TB per year for the “J-drive” and 17.7 €/TB per year for data tape storage. These costs will be covered by the VIB dotation budget assigned to the laboratory of Lucía Chávez-Gutiérrez. 5.
