Henipaviruses have been\nisolated from Pteropus fruit bats across Oceania, Asia, and Africa. Due to climate change and other factors, these areas will likely expand and enhance\nspillover events. Despite the high risk of a future henipavirus pandemic and the high case-mortality rate, no treatment is available for human use,\nindicating the urgent need for research and development. One major hurdle in henipavirus research and drug discovery is the requirement for a BSL-4\nfacility. As such, the discovery of a nonpathogenic henipavirus, Cedar virus (CedV), presents an opportunity to conduct henipavirus research in a non-\nBSL-4 facility. This project aims to establish a proficient and validated drug discovery and development pipeline for henipaviruses through a multi-\ndisciplinary approach. To this end, we will develop in vitro and in vivo models, using CedV, which will promote the identification of small-molecule\ninhibitors of henipavirus replication. Moreover, these inhibitors will be used as tool compounds to identify druggable targets in the replication\nmachinery of CedV, and contribute to the understanding of henipavirus replication. The outcomes of this PhD project will greatly contribute to\nhenipavirus research and pave the way for the first antiviral drugs to treat and/or prevent henipaviral infection in humans, thereby increasing global\npandemic preparedness.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n26-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Myself (Laura Vandemaele) and my supervisor Professor Johan\nNeyts has access to our OneDrive folders and will keep them for as long as necessary, and for a minimum of 5 years. Laura Vandemaele\nand Johan Neyts are the responsible people for data preservation and can be contacted by the FWO with questions of long-term\npreservation of the data. After finishing the PhD project, the folders are archived on our shared driver.

Our Onedrive has automatic back-up procedures to ensure that my data is not lost. For long term\nstorage/archive we use a shared drive with automatic back-up procedures, maintained by the ICTS managers of the Rega institute. As far\nas storage capacity is concerned Onedrive has a 2 terabyte storage capacity which is more than enough for the data sets that I am storing\nas most files are between 1-\n100 MB. All my data will also be backed up to the shared drive which also contains back-up procedures (managed by ICTS) and has a\nvery high storage capacity if necessary. Finally our Onedrive has a strong security policy for data storage with a multifactor\nauthentication system ensuring the safety of our data. The shared drive is also very well secured by the ICTS managers of the Rega\nInstitute.

Henipaviruses have been isolated from Pteropus fruit bats across Oceania, Asia, and Africa. Due to climate change and other factors, these areas will likely expand and enhance spillover events. Despite the high risk of a future henipavirus pandemic and the high case-mortality rate, no treatment is available for human use, indicating the urgent need for research and development. One major hurdle in henipavirus research and drug discovery is the requirement for a BSL-4 facility. As such, the discovery of a nonpathogenic henipavirus, Cedar virus (CedV), presents an opportunity to conduct henipavirus research in a non- BSL-4 facility. This project aims to establish a proficient and validated drug discovery and development pipeline for henipaviruses through a multi- disciplinary approach. To this end, we will develop in vitro and in vivo models, using CedV, which will promote the identification of small-molecule inhibitors of henipavirus replication. Moreover, these inhibitors will be used as tool compounds to identify druggable targets in the replication machinery of CedV, and contribute to the understanding of henipavirus replication. The outcomes of this PhD project will greatly contribute to henipavirus research and pave the way for the first antiviral drugs to treat and/or prevent henipaviral infection in humans, thereby increasing global pandemic preparedness.

Myself (Laura Vandemaele) and my supervisor Professor Johan Neyts has access to our OneDrive folders and will keep them for as long as necessary, and for a minimum of 5 years. Laura Vandemaele and Johan Neyts are the responsible people for data preservation and can be contacted by the FWO with questions of long-term preservation of the data. After finishing the PhD project, the folders are archived on our shared driver. They will stay there for a minimum of 10 years. 2 . For storage of all our data we use cloud software (OneDrive, using a KULeuven license) for short to midterm storage and to share files with team members and collaborators. Our Onedrive has automatic back-up procedures to ensure that my data is not lost. For long term storage/archive we use a shared drive with automatic back-up procedures, maintained by the ICTS managers of the Rega institute. As far as storage capacity is concerned Onedrive has a 2 terabyte storage capacity which is more than enough for the data sets that I am storing as most files are between 1- 100 MB. All my data will also be backed up to the shared drive which also contains back-up procedures (managed by ICTS) and has a very high storage capacity if necessary. Finally our Onedrive has a strong security policy for data storage with a multifactor authentication system ensuring the safety of our data. The shared drive is also very well secured by the ICTS managers of the Rega Institute. Myself (Laura Vandemaele) as well as my supervisor Professor Johan Neyts have access to this data.

Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). Daily labwork (protocols, calculations, results,…) will be documented in an online OneNote labbook which is continuously being backed up by KU Leuven servers. Additionally, original files with raw data and files with analysed data will be labelled and stored on servers controlled and backed up by the KU Leuven IT department. The results of the experiment are also saved in our Onedrive server for data safety, for easy comparison between experiments and so our team members and collaborators can easily access the information. For each experiment a protocol is prepared in excel containing: 1. An introduction section with background information about the experiment. 2. An experimental section explaining clearly every step of the experimental process and noting any variation in the conditions of the experiment at any point, as well as dates, incubation times, cell densities and any other detail necessary for experimental reproducibility 3. A results sheet depicting all the results of the experiment in detail 4.

Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? All data will be stored on drives controlled and backed up by KU Leuven. Data with small volumes will be stored on the J drive, in a subfolder that can only be accessed by personnel of the Neyts lab. Data with large volumes (microscopy images) will be stored on the L drive of our team. For long term storage/archive: we use a shared K-drive with automatic back-up procedures of KU Leuven, maintained by the ICTS managers of the Rega institute. Biological samples from experiments will be stored in freezers and registered in https://freezerpro.rega How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? The data will be stored on KU Leuven central servers (J/K/L drives). A back-up of the data on these drives will automatically be generated two times per day.

If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes All data with small volumes will be stored on the J drive controlled by KU Leuven. There is sufficient storage space foreseen (1.4 Tb) and this is constantly monitored by KU Leuven IT services. Data with larger volumes will be stored on a specifically allocated L drive of KU Leuven on which sufficient storage space is foreseen (10 TB) and which is also constantly monitored by KU Leuven IT services. The separate K-drive of KU Leuven will be used for long term storage of files and data from finished projects (200 GB).
