Recordings from intracranial micro-electrodes will be combined with microstimulation to\nstudy the functional network underlying image and action processing, as well as the influence of\nreward computation and working memory load on decision-making. We complement microscale\ninvestigations with fMRI to integrate our findings in a larger network perspective.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. Data Description\nWhat data will you collect or create?
