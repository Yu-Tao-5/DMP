Kreinecker\nDescription\n The 1Cor-project examines the text, the transmission and the translations of the\napostle Paulâ€™s first letter to the Corinthians in its earliest attainable textual forms. As one of\nthe oldest writings of the New Testament 1Cor has influenced the development and shape of\nChristian communities up to the present. Despite its centrality to Christianity, critical editions of\nthe text based on the vast amount of manuscript evidence extant today are still lacking. The\nprojectâ€™s aim is to produce digital text-critical editions and studies of 1Cor, including the\nGreek Editio Critica Maior and the Vetus Latina which will replace century-old editions from the\n18th and 19th century. With specifically designed digital tools and cutting-edge methodology the\nproject processes and evaluates the manuscript tradition of 1Cor on a larger scale than has ever\nbeen possible. The projectâ€™s studies are based on over 150 biblical manuscripts, over 44.000\nquotations of the text in Early Christian writings and translations of the Greek text into Latin,\nCoptic, Syriac, Gothic and Arabic. With its unique and innovative multilingual perspective, the\nproject offers new insights into the transmission and history of 1Cor across languages and\ncultures. The project will provide the standard scholarly text of 1Cor for generations to come,\nwhich will also function as the base text for future translations into modern languages and will\nthus be read and studied by millions all around the world.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes The following backup regime in place on the server used to generate the data at the University of Birmingham. 1) At 5pm every day an incremental back up is taken of everything that has changed since 5pm the previous day. 2) At 5pm every Friday a full back up is taken. 3) These backups are stored electronically on site for 3 weeks after which they are transferred to tape and shipped offsite where they are kept for at least a year.

Local machines will be backed up using external hard drives. What are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these costs be covered? No additional storage is required beyond that already provided so no direct costs will be incurred. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?

The docker imagine containing the working database used to complete the CBGM can be archived in dockerhub and possible also on the NTVMR as part of a digital edition. Other external repositories will also be considered during the course of the project. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered? These services are already provided by the collaborating institutions. The volume of the data generated is not expected to exceed the capacity provided by the collaborating institutions free of charge. 7.

In an Open Access repository When will the data be made available? Immediately after the end of the project The transcriptions may be made available when they are ready rather than just at the end of the project. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? All data will be released with a CC-BY license and therefore available to anyone for any purpose as long as credit is given to the creators. What are the expected costs for data sharing?
