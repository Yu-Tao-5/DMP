This project, focusing on the large available mass of end-of-life polyolefins, aims at\nselective oxidation of these hydrocarbon-type materials. As a first option, alcohol (and ketone)\ngroups are created along the polyolefin chain. For this, selective Ti-containing zeolites and clean\noxidants (e.g. hydrogen peroxide) are applied at mild temperatures, avoiding the adverse\naspects of free radical autoxidations. Polyolefins with a small degree of hydroxylation offer great\nperspectives, e.g. regarding coatability, while preserving most attractive properties of the\noriginal polyolefins. Secondly, the ketone groups on the polyolefins are further converted to in-\nchain esters via a Baeyer-Villiger reaction. Such reaction is enabled by Sn-doped zeolites, using\nagain peroxides. This results in polyethylene-derived polyesters, with attractive new properties\nlike easy degradation by chemolysis, or even self-healing. For both major reaction types, the\narchitecture of the zeolites is adapted to deal with the polymeric nature of the dissolved\nreactants. Catalyst-polymer interactions are studied in detail, also to facilitate recovery and\nreuse of the heterogeneous catalysts. Finally, key characteristics of the isolated reaction\nproducts (e.g. functionalization, thermal and structural properties) are recorded to facilitate\nfuture market adoption of these new materials.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. General Information\nName applicant\nRobin Lemmens\nFWO Project Number & Title\n1S85822N\nCatalytic upgrading of polyolefins via oxygenation and in-chain ester formation using Ti and Sn\nzeolite catalysts\nAffiliation\nKU Leuven\n2. Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nProcedures for performing reactions, for synthesizing catalysts and initial observations of these\nexperiments will be gathered. Such procedures will also result in raw data files containing\nchromatographic data (GC-FID, GC-MS) and material characterization data (XRD, physisorption\nand chemisorption data or spectroscopic analysis via UV-Vis, NMR etc.). These will be processed\nin excel files, summaries and presentations, finally culminating in manuscripts and/or patents.\nThe combined virtual volume of these datasets will be limited (< 10 GB), and will consist mostly\nof data files containing GC chromatograms (up to 5 GB).\nExamples:\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 4\nType of data\nFormat\nVolume\nHow created\nX-ray\ndiffractaction\npatterns\n.xrdml\n20 kB\nXRD spectroscopy\nof synthesized\ncatalysts\nUV-vis spectra\n.csv\n< 1 MB\nUV-Vis\nspectropscopy of\nsynthesized\ncatalysts\nGC\nchromatograms\n .gcd\n< 2 MB\nGC analysis of\nworked-up\nreaction samples\nNMR spectra\n /\n256 kB\nNMR spectroscopy\nof synthesized\nproducts\n3.

If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nNo\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nYes\nThe methods and reactor configurations developed in this project have potential for valorization,\nwhich will be subjected for discussion during the project. Patents will be submitted, transferred\nand valorized with the assistance of the intellectual property unit of KU Leuven Research &\nDevelopment (LRD).\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nDetails to reproduce reaction procedures are described in a personal lab booklet. Upon\npresentation or publication of data, procedures are described in sufficient detail to enable a\nreproduction of the generated results for an experienced user. ReadMe-files or recording\nmethods for advanced characterization are stored in parallel with generated data.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nAlthough no metadata standard is available for the advanced characterization in this project,\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 4\nmost techniques store a non-standardized ReadMe-file containing recording parameters and file\ninformation in parallel with recorded datasets. Alternatively, some datasets contain metadata\nheaders on recording parameters (e.g. XRD diffractograms). The data will be stored and named\nin a consistent manner with unambiguous identifiers. Descriptions of experiments and materials\nare kept in physical lab notes for each identifier. The data will be processed and summarized in a\ncomprehensive excel worksheet with references to the identifiers. The resulting summaries will\nculminate in presentations, and finally in manuscripts and/or patents.\n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nPhysical hand-notes of procedures and initial observations are kept in lab books. Digital data,\nwith unambiguous identifiers for reactions and materials, are kept in cloud storage from ‘Box’.\nKU Leuven offers an Enterprise Box account 3, which offers an easy and  secure storage space of\nup to 100 GB for each user.\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nBy using the cloud storage of ‘Box’, digital data will be stored in parallel on the cloud and on the\npersonal computer of the applicant, guaranteeing back-up for this data. Most raw data is also\nstored and frequently backed up off-line on external hard drives.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThe cloud storage provides a storage space up to 100 GB for each user, while the project is\nexpected to generate less than 10 GB.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nData storage costs on Box are included in an internal service contract with the KU Leuven IT\nsupport service (SET-IT). No additional costs are expected for the storage of data. In case\nadditional costs do arise, they will be covered by the project budget or reserve funds.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nThe data will be stored in the university's secure environment for private data. An Enterprise Box\naccount 3 for cloud storage ensures a secure environment.\n6. Data preservation after the FWO project\nWhich data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the\nproject? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the\nreasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project.\nWhere will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)?\nUpon termination of the contract, the data will be transferred and stored on an external hard\ndrive (Samsung Portable SSD T5 1 TB), managed by Annelies Van Vlasselaer.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5\nyears? How will the costs be covered?\nThe high capacity of the available external hard drive (1 TB) enables the preservation of data\nfrom multiple terminated or finished projects. Currently, an average of 15 GB is used for the\nfinished projects of each user, which allows to divide its cost over approximately 60 users. Given\nthe cost of the available hard drive of 120 EUR, the expected costs are negligible. The involved\nIT-expenses are included in the project’s consumable expenses or covered by reserve funds.\n7. Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g.\nas defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)?\nNo\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 4\nWhich data will be made available after the end of the project?\nUpon publication of the research results, the full datasets will be made available upon reasonable\nrequest.\nWhere/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nUpon request by mail\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nWho will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nOnly uses for research purposes will be allowed and commercial reuse will be excluded.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will the costs be covered?\nNo additional costs are expected as the data can be shared via online platforms (e.g.\nWeTransfer) or the already budgeted storage cloud from Box.
