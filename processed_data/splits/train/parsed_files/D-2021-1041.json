The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\n1.General Information\nName applicant Jannick Vercammen\nFWO Project Number & Title 1263522N - Dehydrogenative, electrochemical coupling reactions of aromatics with transition metal \ncontaining zeolites as catalysts.\nAffiliation ☒ KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent\n☐ Universiteit Hasselt  \n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel\n☐ Other: \n2.Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make  \nuse of existing data?  ☒ Generate new data\n☐ Reuse existing data\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 2Describe the origin, type and format of the data \n(per dataset) and its (estimated) volume\nIf you reuse existing data, specify the source of \nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) \nfrom data formats (the technical format).Procedures for performing reactions, for synthesizing catalysts and initial observations of these \nexperiments will be gathered. The results of such reactions will result in raw data files containing \nchromatographic data (GC-FID, GC-MS, NMR) and materials characterization data (XRD, physi- and \nchemisorption data or spectroscopic analysis via NMR, EPR etc). These will be processed in excel files, \nsummaries and presentations, finally culminating in manuscripts and/or patents. The combined virtual \nvolume of these datasets will be limited (<10 GB), and will consist mostly of data files containing GC \nchromatograms (up to 5 GB).\n3.Ethical and legal issues\nWill you use personal data? If so, shortly describe  \nthe kind of personal data you will use AND add  \nthe  reference  to  your  file  in  your  host  \ninstitution's privacy register.\nIn case your host institution does not (yet) have a  \nprivacy register, a reference is not yet required of  \ncourse; please add the reference once the privacy  \nregister is in place in your host institution.☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes: \n-Privacy Registry Reference:\n-Short description of the kind of personal data that will be used:\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the \ncreation and/or use of the data (e.g. \nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If  \nso, add the reference to the formal approval by \nthe relevant ethical review committee(s).☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes: \n-Reference to ethical committee approval:\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 3Does your work possibly result in research data  \nwith potential for tech transfer and valorisation?  \nWill IP restrictions be claimed for the data you  \ncreated?  If  so,  for  what  data  and  which  \nrestrictions will be asserted?☒ Yes\n☐ No\nIf yes, please comment: The methods and reactor configurations developed in this project have potential \nfor valorization, which will be subjected for discussion during the project. Patents will be submitted, \ntransferred and valorized with the assistance of the intellectual property unit of KU Leuven Research & \nDevelopment (LRD).\nDo  existing  3rd party  agreements  restrict  \ndissemination  or  exploitation  of  the  data  you  \n(re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and  \nwhat restrictions are in place?☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes, please comment:\n4.Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable \nunderstanding and reuse of the data \ncollected/generated in this project?  Details to reproduce reaction procedures are described in a personal lab booklet. Upon presentation or \npublication of data, procedures are described in sufficient detail to enable a reproduction of the generated  \nresults for an experienced user. ReadMe-files or recording methods for advanced characterization are \nstored in parallel with generated data.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be used.  If  \nnot, state in detail which metadata will be \ncreated to make the data easy/easier to find \nand reuse.☐ Yes\n☒ No\nPlease specify: Although no metadata standard is available for the advanced characterization in this \nproject, most techniques store a non-standardized ReadMe-file containing recording parameters and file \ninformation in parallel with recorded datasets. Alternatively, some datasets contain metadata headers on \nrecording parameters (e.g. XRD diffractograms). The data will be stored and named in a consistent manner  \nwith unambiguous identifiers. Descriptions of experiments and materials are kept in physical lab notes for \neach identifier. The data will be processed and summarized in a comprehensive excel worksheet with \nreferences to the identifiers. The resulting summaries will culminate in presentations, and finally in \nmanuscripts and/or patents.\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 45.Data storage & backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?  Physical hand-notes of procedures and initial observations are kept in lab books. Digital data, with \nunambiguous identifiers for reactions and materials, are kept in cloud storage from ‘Box’. KU Leuven offers  \nan Enterprise Box account 3, which offers an easy and  secure storage space of up to 100 GB for each user.  \nHow will the data be backed up?  By using the cloud storage of ‘Box’, digital data will be stored in parallel on the cloud and on the personal \ncomputer of the applicant, guaranteeing back-up for this data. Most raw data is also stored and frequently  \nbacked up off-line on external hard drives.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.  ☒ Yes: The cloud storage provides a storage space up to 100 Gb for each user, while the project is \nexpected to generate less than 10 GB.\n☐ No\nIf no, please specify:  \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the project? How will these \ncosts be covered? \nAlthough FWO has no earmarked budget at its \ndisposal to support correct research data \nmanagement, FWO allows for part of the \nallocated project budget  to be used to cover the  \ncost incurred.Data storage costs on Box are included in an internal service contract with the KU Leuven IT support \nservice (SET-IT). No additional costs are expected for the storage of data. In case additional costs do arise, \nthey will be covered by the project budget or reserve funds.\nData security: how will you ensure that the data \nare securely stored and not accessed or \nmodified by unauthorized persons?  The data will be stored in the university's secure environment for private data. An Enterprise Box account \n3 for cloud storage ensures a secure environment.\n6.Data preservation after the end of the FWO project\nFWO expects that data generated during the project are retained for a period of minimally 5 years after the end of the project, in as far as legal and  \ncontractual agreements allow.\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 5Which data will be retained for the expected 5 \nyear period after the end of the project? In case \nonly a selection of the data can/will be \npreserved, clearly state the reasons  for this \n(legal or contractual restrictions, physical \npreservation issues, ...).All data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project.  \nWhere will these data be archived (= stored for \nthe long term)? Upon termination of the contract, the data will be transferred and stored on an external hard drive  \n(Samsung Portable SSD T5 1 TB), managed by Annelies Van Vlasselaer.\nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during these 5 years? How will the \ncosts be covered? \nAlthough FWO has no earmarked budget at its \ndisposal to support correct research data \nmanagement, FWO allows for part of the \nallocated project budget  to be used to cover the  \ncost incurred.The high capacity of the available external hard drive (1 TB) enables the preservation of data from multiple  \nterminated or finished projects. Currently, an average of 15 GB is used for the finished projects of each \nuser, which allows to divide its cost over approximately 60 users. Given the cost of the available hard drive  \nof 120 EUR, the expected costs are negligible. The involved IT-expenses are included in the project’s \nconsumable expenses or covered by reserve funds.\n7.Data sharing and reuse\nAre there any factors restricting or preventing \nthe sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as \ndefined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal \nrestrictions)? ☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes, please specify:\nWhich data will be made available after the end \nof the project? Upon publication of the research results, the full datasets will be made available upon reasonable request.\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 6Where/how will the data be made available for \nreuse? ☐ In an Open Access repository\n☐ In a restricted access repository\n☒ Upon request by mail\n☐ Other (specify):\nWhen will the data be made available?  Upon publication of the research results\nWho will be able to access the data and under \nwhat conditions? Only uses for research purposes will be allowed and commercial reuse will be excluded.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? \nHow will these costs be covered?  \nAlthough FWO has no earmarked budget at its \ndisposal to support correct research data \nmanagement, FWO allows for part of the \nallocated project budget  to be used to cover the  \ncost incurred.No additional costs are expected as the data can be shared via online platforms (e.g. WeTransfer) or the  \nalready budgeted storage cloud from Box. If additional costs would occur they will be covered from reserve  \nfunds.\n8.Responsibilities\nWho will be responsible for the data \ndocumentation & metadata?  The applicant (Jannick Vercammen).\nWho will be responsible for data storage & back \nup during the project?  The applicant (Jannick Vercammen), his supervisor (Dirk De Vos) and Annelies Van Vlasselaer.\nWho will be responsible for ensuring data \npreservation and sharing?  The supervisor (Dirk De Vos) and Annelies Van Vlasselaer.\n2019-10-01 | FWO DMP Template 7Who bears the end responsibility for updating &  \nimplementing this DMP?  \nDefault response: The PI bears the overall \nresponsibility for updating & implementing this \nDMPThe applicant and his supervisor bear the end responsibility of updating & implementing this DMP."
