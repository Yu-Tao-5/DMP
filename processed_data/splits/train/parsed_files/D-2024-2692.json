Threat controllability is\nthe actual or perceived ability to control an aversive event. Uncontrollable events are often experienced as more stressful and challenging than\ncontrollable events. Specifically, research has shown that uncontrollable experiences result in adverse outcomes (e.g., enhanced cortisol levels) and\nincrease susceptibility to negative consequences of future aversive situations. Conversely, behavioural control over stressful events seems to protect\nagainst these effects. Exactly how threat (un)controllability impacts stress reactivity remains unclear, however, in part due to the unidirectional nature\nof research to date. The current project will explore the association between threat (un)controllability and stress reactivity from a bidirectional\nperspective. Furthermore, we will assess potential moderators (such as gender) and mechanisms (such as emotion regulation) contributing to their\nrelationship. Finally, we aim to investigate whether exploiting threat controllability in a clinical context can boost the effect of interventions for anxiety\ndisorders. Investigating threat (un)controllability and stress reactivity will thus help clarifying their role in the development and maintenance of\npsychiatric disorders.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n29-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

After the data collection is completed, the digital data will be\ntransferred to SharePoint provided by KU Leuven. SharePoint provides safe storage of the data that can be accessed even when the individual\nresearcher leaves the institution. The paper data will be stored in a key-locked cabinet in the office of the main researcher (Michalina Dudziak),\nseparate from the other data files. The paper data will be retained for 10 years (KU Leuven RDM-richtlijn), after which they will be destroyed\nusing dedicated university procedures for the destructing of sensitive documents (in the case of paper documents) or by the erasure of\nelectronic files from the backup drive. \nThe biological human samples (e.g., saliva samples) will be stored in a low-temperature freezer (-18 to -21°C) at the Faculty of Psychology\nand Educational Sciences before shipping them to the laboratory (Dresden LabService GmbH) for processing.

As described in the application to the ethics committee (S68015) and PRET application (G-2023-6831): Experimental data will be collected, stored, and processed electronically in a format that does not allow connecting the experimental data to individuals. Specifically, all participants will be assigned a unique individual numeric code (e.g., P01). Experimental data will be stored and processed using those unique codes and will never be linked to participants' names. Participants will enroll themselves in the experiment via the EMS system with their EMS code. EMS-code and the participant’s identity cannot be linked. The EMS code will not not be used as a unique numeric code. Participants will be asked for their informed consent prior to each study. Participants will be asked for their informed consent to collect and share the non-identifiable data on the Open Science Framework (quote from the approved informed consent form by the Ethics Committee Research UZ/KU Leuven \" In the context of transparency in scientific research, the data of this research can be shared with others, for example with researchers from other universities or on the Open Science Framework (www.osf.io). In this case, only nonidentifiable data will be shared. \") Participants will indicate their names on the paper format data (informed consent form and adverse events form), which will be stored in a key-locked cabinet in the office of the main researcher (Michalina Dudziak), separate from the other data files. The paper data will not not contain the unique individual numeric code. The payment information (EMS codes, bank account numbers) will be collected only for reimbursement purposes.

Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? During the data collection, digital data files will be stored on a secure personal OneDrive linked to a KU Leuven account of the main researcher (Michalina Dudziak), which only project members can access. After the data collection is completed, the digital data will be transferred to SharePoint provided by KU Leuven. SharePoint provides safe storage of the data that can be accessed even when the individual researcher leaves the institution. The paper data will be stored in a key-locked cabinet in the office of the main researcher (Michalina Dudziak), separate from the other data files. The paper data will be retained for 10 years (KU Leuven RDM-richtlijn), after which they will be destroyed using dedicated university procedures for the destructing of sensitive documents (in the case of paper documents) or by the erasure of electronic files from the backup drive. The biological human samples (e.g., saliva samples) will be stored in a low-temperature freezer (-18 to -21°C) at the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences before shipping them to the laboratory (Dresden LabService GmbH) for processing. The details of processing, storage, and destination of saliva samples have been included in the Biobank application and approved by the Biobank manager Kristel Van Landuyt. The saliva samples will be destroyed by the Dresden Lab 2 weeks after the assay. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? 1 .

How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Multi-factor authentication is activated for the KU Leuven login of all researchers having access to the data. Pseudonymized digital data will be stored in a folder on the main researcher's OneDrive which can only be accessed by an authorized link. Access to the data will be given to the supervisor, main data manager, and student researchers collecting data in the current project. Students will lose access to the data as soon as the project is completed and the data is analyzed. Highly confidential digital data (e.g., payment information collected for reimbursement purposes) will be additionally password-protected and will be stored on the personal OneDrive of the main researcher. Access to the data will be given to the KU Leuven Finance Department which will complete payments for each participant. After the completion of each study, digital data will be transferred to secured SharePoint. Access to data on SharePoint will only be given to the supervisor, the main data manager, and the main researcher (Michalina Dudziak). Analogue data (e.g., informed consent forms, and adverse event forms) will be stored in a locked cupboard of the main researcher's office.
