As dogs at work are likely to impact firm\nfunctions, employee wellbeing, interpersonal processes and organizational performance, such\nknowledge is essential to properly develop guidelines and protocols. Scholars have urged for\nsuch protocols, yet, to our knowledge, we are the first who aim to develop clear protocols for\noptimizing telework and office-dog policies, hereby identifying the circumstances under which\nsuch policies truly benefit employees and organizations. To tackle the gaps mentioned above, we\nfocus on two objectives. First, we aim for testing the effects of dogs at the home workplace on\nteleworking employees (OBJECTIVE 1). Specifically, we aim to study whether having a dog at\nhome while teleworking can counter drawbacks of telework by increasing physical exercise and\nwork detachment, hereby decreasing stress and increasing job performance. \nWe aim to do this\nby studying employeesâ€™ wellbeing and performance indicators on a within-subject level to\nassess mechanisms (Objective 1.1) and on a between-subject level to assess moderators also in\nlarger sample sizes (Objective 1.2). Knowledge on these effects can help organizations to\neffectively target telework policies to dog owning employees, addressing potential risks and\nallowing the benefits of dogs at the home workplace to reach their full potential. Second, we aim\nfor testing the effects of dogs at the office on dog bringing employees and their co-workers\n(OBJECTIVE 2). With this knowledge, we aim to optimize protocols for firms that wish to\nimplement office-dog policies, addressing not just benefits but also important risks. This\nknowledge could help organizations developing adequate dog-related policies. To address our\nobjectives, we conduct three studies. STUDY 1: For Objective 1.1, i.e. to examine the daily effects\nof dogs at teleworking days, we have conducted a daily diary, longitudinal study in the spring of\n2021 and the autumn of 2021. Data: online repeated survey data from 417 respondents (3353\ndata points) in spring and in 164 respondents (1376 data points), of whom 90 participated in\nspring. Of the respondents participating in spring, 35 respondents wore a Garmin smartwatch\nwhich we also include in our data. From 12 of those respondents, we also collected smartcollar\ndata from their dog. These studies were approved by the ethical committee and the GDPR\ncommittee: spring data collection under G-2020-2445-R4(MAR) and autumn data collection under\nG-2020-2445-R5(AMD). Research questions and research purpose are clarified and detail and\nwere approved before the onset of data collection. STUDY 2: For Objective 1.2, i.e. to examine\nthe moderators of effects of dogs at the home office, we will conduct a cross-lagged longitudinal\nstudy with 700 employees: 400 dog owning teleworkers, 100 dog owning non-teleworkers en 200\nnon-dog owning teleworkers. Participants will be asked to fill out surveys on three occasions each\nsix months apart. STUDY 3: For Objective 2, i.e. to examine the daily effects of dogs at the office,\nwe will conduct a daily diary study with 120 employees: 40 employees who bring their dog to\nwork, 40 co-workers who do not bring their dog to work and 40 co-workers who do not own a dog\n(i.e. three groups) during 10 consecutive working days. Similar to Study 1, participants will fill out\na background survey at the start of the study and daily surveys during 10 consecutive working\ndays once at the end of the workday and once at the end of the evening. Also similar to Study 1,\nparticipants will be asked to wear a Garmin smartwatch or an Apple smartwatch and let their dog\nwear a PetPace smartcollar or a SensDog collar.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

Data description\nWill you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\nReuse existing data\nDescribe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its\n(estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and\nper WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of\nthese data. \nDistinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the\ntechnical format).\nThe project consists of three studies described in three work packages. For each study/work\npackage, we will:\n(1) make use of existing data, more specifically of published research, existing\nresearch models and theories (e.g., attachment theory, social support theory, self-regulation\ntheory)\n(2) collect (or have collected), analyze and document survey data and smart wearable data. The\nsurvey\n datasets will be\nsaved as a datafile, both in CSV (Excell), SPSS and R. In addition, we will save the syntax\n(.spsfile), the R-code (.R) and document the metadata (as word-files; see further for more\ninformation about the metadata). The \nsmart wearable\n datasets will be saved as a datafile in\nCSV (Excell) and R. In addition, we will save the R-code (.R) and document the metadata as\nwordfiles. Furthermore, raw smart wearable data from the Garmin smartwatches are additionally\nsaved as .fit files as well as are stored within the pseudonimised accounts created on Garmin\nConnect to easily access and visualize the data.

If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s)\nYes\n The studies considering WP1 were approved by the ethical committee and the GDPR committee:\nspring data collection under G-2020-2445-R4(MAR) and autumn data collection under G-2020-\n2445-R5(AMD). Research questions and research purpose are clarified and detail and were\napproved before the onset of data collection. \n \nFor the studies considering WP2 and WP3, we will submit these studies to the following ethical\ncommittees:\nSocial and Societal Committee (SMEC), KU Leuven\nGDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), KU Leuven\nWe will also contact KU Leuven's responsible person of the Animal Experimentation Committee to\nget a formal decision that our research does not involve animal experiments. As we only engage\nowned animals, our studies do not fall under the Belgian law for animal experimentation. As the\nKU Leuven together with other universities is discussing these types of studies, we will be in\ntouch with potential evolutions on this matter and will contact the aniaml experimentation board\naccordingly if necessary.\nDoes your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and\nvalorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what\ndata and which restrictions will be asserted?\nNo\nNot applicable\nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data\nyou (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?\nNo\nNot applicable\n4. Documentation and metadata\nWhat documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated\nin this project?\nFor every work package, we will generate metadata files (in word) which contain the following\ninformation:\n1. General description of the research (e.g., researchers involved, title of the project, keywords\nbased on Thesaurus EBSCOhost, etc.)\n2. Description of the study design, sampling decisions, etc.\n3. A codebook about the survey and the main dataset (e.g., variable names and labels, origin of\nthe scales that are used, link between the variables and the survey questions, etc.).\n4. The informed consent form\n5. Information about the analyses (e.g., syntax), research methods and research results.\n6. If we keep different versions of the dataset, we will document the differences between these\nversions. Different versions will get a name that suggests the link between the different versions\n(e.g., date in the filename, subsequent numbering: 1.1, 1.2).\n7. The research questions/papers for which the data are used\nAll metadata will be stored at the research unit's storage facility (i.e., X-drive; which is secured\nand can only be accessed by the researchers of the research group; and KU Leuven OneDrive;\nwhich is only accessible by the main researcher and people who are granted access by this\nresearcher).\nIn addition, some metadata (i.e., (1) the general description of the research, (2) description of\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n6 of 10\nthe study design and (7) the research questions/papers for which the data are used) will be made\navailable publically (e.g., via Open Science Framework). Other metadata can be shared upon\nrequest.\nWill a metadata standard be used? If so, \ndescribe in detail which standard will be\nused. \nIf no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nNo\nMetadata of the research (e.g., general description, codebook, questionaires, research methods,\netc.) will be created manually. \n5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nThe main researcher (Joni Delanoeije) will be responsible for all data storage. Data will be stored\non the internal storing system of KU Leuven (i.e., KU Leuven OneDrive). The personal data will\nonly be accessible in separate documents so they cannot be linked with each other. Only the\nmain researcher will keep a document to link both documents on the secured data storage\nsystem of KU Leuven in her personal OneDrive, which is set with a password. \nConcerning the files with file with the emailaddresses; these files will be deleted when all data\narecollected and the data of the different waves are linked (and some prizes are raffled).\nConcerning the original datasets and all metadata; these will be kept on our research unit central\nstorage facility of the FEB, KULeuven (i.e., X-drive, which can only be accessed by researchers of\nthe research group and which is secured) and on the KU Leuven OneDrive of the main\nresearcher. Copies can be made and kept on this research unit central storage facility.\nConcerning the metadata; some of these will also be made publically available, for instance via\nopen science framework (see other questions).\nHow is backup of the data provided?\nThe files with the emailaddresses will be stored on the pmain researcher's personal central\nstorage facility of the FEB KULeuven (i.e., KU Leuven OneDrive) which is secured, can only be\naccessed by the main researcher and has automatic daily back-up procedures.

If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nSince the size of the datafiles is limited, we foresee no problem.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nWe do not foresee any additional costs for data storage or backup. In case we would need\nadditional back up space (e.g., in case we would generate big data using smart wearables in a\ndifferent research design), we will cover these costs with various available budgets of the main\nresearcher and the supervisor of the project. Data storage platforms that will be used will only\ninclude those offered by the university (i.e., KU Leuven OneDrive and/or X/Y drives). \nData security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed\nor modified by unauthorized persons?\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n7 of 10\nThe files with the emailaddresses will be stored on the pmain researcher's personal central\nstorage facility of the FEB KULeuven (i.e., KU Leuven OneDrive) which is secured, can only be\naccessed by the main researcher and has automatic daily back-up procedures.

With this knowledge, we aim to optimize protocols for firms that wish to implement office-dog policies, addressing not just benefits but also important risks. This knowledge could help organizations developing adequate dog-related policies. To address our objectives, we conduct three studies. STUDY 1: For Objective 1.1, i.e. to examine the daily effects of dogs at teleworking days, we have conducted a daily diary, longitudinal study in the spring of 2021 and the autumn of 2021. Data: online repeated survey data from 417 respondents (3353 data points) in spring and in 164 respondents (1376 data points), of whom 90 participated in spring. Of the respondents participating in spring, 35 respondents wore a Garmin smartwatch which we also include in our data. From 12 of those respondents, we also collected smartcollar data from their dog. These studies were approved by the ethical committee and the GDPR committee: spring data collection under G-2020-2445-R4(MAR) and autumn data collection under G-2020-2445-R5(AMD). Research questions and research purpose are clarified and detail and were approved before the onset of data collection. STUDY 2: For Objective 1.2, i.e. to examine the moderators of effects of dogs at the home office, we will conduct a cross-lagged longitudinal study with 700 employees: 400 dog owning teleworkers, 100 dog owning non-teleworkers en 200 non-dog owning teleworkers. Participants will be asked to fill out surveys on three occasions each six months apart. STUDY 3: For Objective 2, i.e. to examine the daily effects of dogs at the office, we will conduct a daily diary study with 120 employees: 40 employees who bring their dog to work, 40 co-workers who do not bring their dog to work and 40 co-workers who do not own a dog (i.e. three groups) during 10 consecutive working days. Similar to Study 1, participants will fill out a background survey at the start of the study and daily surveys during 10 consecutive working days once at the end of the workday and once at the end of the evening. Also similar to Study 1, participants will be asked to wear a Garmin smartwatch or an Apple smartwatch and let their dog wear a PetPace smartcollar or a SensDog collar. Institution KU Leuven 1. General Information Name applicant Fellow: Joni Delanoeije (KU Leuven) Main supervisor: Marijke Verbruggen (KU Leuven) FWO Project Number & Title 12B0522N: ‘My work feels like home’: Effects of dogs in the 2020 (home) workplace on employee wellbeing and performance Affiliation This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 1 of 10 Affiliation KU Leuven Universiteit Gent Co-supervisors: Geert van Hootegem (KU Leuven) & Christel Moons (UGent) 2. Data description Will you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data? Generate new data Reuse existing data Describe in detail the origin, type and format of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a table (see example) or as a data flow and per WP or objective of the project. If you reuse existing data, specify the source of these data. Distinguish data types (the kind of content) from data formats (the technical format). The project consists of three studies described in three work packages. For each study/work package, we will: (1) make use of existing data, more specifically of published research, existing research models and theories (e.g., attachment theory, social support theory, self-regulation theory) (2) collect (or have collected), analyze and document survey data and smart wearable data. The survey datasets will be saved as a datafile, both in CSV (Excell), SPSS and R. In addition, we will save the syntax (.spsfile), the R-code (.R) and document the metadata (as word-files; see further for more information about the metadata). The smart wearable datasets will be saved as a datafile in CSV (Excell) and R. In addition, we will save the R-code (.R) and document the metadata as wordfiles. Furthermore, raw smart wearable data from the Garmin smartwatches are additionally saved as .fit files as well as are stored within the pseudonimised accounts created on Garmin Connect to easily access and visualize the data. These pseudonimised accounts are created and managed by the main researcher (i.e., the project applicant). Study How created?

Legal and ethical issues Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add the reference to your file in KU Leuven's Register of Data Processing for Research and Public Service Purposes (PRET application). Be aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation. Yes Privacy Registry Reference: The studies considering WP1 were approved by the ethical committee and the GDPR committee: spring data collection under G-2020-2445-R4(MAR) and autumn data collection under G-2020-2445-R5(AMD). Research questions and research purpose are clarified and detail and were approved before the onset of data collection. Short description of the kind of personal data that will be used: survey data, smart wearable data This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 5 of 10 (from people and from dogs), e-mailaddresses to be able to collect data longitudinally Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant ethical review committee(s) Yes The studies considering WP1 were approved by the ethical committee and the GDPR committee: spring data collection under G-2020-2445-R4(MAR) and autumn data collection under G-2020- 2445-R5(AMD). Research questions and research purpose are clarified and detail and were approved before the onset of data collection. For the studies considering WP2 and WP3, we will submit these studies to the following ethical committees: Social and Societal Committee (SMEC), KU Leuven GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), KU Leuven We will also contact KU Leuven's responsible person of the Animal Experimentation Committee to get a formal decision that our research does not involve animal experiments. As we only engage owned animals, our studies do not fall under the Belgian law for animal experimentation. As the KU Leuven together with other universities is discussing these types of studies, we will be in touch with potential evolutions on this matter and will contact the aniaml experimentation board accordingly if necessary. Does your work possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted? No Not applicable Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place? No Not applicable 4. Documentation and metadata What documentation will be provided to enable reuse of the data collected/generated in this project? For every work package, we will generate metadata files (in word) which contain the following information: 1. General description of the research (e.g., researchers involved, title of the project, keywords based on Thesaurus EBSCOhost, etc.) 2. Description of the study design, sampling decisions, etc. 3. A codebook about the survey and the main dataset (e.g., variable names and labels, origin of the scales that are used, link between the variables and the survey questions, etc.). 4. The informed consent form 5. Information about the analyses (e.g., syntax), research methods and research results. 6. If we keep different versions of the dataset, we will document the differences between these versions. Different versions will get a name that suggests the link between the different versions (e.g., date in the filename, subsequent numbering: 1.1, 1.2). 7. The research questions/papers for which the data are used All metadata will be stored at the research unit's storage facility (i.e., X-drive; which is secured and can only be accessed by the researchers of the research group; and KU Leuven OneDrive; which is only accessible by the main researcher and people who are granted access by this researcher). In addition, some metadata (i.e., (1) the general description of the research, (2) description of This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 6 of 10 the study design and (7) the research questions/papers for which the data are used) will be made available publically (e.g., via Open Science Framework). Other metadata can be shared upon request. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used. If no, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse. No Metadata of the research (e.g., general description, codebook, questionaires, research methods, etc.) will be created manually. 5. Data storage and backup during the FWO project Where will the data be stored? The main researcher (Joni Delanoeije) will be responsible for all data storage. Data will be stored on the internal storing system of KU Leuven (i.e., KU Leuven OneDrive). The personal data will only be accessible in separate documents so they cannot be linked with each other. Only the main researcher will keep a document to link both documents on the secured data storage system of KU Leuven in her personal OneDrive, which is set with a password. Concerning the files with file with the emailaddresses; these files will be deleted when all data arecollected and the data of the different waves are linked (and some prizes are raffled). Concerning the original datasets and all metadata; these will be kept on our research unit central storage facility of the FEB, KULeuven (i.e., X-drive, which can only be accessed by researchers of the research group and which is secured) and on the KU Leuven OneDrive of the main researcher. Copies can be made and kept on this research unit central storage facility. Concerning the metadata; some of these will also be made publically available, for instance via open science framework (see other questions). How is backup of the data provided? The files with the emailaddresses will be stored on the pmain researcher's personal central storage facility of the FEB KULeuven (i.e., KU Leuven OneDrive) which is secured, can only be accessed by the main researcher and has automatic daily back-up procedures. These files will be deleted once all data for that work package is collected and data of the different waves are linked (and some prizes are raffled). The (pseudonymized) datasets and all meta-data will additionally be stored on our research unit central storage facility of the FEB KULeuven (i.e., X-drive) which is secured and has automatical daily back-up procedures. Some metadata (i.e., (1) general description of the research (2) description of the research design and method) and (7) research questions/papers for which the data is used) will be made publically available, probably via the open science framework; as well as through a website dedicated to the project and/or the affiliated researchers. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Since the size of the datafiles is limited, we foresee no problem. What are the expected costs for data storage and back up during the project? How will these costs be covered? We do not foresee any additional costs for data storage or backup. In case we would need additional back up space (e.g., in case we would generate big data using smart wearables in a different research design), we will cover these costs with various available budgets of the main researcher and the supervisor of the project. Data storage platforms that will be used will only include those offered by the university (i.e., KU Leuven OneDrive and/or X/Y drives). Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?

Data preservation after the FWO project Which data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project? In case only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...). The files with the emailaddresses will be deleted once all data for that work package is collected and data of the different waves are linked (and some prizes are raffled).This was or will be communicated like this to the respondents in the informed consent form. The (pseudonymized) datasets and all metadata will be stored on our research unit central storage facility of the FEB, KULeuven (i.e., X-drive) which is secured and can only be accessed by the researchers of the research group. Some metadata (i.e., (1) general description of the research (2) description of the research design and method) and (7) research questions/papers for which the data is used) will be made publically available, probably via the open science framework. All these data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project. Where will the data be archived (= stored for the longer term)? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the retention period of 5 years? How will the costs be covered? The files with the emailaddresses will be deleted once all data for that work package is collected and data of the different waves are linked (and some prizes are raffled).This was or will be communicated like this to the respondents in the informed consent form.

All these data will be retained for the expected 5 year period after the end of the project. 7. Data sharing and reuse Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? No Not applicable Which data will be made available after the end of the project? If there is an interesting research opportunity with external researchers - and if this is in line with our informed consent form - we might consider sharing the datasets with external researchers. In that case, we will make specific arrangements with these external researchers, among others about ethical use of the data and guaranteeing secure storage (e.g., via a license, like https://creativecommons.org/share-yourwork/). This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 8 of 10 Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? Upon request by mail Some metadata (i.e., (1) general description of the research (2) description of the research design and method) and (7) research questions/papers for which the data is used) will be made publically available, probably via the open science framework. In the case that external researchers are interested in research questions which can be answered with one of our datasets, they can contact the researchers of the project and other metadata can be shared.
