For all published material, full bibliographic references will be kept. When possible, findability will be ensured through the use of unique identifiers such as DOI. Offline copies of online publications for which the longterm availability cannot be guaranteed will be kept in the KU Leuven Drive as pdf. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3.

Last modiﬁed 22 April 2024 5 of 8 How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Two-factor authentication provides a sufficient level of protection for non-personal data as well as for the pseudonymized transcribed interviews. The pseudonymisation map will be isolated from the dataset. It will be stored on the KU Leuven OneDrive in a separate folder encrypted with AES Crypt. This is considered a sufficient protective measure for storage on a server of a non-European company such as OneDrive. The audio recordings of the interviews will be deleted after being transcribed, pursuant to the principle of data minimisation. In the meantime, they will be stored in a separate folder on the KU Leuven OneDrive which will be encrypted with AES Crypt. The transcription should take place within 48 hours from the interview. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? OneDrive and KU Leuven Drives: no additional costs. Zotero cloud storage: free (in case extra-storage capacity was needed, the costs of 20$ per year for the premium version could be covered by the FWO-grant) 4.

At the end of the project all data will be transferred to a network-drive of the project supervisor, prof. Wouter Devroe.
