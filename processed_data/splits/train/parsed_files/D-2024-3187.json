Despite\nnumerous policies aimed at improving ARH, Uganda continues to experience high rates of adolescent pregnancies and unsafe abortions.\nThis study focuses on Uganda and more specifically on South-Western Uganda. It employs a multi-method approach to achieve the\nfollowing objectives: \nTo assess the potential impact of the current reproductive health policies targeted at addressing adolescent pregnancies in East\nAfrica\nTo determine the trends in prevalence and associated factors of adolescent pregnancies in Uganda using 15 years of Uganda\nDemographic Health Survey (UDHS)\nTo study the barriers, facilitators, and coping mechanisms for the development and implementation of selected ARH policies in\nUganda, this will be done through interviews with policymakers, and healthcare providers and observation at health facilities and\ncommunities\nTo co-create feasible recommendations to improve ARH policies content and implementation. This shall be done through\nparticipatory action research with adolescents and dialogue meetings with stakeholders. \nThe findings will contribute to evidence-based policy development and implementation. Ultimately aiming to improve the reproductive\nhealth of adolescents in Uganda.\nThis PhD is funded by BOF through the Scholarship from the South program, under grant number ZB/24/033.\nID: \nID: \n210403\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-10-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n30-09-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n11-01-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
