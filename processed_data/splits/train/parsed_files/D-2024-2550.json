Conformational changes are a key regulatory mechanisms in proteins, but it is currently very difficult to generate\nprotein domains that show pronounced conformational changes in response to a stimulus of choice. \nThis project aims to overcome this limitation by creating conditional enzymes called 'NanoBlocks', in which highly generic affinity binders are\ncombined with split enzymes in such a way that binding of the target results in a conformational change and activation of the split enzyme. In\nparticular, I propose to develop a framework that will allow conditional enzymes to be created against, in theory, any target for which a nanobody is\navailable. To achieve this, I will set up a screening system based on yeast surface display and fluorescence-assisted cell sorting that can simultaneously\nmonitor binding and the molecular response. The resulting methodology will be used to develop two such enzymes, a tool for conditional interactome\nmapping, as well as a tool to engineer new signaling pathways via conditional protease activity.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n26-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
