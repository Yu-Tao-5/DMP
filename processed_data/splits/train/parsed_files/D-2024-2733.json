The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the \nfinal evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP \nmay use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish \nStandard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders  \nand research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data \nmanagement planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is \navailable via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Adriaan Demuynck – Orcid ID: 0000-0002-3678-9328\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Raf Van Rooy (0000-0003-3739-8465) – promotor\nReinhart Ceulemans (0000-0003-0552-7074) – copromotor\nHan Lamers (0000-0001-7965-8339) - copromotor\nProject number 1 & title  11PU124N - The early modern city as literary domain: A systematic study of the city encomium and its \ntransformations (ca. 1403–1585), with special reference to multilingual representations of urban spaces.\nFunder(s) GrantID 2\nAffiliation(s) ☒ KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nROR identifier KU Leuven:  05f950310\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

These ‘city encomia’ have attracted some attention in \nthe last decades, but only  on a case study basis, without considering its broader transformations. This \nproject will perform a  large-scale, data-driven analysis of the forms and contents of the genre. Firstly, I will  \nbuild a database of city encomia in print and manuscript from western and central Europe of the period \n1403-1585. In the database, I will record metadata regarding authorship and characteristics of form and \ncontent. Secondly, using these new data, I will study the spread of the genre and its \ntransformations, visualizing it on maps; compose a detailed typology of the genre; and determine the \nrelation to the earlier traditions of city encomia: classical, western medieval, and the overlooked Byzantine  \ntradition. Thirdly, the project will perform a case study on the network of English diplomat Daniel Rogers. I  \nwill prepare digital critical editions and study how urban spaces are represented in these texts in relation \nto different parameters like language choice, author motivation, and topoi used. This  will finally lead to the  \nencompassing analysis of  the early modern city encomium, thus contributing  to early modern literary \nstudies, Neo- Latin and New Ancient Greek studies, classical and Byzantine  reception studies, spatial and \ndigital humanities.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): A digital copy of the dissertation will be stored and made accessible in Lirias, the database of publications by KU Leuven researchers. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?The data will be preserved by storing it on KU Leuven RDR. Every user can publish up to 50GB per year. I do not expect the data to exceed this limit. If not, costs for extra storage will be covered by the bench fee of the researcher. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY.

If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED.

If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☒ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☐ No What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? The data will be made available for reuse by publishing it on KU Leuven RDR. Every user can publish up to 50GB per year. I do not expect the data to exceed this limit. If not, costs for extra storage will be covered by the bench fee of the researcher. 7.
