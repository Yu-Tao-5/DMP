With an average\nyield loss of 23%, plant diseases and pests are an important threat to global food security. Chemical plant protection products (PPPs) are widely used to control\ndiseases and pests. Due to their environmental impact and the resistance development of pathogens and pests against several PPPs, their application becomes more\nand more restricted. The European Farm to Fork strategy envisages to reduce the overall use and risk of chemical PPPs with 50% by 2030. To achieve this\nambitious goal, alternative and highly effective management strategies, based on innovative technologies are needed. The SynBioS consortium aims to develop an\ninnovative concept of synergy, where biocontrol technologies with different modes of action are being combined. To target insects, we will develop a root-\nassociated microbe based approach to enhance plant resistance, and an indirect approach based on phages, targeting bacterial symbionts of the insects. To target\nfungi and bacteria, SynBioS will explore the composition and functionalities of the phyllosphere microbiome and use this data to develop a synthetic microbial\ncommunity specifically tailored to tackle diseases. The different approaches will be combined and evaluated for potential synergies. Finally, to strongly increase the\nvalorization potential of the SynBioS results, we will analyze the social acceptability and economic feasibility of the innovative biocontrol strategies. The SynBioS\nproject will focus on strawberry as a first proof-of-concept and against its most important airborne diseases and pests. However, we expect that the groundbreaking\ntechnology-driven toolbox, developed by the SynBioS consortium, can be extrapolated to other crop production systems and will lead to a breakthrough in the\nefficacy and adoption rates of biological control. \nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n11-07-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

With an average yield loss of 23%, plant diseases and pests are an important threat to global food security. Chemical plant protection products (PPPs) are widely used to control diseases and pests. Due to their environmental impact and the resistance development of pathogens and pests against several PPPs, their application becomes more and more restricted. The European Farm to Fork strategy envisages to reduce the overall use and risk of chemical PPPs with 50% by 2030. To achieve this ambitious goal, alternative and highly effective management strategies, based on innovative technologies are needed. The SynBioS consortium aims to develop an innovative concept of synergy, where biocontrol technologies with different modes of action are being combined. To target insects, we will develop a root- associated microbe based approach to enhance plant resistance, and an indirect approach based on phages, targeting bacterial symbionts of the insects. To target fungi and bacteria, SynBioS will explore the composition and functionalities of the phyllosphere microbiome and use this data to develop a synthetic microbial community specifically tailored to tackle diseases. The different approaches will be combined and evaluated for potential synergies. Finally, to strongly increase the valorization potential of the SynBioS results, we will analyze the social acceptability and economic feasibility of the innovative biocontrol strategies. The SynBioS project will focus on strawberry as a first proof-of-concept and against its most important airborne diseases and pests. However, we expect that the groundbreaking technology-driven toolbox, developed by the SynBioS consortium, can be extrapolated to other crop production systems and will lead to a breakthrough in the efficacy and adoption rates of biological control.
