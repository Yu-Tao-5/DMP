It involves the design, fabrication and characterization of solid-state\nsystems, aiming to create and understanding non-trivial band topology and electron correlation\nphenomena in 2-dimensional and van der Waals materials. During the project, experimental and\nsimulation data will be collected and analyzed in order to answer the following research\nquestions: Which electron correlation phenomena and non-trivial band topology (e.g.\nferromagnetism and quantum anomalous Hall effect) emerge in these materials? Which\nphenomena (e.g. Majorana states) emerge from interfacing such materials? Can these systems\nbe driven through different quantum states in device architectures?\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1. General Information\nName of the project lead (PI)\nMichel Houssa (KU Leuven)\nInternal Funds Project number & title\nZKE0454 - C14/21/083, Electron correlations and non-trivial band topology in 2D materials\n2. Data description\n2.1. Will you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data?\nGenerate new data\n2.2. What data will you collect, generate or reuse? Describe the origin, type and\nformat of the data (per dataset) and its (estimated) volume. This may be easiest in a\nnumbered list or table and per objective of the project.\nPrimary data (generated by researcher and research group):\n \n1) Analogue data:\n1.1) Samples (bulk solids and films on a substrate).\n1.2) Laboratory logbooks.\n1.3) Researchersâ€™ notebooks.\n \n2) Digital data (total estimated volume of tens to hundreds of GB/year):\n2.1) Experimental data (as directly measured): ASCII data files containing numerical data\n(measurement output) and text metadata (describing experimental/instrumental parameters).\nDifferent formats (.txt, .dat and .cvs), depending on instrument used for the measurements.\n2.2) Processed and analyzed experimental data: text documents, spreadsheets and graphical\nrepresentation of data, used for (or resulting from) data analysis. \n2.3) Electronic laboratory logbooks.\n2.4) Computational simulation data, generated through scripts and codes. Intermediate raw data\nwill generally not be saved. Instead, the scripts from which the data was generated (and can be\nregenerated) will be saved. I particular, the following data types will be collected: original input\ndata (as scripts used by various comptational softwares); essential output data (atomic\nconfigurations, simulation outputs, etc.); list of computational settings in order to enable\nreproduction of the calculations.\n3. Ethical and legal issues\n3.1. Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you\nwill use. Add the reference to the file in KU Leuven's Record of Processing Activities.\nBe aware that registering the fact that you process personal data is a legal obligation.\nNo personal data will be used in this project.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 5\n3.2. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g.\nexperiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal\napproval by the relevant ethical review committee(s).\nNo ethical issues are encountered in this project.\n3.3. Does your research possibly result in research data with potential for tech\ntransfer and valorisation? Will IP restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If\nso, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted?\nAlthough tech transfer and valorisation are not direct goals of this project, if such an opportunity\npresents itself, it will be discussed among the staff and collaborators involved in the project. The\nconclusions of that discussion will be appended to this data management plan.\n3.4. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the\ndata you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions regarding\nreuse and sharing are in place?\nNo 3rd party restriction.\n4. Documentation and metadata\n4.1. What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of the\ndata collected/generated in this project?\nDuring each experiment, a detailed logbook will be used (different logbooks for the different\nexperimental setups). These logbooks will contain the date, a brief description of the performed\nexperiment, the parameters used for each measurement, as well as the names of all the saved\nfiles.\nThe names of the files will be structured in a comprehensible way:\nsystem studied/date/main parameters used\nIn addition, data will be stored in a folder per experimental setup, the type of investigated\nsystem and the corresponding date. In this way, by tracking the corresponding logbook notes,\neach file can be easily found on the local computers controlling the setup and on the server of\nthe laboratory.\nThe analysis files will contain notes describing the analysis procedure and mention which original\ndata files are included. A readme file describing the goal of the experiment and the analysis\nprocedure will be stored in the folder where the data is saved.\nFor the computational simulation data, descriptions of the scripts/codes will be provided. Where\nneeded, tutorials will be developed in order to present newly developed codes.\n4.2. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be\nused. If not, state in detail which metadata will be created to make the data\neasy/easier to find and reuse.\nRegarding the experimental data, in the relevant research field, there is no formal metadata\nstandard. However, the standardized steps described in this section 4 will ensure that the data is\neasy to find and reuse.\n \nRegarding the computational simulation data, most of the meta-data will be related to entries in\nthe Zenodo repository.\nThe following metadata will be stored for each entry in the Zenodo repository:\n \nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n2 of 5\nMetadata\nCategory\nAdditional comments\nType of data\nMandatory\n \nDOI\nMandatory\nIf not filled, Zenodo will assign an\nautomatic DOI.

Data storage and backup during the project\n5.1. Where will the data be stored?\nFor the experimental data, all physical logbooks will be stored in a cabinet next to the respective\nexperimental setups. Once the each logbook is full, it will be stored in a central storage cabinet\nof the institute, for a period of 15 years after the last registered experiment. The electronic data,\nincluding the logbook copies, raw data and analysis files, as well as reports, will be saved on local\ncomputers. The data stored on these computers is backed-up via the MS OneDrive Business\nservice and on local servers. All researchers involved in the project will have access to the\ncorresponding folder.\nFor the compuational simulation data, all the data (digital) will be stored on local computers and\nbacked up on local servers and via the MS OneDrive Business service.\n5.2. How will the data be backed up?\nThe data will be stored on local computers and servers with automatic back-up\nprocedures on local servers and via the MS OneDrive Business service.\n5.3. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes,\nspecify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then\nexplain how this will be taken care of.\nYes. The amount of data that will be generated in this project should not exceed a few hundred\nGBs, which is small enough to be stored in local computers, on local servers and via the MS\nOneDrive Business service. In particular, for the compuational simulations, larger intermediate\nraw files are typically removed after the post-processing and/or the publication of the results.\nTherefore, the storage requirements related to this project will not be extensive.\n5.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project? How\nwill these costs be covered?\nThe involved research groups have their own data servers and backup systems, which is\ncomplemented by the MS OneDrive Business service. The costs are minimal, related to the\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n3 of 5\nreplacement of faulty hard-disks or small upgrades to the current local storage facilities. The\ncosts related to data storage are envisioned in the budget (0.8euro/GB per year), and will be\ncovered from the available consumables budget.\n5.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not\naccessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nThe experimental data generated during the project will be systematically transferred to the local\nservers and MS OneDrive Business, with restricted access (managed by the local IT team). Only\nthe (co-)promotors and involved researchers have access to the shared folders where the data,\nanalysis files and reports will be stored. Also, credentials are required to log in to local computers\nin the laboratories. The data will be shared within the campus network only between PIs and\nmembers of the research team (PhD students and postdocs). If the need to share with external\ncollaborators arises, we will use the OneDrive Business tool as a secure sharing tool.\n6. Data preservation after the end of the project\n6.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the\nproject? If only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is\nthe case (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...).\nAll the generated data will be stored for at least 10 years after the project ends, with the\nexception of the intermediate raw data genated during the computational simualtions, which will\ngenerally not be retained. Instead, we will retain the scripts from which the data has\nbeen generated. \n6.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)?\nAll data will be stored on the local servers back-up servers owned by and located at the KU\nLeuven, for at least 10 years.\n6.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How\nwill the costs be covered?\nThe system and cost allocation described in section 5.4 will also be used for data preservation\nafter the project ends. Costs are expected to be negligible and will be covered by other running\nprojects from the involved groups (in case of no running projects, accumulated reserves will be\nused).\n7. Data sharing and re-use\n7.1. Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data\n(e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions or because of IP\npotential)?\nThere are no legal restrictions or restriction related to IP potential.\n7.2. Which data will be made available after the end of the project?\nAll data will be made available, for example if requested by the editor or publisher of a scientific\njournal or upon request of an individual (e.g. a researcher who intends to reproduce an\nexperiment).\n7.3. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse?\nIn an Open Access repository\nIn a restricted access repository\nUpon request by mail\nUpon request and after the agreement of the projects promotors, all data can be made\navailable on an open repository (e.g. Zenodo for data), for example if requested by the editor or\npublisher of a scientific journal or via restricted access upon request of an individual (e.g. a\nresearcher who intends to reproduce an experiment).\n7.4. When will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nAfter the research results have been published and after agreement of the (co-)promotors (with a\npossible embargo time no longer than one year after the publication of the research)\nSource codes/scripts will be made available over the duration of the project, after an internal\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n4 of 5\nevaluation on the possible valorization of newly developed codes/methodologies. \n7.5. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions?\nAll involved researchers will have access to all the data. Upon request and after agreement of the\n(co-)promotors, access to the data can be granted to other individuals/parties.\n7.6. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nThere will be no costs for data sharing. Since the volume of most files is not too large, the\nOneDrive Business tool provided by the KU Leuven, or otherwise freeware, will be used to\ntransfer and share the files.\n8. Responsibilities\n8.1. Who will be responsible for the data documentation & metadata?\nThe promoter and co-promoters of the project. \n8.2. Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?\nThe promotor and co-promoters of the project, together with the IT responsibles of the research\ngroups, who are responsible for the implementation of the storage and back up.\n8.3. Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and sharing?\nThe promotor and co-promoters of the project\n8.4. Who bears the end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?\nThe end responsibility for updating and implementing the DMP is with the promotor.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n5 of 5"
