If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. Yes 1. Metadata from experiments - For all samples, identification metadata is created upon registration at FIBEr, according to predefined fields, which is then safely stored in the FIBEr database. (The FIBEr database is accessible to FIBEr users; registration and KU Leuven login required.) - Specific protocol that was used to perform the mechanical test on a certain tissue. For our testing protocols, the FIBEr template is used, provided and reviewed by a member of the FIBEr team. 2. Metadata from parameter optimization - Resulting parameters are always accompanied by a report of the parameter fitting run, indicating settings of the parameter fitting code. - Any in-house developed code is properly annotated and accompanied by a readme-file. 3. Metadata from FE simulations - The simulation software automatically generate metadata for every simulation, according to their own standards. - Any in-house developed code is properly annotated and accompanied by a readme-file. 4. Metadata of general computing code - Any in-house developed code is properly annotated and accompanied by a readme-file. Data is uploaded to ManGO using a custom data acquisition and uploader. A predefined metadata schema is required to be filled out prior to uploading. Created using DMPonline.be.

What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? KU Leuven charges a fixed price per TB on the different storage locations, whereby the average usage is charged on a yearly basis. ManGO: ~ 35€ / TB / year These cost are billed to the users of FIBEr based on how much space they require. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for 10 years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of Which data will be retained for 10 years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? the project?

Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain below) All datasets will be retained for 5 years after the end of the project (and for publications, until 5 years after the work has been published). After this period, the data is handed over the respective PIs. Biological samples are destroyed after mechanical testing and can't be retained due to preservation issues. Created using DMPonline.be.
