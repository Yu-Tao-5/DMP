However, the impacts on cities are quite critical. Short-term rental\naccommodations (STRAs) are affecting urban real estate markets and the already scarce supply\nand affordability of rental housing. Despite the Covid-19 outbreak, STRA digital platforms have\nsought new ways to overcome the crisis, either by building new partnerships with municipalities\nor by encouraging new forms of letting to specific target groups. In light of that, the question of\nhow to regulate tourism and STRAs is still challenging governments and is crucial in the\nacademic and political debate. My work will investigate the intersection of touristification,\nfinancialisation of real estate and neoliberal/entrepreneurial urban governance through a\ncomparative analysis of Brussels, Milan and Dublin. The study will uncover the connection\nbetween tourism and real estate in urban growth strategies and question the role of the\nstateâ€”in particular of local governmentsâ€”in promoting such strategies and regulating the\nSTRA market. To fulfill this objective, the qualitative research design is based on two main\nmethods: policy analysis and semi-structured interviews with key informants (policy-makers,\ninvestors and landlords engaged in the STRA market, and civil society representatives). Besides\nproducing an important scientific contribution, the project will have a great impact on policy\nmaking.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
