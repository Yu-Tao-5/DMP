In this approval application, we \nthoroughly explain how we will pseudonymise the data and which particular safety measures will be \ntaken. \nFocus group interviews: The focus group interviews will be recorded in order to make transcription and \ndata analysis possible. Whilst transcribing these recordings, we will anonymize them right away (only \nfictive name, gender, and age will be kept). To create the fictional name, we will store participants' names \nin a separate, password protected file. This file can only be accessed by the researchers working on this \nproject and will not be distributed to third parties. When the interviews are transcribed, this file will be \ndeleted. \nESM study: We will provide each participant with a unique identification code to link the background \nquestionnaire to the daily dairy checklists.

If so, refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the relevant ethical approval number.☒ Yes, human subject data; provide SMEC or EC approval number: G-2023-6844-R6(AMD) ☐ Yes, animal data; provide ECD reference number: ☐ Yes, dual use; provide approval number: ☐ No Additional information: Data will be collected among young individuals aged 12 to 25. No special categories of personal data will be collected and special attention will be paid to the privacy/anonymity of participants. Ethical approval has been obtained. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 7Will you process personal data4? If so, please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ Leuven privacy register number (G or S number).☒ Yes (provide PRET G-number or EC S-number below) ☐ No Additional information: We will work with pseudonymised/anonymized data and have received ethical approval for this via the PRET platform ( G-2023-6844-R6(AMD) ). In this approval application, we thoroughly explain how we will pseudonymise the data and which particular safety measures will be taken. Focus group interviews: The focus group interviews will be recorded in order to make transcription and data analysis possible. Whilst transcribing these recordings, we will anonymize them right away (only fictive name, gender, and age will be kept). To create the fictional name, we will store participants' names in a separate, password protected file. This file can only be accessed by the researchers working on this project and will not be distributed to third parties. When the interviews are transcribed, this file will be deleted. ESM study: We will provide each participant with a unique identification code to link the background questionnaire to the daily dairy checklists. The identification codes will only be used by the researchers and solely for the purpose of linking participants’ data over different data collection points. All information that allows identification of the participants (e.g., email address) will be kept in a separate data file that will be encrypted and can only be accessed by a password known by the primary researcher. Furthermore, this file will be deleted as soon as the research project is completed. Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin- offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please comment: 4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 8Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements, research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3.Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata .Focus group interviews : -We will provide Word documents with the meaning of the codes. -We will make use of an Nvivo project to generate documentation and metadata. -We will follow the guidelines as described in the following link  https://dam.ukdataservice.ac.uk/media/622387/ukda-datamanagement-nvivo.pdf ESM study: -We will provide a codebook with the naming of the variables, the meaning of the values, and the labels in order to interpret the dataset. This will be generated using SPSS. -R code to analyse our data will be stored in specific R scripts. For both studies, we will publish our materials within our organisation via the shared drive and outside our organization by making use of the Open Science Framework (OSF). We will develop our documents with a special eye for transparency and reproducibility. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: We will make use of the personal (I-drive), shared KU Leuven drive (J-drive) and KU Leuven Onedrive to make our research project visible within our organization. In addition, the Open Science Framework (OSF) will be used as a repository for all materials that can be publicly shared, including code books, anonymized data, and code for analyses. 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored?

Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☒ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) The recordings from the focus groups will be deleted as soon as all interviews are transcribed. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☒ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period?
