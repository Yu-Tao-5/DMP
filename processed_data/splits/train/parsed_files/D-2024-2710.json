Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). For experimental data: All files are named using \"yearmonthday_titleordescription\" formal. The data is generated using standardized protocols saved in a OneNote notebook. To keep the data organized and understandable, every day activities including protocols followed as well as brief results are registered in a OneNote sectionv as digital labnotes. Each page in the OneNote section stands for each month denoted and the experiments are noted per day while being labelled properly. At the end of this project, a readme.txt file will also be created to guide future students through the information recorded and how to navigate it. For biological data: All bacterial samples are labelled with an identifier (eg strain name_plasmid_antibiotic) and stored in 2mL cryotubes at - 80 °C. All the information including their location, sample name, selection markers etc is also noted down in a shared excel sheet.

Yes Some data types already have a standard metadata containing all the technical information that tells one about the settings, for example .fasrq NGS files. These files will be preserved with their original metadata file during the project. For other formats such as .txt, .csv, .xlsx files, section explanations or even an additional tab will be created to explain the data. For any other type of data where a standard metadata is not available, a readme.txt file will be created to explain all the data files as well as explain the analysis according to Dublin Core Metadata. 3.

If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Biological samples: There is sufficient storage space in the -80°C freezers available at Michiels lab. Experimental results : OneDrive at KU Leuven offers 5 TB of data per user. In case of a shortage, network storage is purchased whenever needed. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Biological samples: Unauthorized persons do not have the access to the collection of strains stored in the lab Experimental results: OneDrive storage is linked to my KU Leuven account which is secured by two-factor authentication. Its password is also changed on a regular basis. Rest of the data is stored on the university's secure network drives.

What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Biological samples: The cost of -80°C freezers that are present in the Michiels lab are covered by general lab expenses.
