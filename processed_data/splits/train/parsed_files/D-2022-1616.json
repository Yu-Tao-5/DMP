The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan.

If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7The SharePoint directory, coupled to the MS Teams group, is only accessible to members of this group (in principle only LCE staff members). If required, a private channer could be setup, only accessible to a specific set of people. Regarding physical backups, they could be stored behind locked cabinet doors. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?€0 Hosted on SharePoint and is included in general overhead for the university (KUL) Backups can be made on already owned hard drives that can be reformatted and repurposed. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 115. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).In principle, all data will be stored in the SharePoint directory, which will remain accessible and managed by the LCE research group. There is no motivation to reduce the amount of stored data. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?Online, in the SharePoint directory.

FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 126. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☐ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☐ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☒ Other, please specify: In principle: No. Only in case some experimental data is required to be published alongside a conference or journal article would data be (openly) shared. In that case, see the reply on 6. Data Sharing and Reuse > Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Not applicable Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☒ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify: All confidential design and sales data acquired from BSH that was required to perform the analyses is to remain confidential and is not to be shared with third parties. Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.If required in the context of scientific publications, specific, free accessible SharePoint directories can be setup, which will be included in the articles. This data may not include confidential data. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.In the context of publications, when required (time of submitting or publishing). Other: never. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 Results of prior research on ease of disassembly have always been openly published. All software developed for robotic disassembly experiments will be protected under copyrights. The IP strategy of the research group is to openly publish on achieved performances and adopted methodologies and technologies, whereas the software code developed is only shared under license agreements for specific applications, allowing future research and developments on the topic of robotic disassembly for other applications. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes: What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? €0 Hosted on SharePoint and is included in general overhead for the university (KUL) Backups can be made on already owned hard drives that can be reformatted and repurposed. 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 147.
