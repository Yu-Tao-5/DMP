The Council Fathers, in the Pastoral Constitution\nâ€œGaudium et Spesâ€​ (GS), gave extensive thought to this injustice and proposed some\nprinciples that should form the basis for promoting greater justice and equity in the socio-\neconomic life of people and among nations. Despite important awareness-raising and praxis-\noriented initiatives such as â€œJustitia et Paxâ€​ (1967) which was created â€œto stimulate the\nCatholic Community to foster progress in needy regions and social justice on the international\nsceneâ€​ (GS 90), poverty on the African continent has remained endemic. Using literary and\narchival sources alongside oral history, this research aims (1) to interpret these conciliar\nprinciples in order (2) to map out how the post-conciliar Roman Catholic Church in Africa has\nworked to find solutions to the challenges of poverty and underdevelopment, which initiatives\nhave worked, and which have failed. The Church profiles herself in Africa as an institution that is\non the side of the poor. This research will examine how the Church in Africa understood the social\nmandate she received at Vatican II and how she attempted to make it an integral part of her\nsocial apostolate. This historical project will thus provide the basis for the generation of insights\nthat will help to enhance the Churchâ€™s commitment to social transformation and integral\ndevelopment in Africa.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
