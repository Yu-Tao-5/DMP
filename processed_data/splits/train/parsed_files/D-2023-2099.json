It is difficult to treat clinically and is not restricted to the devastating pneumonia\nresulting from covid-19 infections. Thus, there is an urgent need for anti-inflammatory therapies that apply to covid-19 but also to the\nmany inflammatory disorders affecting humans. During evolution, ticks had to circumvent an attack by the immune system of their\nmammalian host. As such, ticks developed mechanisms that reduce inflammation while they feed on their host. One family of proteins\nthat belongs to this anti-inflammatory system are the evasins. Evasins bind to chemokines, proteins that are crucial to attract leukocytes\nto the site of inflammation. There is, however, limited knowledge on the mechanisms evasins use to reduce the effects of chemokines in\nvivo. Do they only block interactions of chemokines with their G protein-coupled receptors? Do they affect chemokine presentation\non glycosaminoglycans? Do they also influence the activity of chemokines by interfering with chemokine processing? A joint doctoral\nstudent between the universities of Leuven and Maastricht will use the complementary expertise of both groups and produce evasins and\nchemokines by chemical peptide synthesis. The potential interference of the evasins with the inflammatory activity of chemokines and its\ninfluence on the regulation of posttranslational chemokine processing will be investigated. Site-specific fluorescent labelling of evasins\nand chemokines in Maastricht will allow to investigate mechanisms of action in acute injury models in Leuven by intravital microscopy.\nMoreover, the therapeutic potential of evasins to treat acute liver injury will be evaluated.\nLast modified: \n27-03-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
