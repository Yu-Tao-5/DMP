If so, please describe these issues further \nand refer to specific datasets or data types \nwhen appropriate.☐ Yes, human subject data\n☐ Yes, animal data\n☐ Yes, dual use \n☒ No\nIf yes, please describe:\n5 These data are generated by combining multiple existing datasets.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 6Will  you  process  personal  data6?  If  so,  briefly \ndescribe the kind of personal data you will use.  \nPlease refer to specific datasets or data types  \nwhen appropriate. If available, add the reference  \nto  your  file  in  your  host  institution's  privacy  \nregister.☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes:\n-Short description of the kind of personal data that will be used:\n-Privacy Registry Reference:\nDoes your work have potential for commercial \nvalorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-\noffs, commercial exploitation, …)?  \nIf so, please comment per dataset or data type \nwhere appropriate.☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes, please comment:  \nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict \nexploitation or dissemination of the data you \n(re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements,  \nresearch collaboration agreements)?  \nIf so, please explain to what data they relate and  \nwhat restrictions are in place.☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes, please explain:  \nAre there any other legal issues, such as \nintellectual property rights and ownership, to be  \nmanaged related to the data you (re)use?  \nIf so, please explain to what data they relate and  \nwhich restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes, please explain:  \n6 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 73.Documentation and Metadata\nClearly describe what approach will be followed  \nto  capture  the  accompanying  information  \nnecessary  to  keep  data  understandable  and  \nusable, for yourself and others, now and in the  \nfuture (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and  \ntypes required, procedures used, Electronic Lab  \nNotebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc.  \nwhere this information is recorded).Literature notes will be titled by reference to the author, year and title of the text, in order to maximize \nsearchability and order. Furthermore, these documents will start out with the relevant bibliographical \ninformation.\nPhD-chapters in progress, draft documents, drafts of articles and conference presentations  will be \nlabelled as such, and will be categorized by date, chapter and thus subject.  \nBibliographical data and reading lists will include the following info: type of publication, author(s), \neditor(s), title, title of journal or book of publication, volume of the book or issue of the journal, the pages,  \nthe year of publication, the place of publication, the publisher, the DOI.\nFinal journal articles, book chapters and the final thesis will be categorized by type and given the relevant  \ntitle, including the year of publication/defence.\nWill a metadata standard be used to make it \neasier to find and reuse the data ? \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard \nwill be used.

The data will be stored on the drive of my research laptop, on my KU Leuven OneDrive account and will be  \nfrequently backed up on an external HDD which I will purchase with my bench fee.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nWHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO \nPREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA \nAND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP \nDIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7\nREFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP \nPROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.As noted, the data will be automatically and instantaneously backed up on the KU Leuven OneDrive, and \nbacked up frequently (weekly at the minimum) on an external HDD.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.☒ Yes\n☐ No\nIf yes, please specify concisely:\nSince I am not planning on acquiring more than a few GB’s of data, almost any HDD and the KU Leuven \nOneDrive (where I have 2 TB of storage) will be more than sufficient for my research purposes.\nIf no, please specify:  \n7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric:  https://osf.io/2z5g3/\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9How will you ensure that the data are securely \nstored and not accessed or modified by \nunauthorized persons?\nCLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, \nNETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND \nFILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND \nTRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7OneDrive is connected to KU Leuven’s security portal, which is only accessible with a password and an \nadditional confirmation on my personal cellphone (‘KU Leuven Authenticator’). The work laptop can only \nbe accessed with both a pin code and a password, and it is furthermore at all times safely stored in my \noffice (which is locked when I am away) or at home. I will secure the HDD with a password as well and \nstore it analogously to my laptop.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?KU Leuven provides the OneDrive storage to all its researchers. The laptop and HDD are bought through \nthe bench fee, costing €748,07 for the laptop (which naturally serves various functions besides storage) \nand approximately €70,- for the HDD (this naturally being only a prognosis, since it has not yet been \nbought).\n5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five \nyears (or longer, in agreement with other \nretention policies that are applicable) after the \nend of the project? In case some data cannot be  \npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this  \n(e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All the previously mentioned data will be retained for that period.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10Where will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long-term)?I will retain all the mentioned data on my laptop’s hard drive, on the external HDD and, additionally, on a \npersonal Google Drive and on the open access data depository Open Science Framework (osf.io).\nFurthermore, the thesis, book chapter(s) and journal articles will, besides the previously mentioned \nstorage locations, also be stored in Lirias (“Leuven Institutional Repository and Information Archiving \nSystem”). For published articles, there are sometimes copyright restrictions on making them available in \nopen access in the first 12 months. Naturally, the law will be followed in that regard.\nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during the expected retention \nperiod? How will these costs be covered?There will be no additional costs, considering the purchases will have been made using the bench fee, and \nthe fact that below 15 GB of data (and it is very unlikely the storage quantity of my research data will \nincrease to that number), storage on Google Drive is free.  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 116. Data Sharing and Reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made \navailable for reuse after/during the project?  \nPlease explain per dataset or data type which \ndata will be made available.  \nNOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE \nDATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS \nAND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS \nBOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: \nHTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF   \nOEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS  ☒ Yes, in an Open Access repository\n☐ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …)\n☐ No (closed access)\n☐ Other, please specify:\nAll data sets will be made available in open access, with the exception of specific articles which might not \nyet be legally allowed to be made available in that way. Nevertheless, even with those articles, that \nmeasure will be taken after the legal embargo period of 12 months. During that period, the access will be \nrestricted to those who have institutional or personal access to the journal in question.\nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be \nable to access the data and under what \nconditions.See above.\nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the  \nsharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in \nan agreement with a 3rd party, legal \nrestrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data \ntype where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects\n☒ Yes, intellectual property rights\n☐ Yes, ethical aspects  \n☐ Yes, aspects of dual use\n☐ Yes, other\n☐ No\nIf yes, please specify:  \nSee above (i.e., the only restrictions are on journal articles within the embargo period).\nWhere will the data be made available?  \nIf already known, please provide a repository \nper dataset or data type.As stated, data will be made available through Lirias (published documents and my thesis) and OSF \n(everything), within the legal boundaries. Furthermore, I will make available all data upon request by \nemail.\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12When will the data be made available?\nTHIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION \nSUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.Articles and book chapters will be made available after the embargo period, if relevant. My thesis will \nbecome available upon a successful defence (which realistically will be held towards the end of 2026 or \nearly 2027). My other data I will make available after I finish my project, which is planned to be October \n31, 2026.\nWhich data usage licenses are you going to \nprovide? If none, please explain why.\nA DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE \nREUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS \nGRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY \nREUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A \nLICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER \nANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT.\nEXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE \nSHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS \nATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE \nCREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8  Data from the project that can be shared will be made available under a creative commons attribution \nlicense (CC-BY 4.0), so that users have to give credit to the original data creators.\nDo you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession \nnumber to your dataset(s)? If already available, \nplease provide it here.\nINDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE \nIDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes:\n8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric:  https://osf.io/2z5g3/\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13What are the expected costs for data sharing? \nHow will these costs be covered?  There are no expected costs, as Lirias is a free KU Leuven service. OSF is equally free.\n7. Responsibilities\nWho will manage data documentation and \nmetadata during the research project?Rik Ouwerkerk\nWho will manage data storage and backup \nduring the research project?Rik Ouwerkerk\nWho will manage data preservation and \nsharing?Rik Ouwerkerk and Ernst Wolff\nWho will update and implement this DMP?

Bibliographical data and reading lists will include the following info: type of publication, author(s), editor(s), title, title of journal or book of publication, volume of the book or issue of the journal, the pages, the year of publication, the place of publication, the publisher, the DOI. Final journal articles, book chapters and the final thesis will be categorized by type and given the relevant title, including the year of publication/defence. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: See above for a full outline. 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 8Where will the data be stored? The data will be stored on the drive of my research laptop, on my KU Leuven OneDrive account and will be frequently backed up on an external HDD which I will purchase with my bench fee. How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.As noted, the data will be automatically and instantaneously backed up on the KU Leuven OneDrive, and backed up frequently (weekly at the minimum) on an external HDD. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: Since I am not planning on acquiring more than a few GB’s of data, almost any HDD and the KU Leuven OneDrive (where I have 2 TB of storage) will be more than sufficient for my research purposes. If no, please specify: 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7OneDrive is connected to KU Leuven’s security portal, which is only accessible with a password and an additional confirmation on my personal cellphone (‘KU Leuven Authenticator’). The work laptop can only be accessed with both a pin code and a password, and it is furthermore at all times safely stored in my office (which is locked when I am away) or at home. I will secure the HDD with a password as well and store it analogously to my laptop. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?KU Leuven provides the OneDrive storage to all its researchers. The laptop and HDD are bought through the bench fee, costing €748,07 for the laptop (which naturally serves various functions besides storage) and approximately €70,- for the HDD (this naturally being only a prognosis, since it has not yet been bought). 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).All the previously mentioned data will be retained for that period. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?I will retain all the mentioned data on my laptop’s hard drive, on the external HDD and, additionally, on a personal Google Drive and on the open access data depository Open Science Framework (osf.io). Furthermore, the thesis, book chapter(s) and journal articles will, besides the previously mentioned storage locations, also be stored in Lirias (“Leuven Institutional Repository and Information Archiving System”). For published articles, there are sometimes copyright restrictions on making them available in open access in the first 12 months. Naturally, the law will be followed in that regard. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?There will be no additional costs, considering the purchases will have been made using the bench fee, and the fact that below 15 GB of data (and it is very unlikely the storage quantity of my research data will increase to that number), storage on Google Drive is free. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 116. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☐ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: All data sets will be made available in open access, with the exception of specific articles which might not yet be legally allowed to be made available in that way. Nevertheless, even with those articles, that measure will be taken after the legal embargo period of 12 months. During that period, the access will be restricted to those who have institutional or personal access to the journal in question. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.See above. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☒ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify: See above (i.e., the only restrictions are on journal articles within the embargo period). Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.As stated, data will be made available through Lirias (published documents and my thesis) and OSF (everything), within the legal boundaries. Furthermore, I will make available all data upon request by email. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 12When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.Articles and book chapters will be made available after the embargo period, if relevant. My thesis will become available upon a successful defence (which realistically will be held towards the end of 2026 or early 2027). My other data I will make available after I finish my project, which is planned to be October 31, 2026. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 Data from the project that can be shared will be made available under a creative commons attribution license (CC-BY 4.0), so that users have to give credit to the original data creators. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes: 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? There are no expected costs, as Lirias is a free KU Leuven service. OSF is equally free. 7.
