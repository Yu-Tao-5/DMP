In scaled devices even the smallest variations of the structural dimensions,\nprocess conditions, carrier distribution and activation rate can cause significant variations in the devices’ electrical properties. For this\nreason, it is crucial that Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) simulations are calibrated to accurate metrology data obtained from\nthe inside of real-world devices, enhancing the prediction accuracy, and reducing the necessity for conducting multiple costly\nexperimental iterations. The project focuses on combining the development of scalpel Scanning Spreading Resistance Microscopy (s-\nSSRM) for gate-all-around transistors, a currently absent capability, with TCAD calibration. Additional inputs from other metrology\ntechniques, such as Transmission Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersion X-Ray spectroscopy, Nano-Beam electron Diffraction and\ndevice current-voltage characteristics, will also be implemented into the TCAD simulations. By combining advanced metrology with\ncalibrated TCAD simulations, predictions will be available with accuracy levels unattainable through other means, as well as a very cost-\nefficient tool for design optimization.\nID: \nID: \n212949\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-11-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n31-10-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n20-02-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
