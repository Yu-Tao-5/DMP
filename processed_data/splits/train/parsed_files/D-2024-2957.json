However, most of these studies have used explicit measures of L2 knowledge, such as multiple choice vocabulary\ntests and untimed grammaticality judgements. The present proposal aims to advance our understanding of the input-acquisition\nrelationship by investigating the mechanisms underlying explicit and implicit language learning by English-as-Foreign-Language (EFL)\nlearners who are exposed to large amounts of English language input outside of school, but have not started formal English instruction\nyet. In two correlational studies, we will investigate the relationship between (i) extramural English and (ii) explicit and implicit word and\ngrammar knowledge. Further, in two longitudinal studies, we will study their development of explicit and implicit word and\ngrammar knowledge in English.\nID: \nID: \n211364\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-10-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n01-10-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n17-12-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

These data include demographic information, such as name, month and year of birth, gender, SES, language context, and engagement with English activities. In order to protect the participants' privacy, the collected data will be pseudonymized. Each participant will be assigned a unique code. Their name, class group, school, province, and other personal data that can identify a participant, will be stored along with that unique code in a key code. Hence, those data will not be linked to the other data, unless participants wish to exercise their right of access to the data. The results of the questionnaires and tests will be stored in a second document. The PhD student will have access to both the key code and the pseudonymized dataset.
