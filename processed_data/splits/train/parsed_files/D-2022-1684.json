Third-party litigation funding (“TPLF”) sees parties unrelated to the dispute, “invest” in selected lawsuits hoping to make a profit.\nDespite being presented as a means to enhance access to justice, TPLF is increasingly used in high-value commercial litigation to\nsupport entities that are capable of bearing the costs of litigation. This comes with the risk of driving away funders from providing\nsupport to parties whose right of access to justice depends upon obtaining litigation financing. This is notably the case of Strategic\nPublic Interest Litigation (“SPIL”). One of the main issues of SPIL is the lack of funding. Against this background, this PhD aims at\nidentifying how TPLF, a market that is still largely unregulated, can be the most useful to secure an effective access to justice, in\nparticular in SPIL. To that end, this PhD includes three work packages: (i) investigate the requirements which the ECtHR and the CJEU\nimpose upon litigation funding in the context of access to courts, in particular in SPIL cases; (ii) catalogue the regulatory and judicial\nresponses to specific issues surrounding the use of TPLF in selected jurisdictions, (iii) draw up a blueprint for EU rules on TPLF, against\nthe background of access to justice and the increasing relevance of SPIL in the EU.\nID: \nID: \n209477\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-10-2023\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n31-03-2027\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n05-09-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
