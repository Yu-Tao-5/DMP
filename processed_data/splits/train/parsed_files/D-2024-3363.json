The study aims to elucidate mechanisms governing energy\ntransport, turbulent plasma dynamics, and plasma transport across the magnetosphere, with a particular emphasis on the role of\nelectrons in small-scale processes. The investigation encompasses comprehensive analyses of electron energization, turbulent plasma\ndynamics, and plasma transport dynamics in the local and global evolution of the KHI. Each component of the study addresses specific\naspects of plasma physics relevant to space weather prediction and understanding fundamental processes in magnetospheric\nenvironments. The proposal emphasizes the need for high-resolution kinetic simulations to capture small-scale physics accurately and\nunderscores the importance of addressing this gap in current research to improve our ability to forecast space weather and understand\nthe underlying physical processes driving plasma dynamics in space.\nID: \nID: \n212518\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-11-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n31-10-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n30-01-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
