The genetic control over deterministic phenotype changes\nhas been studied in detail: we know how transcription factors can induce differentiation and how\nmutations can drive oncogenic transformation. However, for accommodating such changes, cells\nneed to control the plasticity of their phenotype through processes that are far less understood.\nAdvancements in single cell-omics enable us to measure cell-intrinsic stochastic heterogeneity. I\nhypothesize that this aspect of transcriptional heterogeneity is epigenetically regulated, and\ncontrols acquisition of therapy resistance. To test this hypothesis, I am combining CRISPR and\nepigenetic inhibitor screens with single cell RNA and ATAC-seq. I will measure how altering\nepigenetic enzyme activity affects stochastic and deterministic cellular heterogeneity. Next, the\nrole of epigenetic drivers of heterogeneity in therapy response will be validated by assessing how\nthey affect drug tolerance of cancer cells, and whether reducing heterogeneity curbs resistance\nacquisition. Lastly, I will quantify the influence of defined â€œsignatures of heterogeneityâ€​ on\ntherapy outcome in patients. I will be focusing specifically lung adenocarcinoma cells, because\nthey notoriously have a heterogenous phenotypic composition. My ultimate aim is to improve\npatient outcome by understanding the mechanisms that drive tumor heterogeneity.

Raw and processed sequencing data (.xfastq: .txt: .bam) will be transferred to a public repository (EBI ArrayExpress). Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? In an Open Access repository Upon request by mail Upon manuscript submission, raw and processed sequencing data (.fastq; .txt; .bam) will be transferred to a public repository (EBI ArrayExpress). From the project onset, data documentation will be tailored for deposition in public repositories, with spreadsheet headers corresponding to fields required by these repositories. All methods used will be documented in sufficient detail to allow for independent replication. When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results This document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) 6 of 7 Relevant raw data will be transferred to a public repository upon publication of the research results in established, peer-reviewed academic journals. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? Relevant raw data to publications in journal articles will be available in a public repository upon publication.
