Our preliminary data show that PERK\nshapes T cell metabolism and effector functions. Here, I will use state of the art molecular/cellular biology tools, a recently developed\nmicrofluidic system, and transgenic mice with a specific deletion of Perk in T cells as in vivo models to study the role of\nPERK in T cell metabolic reprogramming and anti-tumor immunity, and decipher the mechanistic underpinnings related to its role as\ncoordinator of MCSs or the UPR.

This file will be located in the top level directory of the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files and outline the file-naming convention used. This will allow\nthe data to be understood by other members of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future reuse.\n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 28 April 2023\n3 of 6\nDigital files will be stored on KU Leuven servers.\n- Omics data: omics data generated during the project will either be stored on KU Leuven servers or on The Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC), initially in the staging area\nand later in the archive area.\n- Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria\nglycerol stock (-80°C). All published vectors and the associated sequences will be sent to the non-profit plasmid repository Addgene, which will take care of vector storage and\nshipping upon request.\n- Cell lines: Newly created human cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid\nnitrogen storage and will be deposited in the UZ Leuven-KU Leuven Biobank. Other human cell lines will be stored locally in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory when\nactively used for experiments. Animal cell lines will be stored in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory.\n- Bacterial and yeast strains will be stored in a -80°C freezer in the lab of Patrizia Agostinis. Costs are covered by general lab expenses.\n- Genetically modified organisms: Mice will be maintained in facilities of the Laboratory Animal Center of KU Leuven, which applies Standard Operation Procedures concerning\nhousing, feeding, health monitoring to assure consistent care in accordance with European and national regulations and guidelines. All animals will be registered in the Leuven\nAnimal Information System (LAIS) database, along with corresponding genotyping information, ethical approval documents and animal provider receipts.\n- Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate.\n- Algorithms, scripts and softwares: All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software code driving the project will be stored in a private online git repository from the GitHub\naccount of the department (https://github.com/vibcbd).\nHow will the data be backed up?\nKU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme:\n- data stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all\nincremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept.\n- data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept.\n- data stored on the digital vault is backed up using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. As standard, 10% of\nthe requested storage is reserved for backups using the following backup regime: an hourly backup (at 8 a.m., 12 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.), the last 6 of which are kept; a daily\nbackup (every day) at midnight, the last 6 of which are kept; and a weekly backup (every week) at midnight between Saturday and Sunday, the last 2 of which are kept.\n- All omics data stored on the Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC) will be transferred on a weekly basis to the archive area which is backed up.\nIncremental backups are done daily from one 20 TB QNAP NAS to a second 20 TB QNAP NAS.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThere is sufficient storage and back-up capacity on all KU Leuven servers:\n- the “L-drive” is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster with NetApp eseries storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front-\nend.\n- the “J-drive” is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controlers with an Ontap 9.1P9 operating system.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nBoth the “L-drive” and “J-drive” servers are accessible only by laboratory members, and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery\nso that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour.\nAccess to the digital vault is possible only through using a KU Leuven user-id and password, and user rights only grant access to the data in their own vault. Sensitive data\ntransfer will be performed according to the best practices for “Copying data to the secure environment” defined by KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault is maintained on\na monthly basis, including the application of upgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound by the ICT code of\nconduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. A security service monitors the technical installations continuously, even outside working hours.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nEach year €738 will be charged from our ICT service for the use of 5 TB on the L-drive (long term storage) and €51,9 will be charged each year for the use of 100 GB of the J-\ndrive (short term storage). Back-up service is included in the price. For the K-drive (data archive) storage space of 1 TB is foreseen and will cost €128 each year, this is also\nexpandable in blocks of 100 GB. These costs were foreseen in the application and if more the lab budget will be used to cover these expenses.\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some\ndata cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\nThe minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets. All datasets will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic\nback-up procedures for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. The costs (€156 per TB per year for “Large volume-storage” ) will be covered by the lab.\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nAs a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing\nplatforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), such as MIFlowCyt (https://fairsharing.org/3518) for flow cytometry, OME\n(https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.cq8tg2) for microscopy and  ARRIVE (https://arriveguidelines.org/) for animal experiments, at the latest at the time of\npublication.\nFor all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows:\n-Digital datasets: files will be stored on the “L-drive”.\n-Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory.\n-Omics data: datasets will be stored on the “L-drive” or, for larger datasets, on the Vlaams\nSupercomputer Centrum.\n-Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 28 April 2023\n4 of 6\nglycerol stock (-80°C).\n-Cell lines: human cell lines will be stored in the UZ Leuven Biobank (-80°C). Animal cell lines will be stored in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory.\n-Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate.\n- Following publication, the results associated with each study will also be deposited in the Dryad repository, where they will be preserved indefinitely.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nEach year €128 will be charged from our ICT service for the use of 1 TB on the k-drive (long term storage), back-up service is included in the price. These costs were foreseen in\nthe budget request of the application and if more, the lab budget will be used to cover these expenses.\n5. Data sharing and reuse\nWill the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?  In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data\nwill be made available.\nYes, in an Open Access repository\nOther, please specify:\nUpon request by email.\nParticipants to the present project are committed to publish research results to communicate them to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications\nwill be made openly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or\npotential new collaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. negative data).\nWe aim at communicating our results in top journals that require full disclosure upon publication of all included data, either in the main text, in supplementary material or in a data\nrepository if requested by the journal and following deposit advice given by the journal. Depending on the\njournal, accessibility restrictions may apply.\nBiological material will be distributed to other parties if requested.\nIf access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.\nN/A\nAre there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in\nthe comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate.\nNo\nWhere will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.\nData submission wizards such as EMBL-EBI  (www.ebi.ac.uk/submission) will be used to choose the right archive for the data generated in this project. In case there is not good\ndisciplinary repository KU Leuven RDR (www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr/) will be used.\nWhen will the data be made available?\nUpon publication of the research results\nAs a general rule all research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at the time of publication. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending\npublications, potential IP requirements – note that patent application filing will be planned so that publications need not be delayed - or ongoing projects requiring confidential\ndata. In those cases, datasets will be made publicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached.\nWhich data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why.\nCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) will be used unless the final repository used suggests another usage license.\nDo you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section.\nYes\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?\nIt is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the\nproject, and by using free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. A budget for\npublication costs has been requested in this project.\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 28 April 2023\n5 of 6\n6.

Other human cell lines will be stored locally in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory when actively used for experiments. Animal cell lines will be stored in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory. - Bacterial and yeast strains will be stored in a -80°C freezer in the lab of Patrizia Agostinis. Costs are covered by general lab expenses. - Genetically modified organisms: Mice will be maintained in facilities of the Laboratory Animal Center of KU Leuven, which applies Standard Operation Procedures concerning housing, feeding, health monitoring to assure consistent care in accordance with European and national regulations and guidelines. All animals will be registered in the Leuven Animal Information System (LAIS) database, along with corresponding genotyping information, ethical approval documents and animal provider receipts. - Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate. - Algorithms, scripts and softwares: All the relevant algorithms, scripts and software code driving the project will be stored in a private online git repository from the GitHub account of the department (https://github.com/vibcbd). How will the data be backed up? KU Leuven drives are backed-up according to the following scheme: - data stored on the “L-drive” is backed up daily using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online; the last 14 backups are kept. - data stored on the “J-drive” is backed up hourly, daily (every day at midnight) and weekly (at midnight between Saturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept. - data stored on the digital vault is backed up using snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version are kept online. As standard, 10% of the requested storage is reserved for backups using the following backup regime: an hourly backup (at 8 a.m., 12 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.), the last 6 of which are kept; a daily backup (every day) at midnight, the last 6 of which are kept; and a weekly backup (every week) at midnight between Saturday and Sunday, the last 2 of which are kept. - All omics data stored on the Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC) will be transferred on a weekly basis to the archive area which is backed up. Incremental backups are done daily from one 20 TB QNAP NAS to a second 20 TB QNAP NAS. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes There is sufficient storage and back-up capacity on all KU Leuven servers: - the “L-drive” is an easily scalable system, built from General Parallel File System (GPFS) cluster with NetApp eseries storage systems, and a CTDB samba cluster in the front- end. - the “J-drive” is based on a cluster of NetApp FAS8040 controlers with an Ontap 9.1P9 operating system. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Both the “L-drive” and “J-drive” servers are accessible only by laboratory members, and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. Access to the digital vault is possible only through using a KU Leuven user-id and password, and user rights only grant access to the data in their own vault. Sensitive data transfer will be performed according to the best practices for “Copying data to the secure environment” defined by KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of upgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound by the ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. A security service monitors the technical installations continuously, even outside working hours. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Each year €738 will be charged from our ICT service for the use of 5 TB on the L-drive (long term storage) and €51,9 will be charged each year for the use of 100 GB of the J- drive (short term storage). Back-up service is included in the price. For the K-drive (data archive) storage space of 1 TB is foreseen and will cost €128 each year, this is also expandable in blocks of 100 GB. These costs were foreseen in the application and if more the lab budget will be used to cover these expenses. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). The minimum preservation term of 5 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets. All datasets will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic back-up procedures for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. The costs (€156 per TB per year for “Large volume-storage” ) will be covered by the lab. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), such as MIFlowCyt (https://fairsharing.org/3518) for flow cytometry, OME (https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.cq8tg2) for microscopy and ARRIVE (https://arriveguidelines.org/) for animal experiments, at the latest at the time of publication. For all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows: -Digital datasets: files will be stored on the “L-drive”. -Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the laboratory. -Omics data: datasets will be stored on the “L-drive” or, for larger datasets, on the Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum. -Vectors: As a general rule at least two independently obtained clones will be preserved for each vector, both under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 28 April 2023 4 of 6 glycerol stock (-80°C). -Cell lines: human cell lines will be stored in the UZ Leuven Biobank (-80°C). Animal cell lines will be stored in liquid nitrogen cryostorage of the laboratory. -Other biological and chemical samples: storage at 4°C and/or as frozen samples in cryovials as appropriate. - Following publication, the results associated with each study will also be deposited in the Dryad repository, where they will be preserved indefinitely. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? Each year €128 will be charged from our ICT service for the use of 1 TB on the k-drive (long term storage), back-up service is included in the price. These costs were foreseen in the budget request of the application and if more, the lab budget will be used to cover these expenses. 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in an Open Access repository Other, please specify: Upon request by email. Participants to the present project are committed to publish research results to communicate them to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be made openly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new collaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. negative data). We aim at communicating our results in top journals that require full disclosure upon publication of all included data, either in the main text, in supplementary material or in a data repository if requested by the journal and following deposit advice given by the journal. Depending on the journal, accessibility restrictions may apply. Biological material will be distributed to other parties if requested. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. N/A Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. No Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. Data submission wizards such as EMBL-EBI (www.ebi.ac.uk/submission) will be used to choose the right archive for the data generated in this project. In case there is not good disciplinary repository KU Leuven RDR (www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr/) will be used. When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results As a general rule all research outputs will be made openly accessible at the latest at the time of publication. No embargo will be foreseen unless imposed e.g. by pending publications, potential IP requirements – note that patent application filing will be planned so that publications need not be delayed - or ongoing projects requiring confidential data. In those cases, datasets will be made publicly available as soon as the embargo date is reached. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) will be used unless the final repository used suggests another usage license. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. Yes What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free-to-use data repositories and dissemination facilities whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. A budget for publication costs has been requested in this project. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 28 April 2023 5 of 6 6.
