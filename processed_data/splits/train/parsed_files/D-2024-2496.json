The FWO expects a completed \nDMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research \nco-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the \nsupervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal.

STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used: If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: The metadata of the generated software includes programming language, author, version, date of creation,... Such metadata is automatically created by a git repository like KU Leuven GitLab. 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 8Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data.☒ Shared network drive (J-drive) Benchmark datasets ☒ Personal network drive (I-drive) Benchmark datasets ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) Benchmark datasets ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☐ Other: Intensive care unit acquired-weakness: my own hard drive How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? ☒ Standard back-up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☒ Personal back-ups I make (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data Hard drive of my laptop: has a bitlocker, laptop itself is password-protected. OneDrive for Business: secured by two-factor authentication. KU Leuven GitLab: secured by two-factor authentication. The latter 2 storage media are supported by the KU Leuven infrastructure, and are ensured to stay within a datacenter in Europe FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?No substantial costs for storage are expected. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) The reused patient data can not legally be preserved by us after the research project. The responsible for the preservation of the intensive care unit acquired weakness data is Dr. Ir. Fabian Güiza Gandas. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☒ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): Github repositories What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?The expected costs for preservation are negligible and will be covered by the budget of the PI. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 106. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☐ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: Raw data reused in this project and processed data will not be made available for legal and ethical reasons. The processed data can easily be recovered from the raw data using the software code generated during this project. Analysed data will be included in a publication, possibly as supplemental materials. Code may be made available on a project-per-project basis, e.g. in a hosted Git repository. Access to these repositories will not be restricted, as they do not consist of sensitive personal data (although care must be taken to curate the analysed data, e.g. graphs and tables, to fulfil this condition). If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Not applicable Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☒ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☒ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☐ No If yes, please specify: Data related to intensive care unit acquired weakness may not be shared to 3rd parties without the permission of my collaborator Fabian Güiza Grandas FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☐ KU Leuven RDR ☒ Other data repository (specify) ☐ Other (specify) In an Open Access repository, such as GitHub. When will the data be made available? ☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. Check the RDR guidance on licences for data and software sources code or consult the License selector tool to help you choose. ☐ CC-BY 4.0 (data) ☐ Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data) ☐ MIT licence (code) ☐ GNU GPL-3.0 (code) ☒ Other (specify) The exact license of the software has to be decided and will be discussed with LRD. For internal use in the research group, the software will be stored on the network drives. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☒ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☐ No A DOI can be generated for any GitHub repositories What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? No costs for data sharing are expected, creation of a public GitHub repository is free. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 127.
