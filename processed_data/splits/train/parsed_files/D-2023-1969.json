The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Tine Deconinck https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2353-3363  \nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Dirk Daelemans (Promotor)  https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7092-1153  \nFrederik De Smet (Co-promotor) https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6669-3335  \nProject number1 & title 11M2423N Combinatorial and personalized oncolytic virotherapy in the battle against glioblastoma\nFunder(s) GrantID2FWO \nAffiliation(s) ☒ KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nProvide ROR3 identifier when possible:  Rega Institute (https://ror.org/03w5j8p12 )\nPlease provide a short project description Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive type of brain cancer with poor survival due to tumor recurrence  \nin almost all patients. Current treatment options are limited and can only slow down disease, thus novel  \nintervention strategies are highly needed. Oncolytic virotherapy (OVT) is a strategy with great potential for  \ndifficult-to-treat cancers. However, despite promising preclinical results, no oncolytic virus (OV) is associated  \nwith encouraging clinical results in GBM patients yet. Reasons for these suboptimal clinical results are the  \nlimited understanding of virological aspects of OVT, the lack of patient stratification, the use of cellular  \nmodels that do not represent human GBM biology, and the use of one single type of OVT. Therefore, in this  \nproposed project, I will identify the cellular host factors important for response of three clinically relevant  \nOVs in patient-derived GBM cell lines through genome wide CRISPR/Cas9 KO screening. These predictive  \nbiomarkers will allow patient stratification to the OV that best suits their tumor characteristics. The high  \ninter- and intratumoral heterogeneity of GBM may require combinations of OVs to avoid emergence of  \nresistant subtypes. Therefore, I will match different GBM subtypes with their appropriate OV and combine  \nOVs with different mechanisms of action to reduce the emergence of resistant tumor clones. In conclusion,  \nthis project aims at maximizing the efficacy of OVT in GBM treatment by exploring new options for  \npersonalized and combinatorial therapy.\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number. This question is optional since not every institution has an internal project number different from the GrantID. Applicants can \nonly provide one project number.  2 Funder(s) GrantID refers to the number of the DMP at the funder(s), here one can specify multiple GrantIDs if multiple funding sources were used.3 Research Organization Registry Community. https://ror.org/\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 32.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

    "clean_full_text": "FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 1FWO DMP Template - Flemish Standard Data Management Plan Project supervisors (from application round 2018 onwards) and fellows (from application round 2020 onwards) will, upon being awarded their project or fellowship, be invited to develop their answers to the data management related questions into a DMP. The FWO expects a completed DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but to the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. At the end of the project, the final version of the DMP has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by the supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an element in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start date and the final DMP may use this template. The DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This Flemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all Flemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core requirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of definitions and abbreviations is available via the following link.

Current treatment options are limited and can only slow down disease, thus novel intervention strategies are highly needed. Oncolytic virotherapy (OVT) is a strategy with great potential for difficult-to-treat cancers. However, despite promising preclinical results, no oncolytic virus (OV) is associated with encouraging clinical results in GBM patients yet. Reasons for these suboptimal clinical results are the limited understanding of virological aspects of OVT, the lack of patient stratification, the use of cellular models that do not represent human GBM biology, and the use of one single type of OVT. Therefore, in this proposed project, I will identify the cellular host factors important for response of three clinically relevant OVs in patient-derived GBM cell lines through genome wide CRISPR/Cas9 KO screening. These predictive biomarkers will allow patient stratification to the OV that best suits their tumor characteristics. The high inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity of GBM may require combinations of OVs to avoid emergence of resistant subtypes. Therefore, I will match different GBM subtypes with their appropriate OV and combine OVs with different mechanisms of action to reduce the emergence of resistant tumor clones. In conclusion, this project aims at maximizing the efficacy of OVT in GBM treatment by exploring new options for personalized and combinatorial therapy. 1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.
