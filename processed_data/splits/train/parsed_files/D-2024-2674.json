These algorithms realize\nspecific functionalities such as noise reduction, dereverberation, dynamic range compression, adaptive feedback cancellation, and active noise control.\nWhile there has been a significant advance in the technology of such DSP functionalities, different DSP functionalities are mostly developed and\nanalyzed in isolation.

Last modiﬁed 23 February 2024 2 of 10 possible, closed as necessary' principle will be adhered to. To gain more insights into good practices for data management, I have followed a 'research data management' seminar, as well as a seminar on 'open science'. By acting on the acquired insights of these seminars, the entire required DMP for the FWO has already been completed since I believe a well-defined DMP aids the organization of the project.

Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? The data will be stored on ESAT servers, of which the access is regulated by an access control list (ACL) that grants: - read-write access to the project owner - read-only access to specific users The ACL is managed by the promotor and STADIUS Data manager. Client computers can access the data using: - SMB2 (or higher) from specific IP ranges - NFSv4 from specific (IT managed) systems Code and manuscripts will additionally be saved to GitLab repositories. Data of the behavioural listening tests will be made available, depending on the informed consent, using KU Leuven RDR repositories. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up?
