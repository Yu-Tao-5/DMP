These areas are the last obstacles to a major breakthrough of FHE in industry. The first challenge pertains to\nefficiency, as the complex and large structure of FHE ciphertexts can result in lengthy execution times and storage management difficulties.\nThe second issue is the usability of FHE. Developing an efficient FHE program necessitates deep knowledge of the field, which can be a\nchallenge for many. To mitigate this issue, various open-source compilers, including HEIR and HECO, have been improved to lower the\nimplementation threshold and make FHE more accessible to a wider audience. However, these compilers do not work with hardware\naccelerators or produce efficient parallelisable software code. \n \nThe final issue with homomorphic encryption is the integrity problem. If we outsource our computations to a cloud service, we have no\nassurance that only the requested operations are executed. Nonetheless, we can address this problem by leveraging verifiable computing (VC)\ntechniques, such as trusted execution environment (TEE) or zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), to ensure trustworthy execution. However, these\ncurrent techniques create too much overhead when applied to a complete FHE program. We aim to develop research solutions to incorporate\nVC into an FHE compiler efficiently without impacting the efficiency. \nIn this proposal, we present a solution to these problems, preparing the Flemish industry to become a precursor of secure computing. \nIn this project, we will investigate how to efficiently use FPGA accelerators and add integrity without introducing too much overhead in an end-to-\nend FHE program.\nID: \nID: \n211355\nStart date: \nStart date: \n01-11-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n31-10-2028\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n29-11-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

All code projects will be accompanied by a readme file describing the software and hardware prerequisites required to (re-)use the code. Additionally, all code will be extensively documented (both at the source code level and at the module level) such that any single part of the code can also be easily re-used.

Data used to produce project results will be stored in a GitHub/GitLab repository. In parallel, we will store the same data in our departemental home directories, hosted by a server at our research department. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? We replicate the data sets among at least two department computers. The GitLab repositories are hosted by a server at our research department and get a daily backup. GitHub is a well-established, commercial repository service provider, which we assume has industry- standard data availability measures in place (such that repositories will not be lost unless deleted by authorized GitHub users).

Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes There is sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project. We have many Terabytes of storage space available on the department machines we use to replicate our data sets. The department's Gitlab instance and GitHub are offered services and are thus ensured to have enough spare capacity. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Access to our department machines is managed by access to the university network and standard-practice user permissions on the machine (only users with the right set of permissions can access the data, our department controls the management of these users). The GitLab repository has access control and is maintained by DMP officer who keeps the structure of the repository in place and manages the access control. Unauthorized GitHub modifications are prevented through their industry-standard user management. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The costs of the gitlab maintenance are covered by our research group. These costs are integrated into the general IT costs. The use of GitHub is free of charge. 4.

Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? To the extent feasible in terms of the volume of collected data, the data will be stored in the Gitlab and GitHub repositories. If we consider it necessary to purchase archival storage capacity for the entirety of the research project's artifacts (e.g., due to non- reproducibility of some data sets and limitations on the Gitlab and GitHub services), we will do so appropriately and in time before the project concludes. Options include the storage services offered by KU Leuven or dedicated storage hardware to be kept long-term at our department.
