However, unlike other national or international legal systems, EU\nfundamental rights do not bind the Member States in all situations. A link to EU law must be demonstrated in order to be able to invoke\nthese rights before the Court of Justice of the EU. The conditions under which a situation is sufficiently covered by EU law are still\nunclear. The CJEU is continuing to shape its jurisprudence on the definition of the scope of EU law that is relevant to trigger fundamental\nrights. At the same time,\nthe EU is changing its modes of policy-making and increasingly uses forms of legal acts that diverge from ‘traditional’ legal acts of\nprimary and secondary law, such as EU funding, advanced forms of cooperation and atypical international agreements. My research aims\nto analyse what is currently covered by the notion of scope of EU fundamental rights according to the CJEU and whether this scope\nshould be extended to new situations arising from the diversification of EU law sources.\nLast modified: \n28-04-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
