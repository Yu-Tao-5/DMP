The bladder wall plays a dual role in this cyclic\nprocess: (1) cells in the bladder wall detect sensory information regarding the filling state of the bladder, and convey this information locally and to the\ncentral nervous system; and (2) the contractile state of the smooth muscle layer dictates whether the bladder accommodates more urine or forces urine\nexpulsion. Dysregulation of these processes lead to lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTd), as in urinary incontinence or urgency.  LUTd affects about\none in five adults, is difficult to treat, and has a strongly negative impact on health and wellbeing.\nWe have recently developed a set of innovative assays to image bladder function in awake mice and to, monitor (sub)cellular calcium signals in the\nintact bladder wall. In this project, we will exploit these assays in combination with precise, light-induced (\"optogenetic\") cell stimulation,  to elucidate\nhow cellular signals that originate in the bladder wall impact on bladder function. We expect that comparison of these processes in healthy versus\ndiseased mice will provide fundamental new insights, which may  form the basis of new treatments for LUTd patients. Finally, the translatability of the\nresults obtained in mice will be assessed using  functional measurements using bladder biopsies from patients. \nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n30-06-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
