Polyamines can also be taken up and,\nrecently, the hosting lab characterized two key members of the polyamine transport system (PTS): ATP13A2 and ATP13A3. Although they represent\npossible therapeutic targets, their relative involvement in cancer is unclear, and based on their distinct endosomal localization they may exert distinct\nfunctions. Melanoma progression is marked by gradual differences in the PTS with a shift from ATP13A2 to ATP13A3, making it a perfect model to\nstudy the relative role of ATP13A2 to ATP13A3. We will focus on a process called \"phenotype switching\" that is associated with the acquisition of\nresistance to current therapy. By modulating expression of ATP13A2 and ATP13A3 in isogenic, therapy sensitive/resistant melanoma cells, we will\ndetermine their relative impact on polyamine levels, proliferation/migration and therapy resistance. Since polyamine and iron homeostasis are\nintimately linked, we will also study the role of ATP13A2 versus ATP13A3 on iron distribution between lysosomes and mitochondria, which may rely\non lysosomal/mitochondrial membrane contact sites. This project will reveal the relative role of ATP13A2 and ATP13A3 in polyamine/iron\nhomeostasis and melanoma progression to define their potential as drug targets in melanoma.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n29-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Electronic lab notebooks (onenote) including the protocols that were used and the eventual deviations from the protocol will be indicated and saved on the J-drive. After departures of lab members, all these files are moved for long-term storage on the K-drive (1TB). Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data?

Yes Relevant information such as the date, type of data, type of biological model used and the experimental conditions will be linked to every raw data file. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 29 April 2024 6 of 9 Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? Data will be stored in personal folders on the lab J-drive (100 Mb) that is accessible for review by the principal investigator and data manager. Data on these directories is automatically backed-up. Large data sets (microscopy) are stored on the L-drive. Once a manuscript is accepted for publication, all original data and summary/report files are grouped and collected at the K-drive of the lab and archived for a minimum of ten years (automated backup in place). How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? Standard back-up is provided by the organisation's IT service (KU Leuven). Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes Large files (such as flow cytometry .fcs and microscopy files) will be stored on a separate large drive (L-drive) which will provide sufficient storage capacity. There is 1TB available currently with the possibility to increase it if needed thanks to the IT service of KU Leuven. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Data stored on personal folders can only be accessed by the researcher or the lab's data manager and principal investigator. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? 503.66 euros/TB/year. Currently the total would be 503.66 euros for the J-drive/year and 2518,3 euros for the L-drive (5TB capacity). These costs are covered by the lab's funds. 4.

Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). institutional policies...). All original data and summary/report files linked to an accepted publication. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Yes, a special repository (the K-drive, 1TB capacity) exist where data will be archived for minimal five years. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? 503.66 euros/TB/year so 503.66 euros per year as the K-drive has currently a 1TB capacity, which can eventually be increased if needed. 5. Data sharing and reuse 5.
