Physical data are all materials that need proper management because they are \nvaluable, difficult to replace and/or ethical issues are associated.  Materials that are not considered data in an RDM context include your own manuscripts, theses and \npresentations; documentation is an integral part of your datasets and should described under documentation/metadata.  \nRDM Guidance on data  \nIf you reuse existing data, please specify the \nsource, preferably by using a persistent \nidentifier (e.g. DOI, Handle, URL etc.) per \ndataset or data type.  Not applicable\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 6Are there any ethical issues concerning the \ncreation and/or use of the data  \n(e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual \nuse)? If so, refer to specific datasets or data \ntypes when appropriate and provide the \nrelevant ethical approval number.☐ Yes, human subject data; provide SMEC or EC approval number:  \n☐ Yes, animal data; provide ECD reference number:  \n☐ Yes, dual use; provide approval number:  \n☒ No\nAdditional information:\nWill  you process  personal  data4? If  so,  please \nrefer  to  specific  datasets  or  data  types  when  \nappropriate and provide the KU Leuven or UZ  \nLeuven privacy register number (G or S number).☐ Yes (provide PRET G-number or EC S-number below)\n☒ No\nAdditional information:\nDoes your work have potential for commercial \nvalorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-\noffs, commercial exploitation, …)?  \nIf so, please comment per dataset or data type \nwhere appropriate.☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes, please comment:  \nDo existing 3rd party agreements restrict \nexploitation or dissemination of the data you \n(re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements,  \nresearch collaboration agreements)?  \nIf so, please explain to what data they relate and  \nwhat restrictions are in place.☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes, please explain:  \nAre there any other legal issues, such as \nintellectual property rights and ownership, to be  \nmanaged related to the data you (re)use?  \nIf so, please explain to what data they relate and  \nwhich restrictions will be asserted.☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes, please explain:  \n4 See Glossary Flemish Standard Data Management Plan  \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 73.Documentation and Metadata\nClearly describe what approach will be followed  \nto  capture  the  accompanying  information  \nnecessary  to  keep  data  understandable  and  \nusable, for yourself and others, now and in the  \nfuture (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and  \ntypes required, procedures used, Electronic Lab  \nNotebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc.  \nwhere this information is recorded).\nRDM guidance on documentation and metadata .While in use/being processed, computational directories will be labelled and structured with \nsubdirectories in as systematic a way as possible, separating different types of calculations/approaches or \nincluding specifically labelled subdirectories with routinely structured processing for additional steps. \nReadme files are and will be included, listing and clarifying the purpose of each subdirectory.\nHigh throughput calculations will be done in an automatised manner, ensuring (and requiring) a \nsystematic organisation of the corresponding data.\nWhen calculations are fully processed, a minimal* set of crucial raw data will be retained and stored \ntogether by category. Appropriate metadate will be included and where the type or nature of the data \nmight be unclear or is nonstandard, extra clarification will be included.\nResulting data (tables, graphs, figures and the like) will be fully retained, but otherwise stored in a similar \nway as the above.\nNewly developed codes will be made available through github.\n*due to the enormous size of raw data  per set (going from 50 GB for medium systems to 500GB for large \nsystems, and expecting to process over 50 large systems) and the fact that most of it could be recalculated  \nif required, only information required to be able to regenerate the data and crucial/very useful/reusable \npieces of data (final geometries and .cube files for example) will be retained.  \n \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 8Will a metadata standard be used to make it \neasier to find and reuse the data ? \nIf so, please specify which metadata standard \nwill be used. If not, please specify which \nmetadata will be created to make the data \neasier to find and reuse.\nREPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN \nFORMAT, WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES, I.E. \nSTANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS.☐ Yes\n☒ No\nIf yes, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used:  \nIf no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created:  \nMany of the used types of data don’t have a general metadata standard. Readme’s and classification \nbased on software will be used to help clarify the context and the nature of data. Many datafiles also \ncontain small metadata blocks, which will be used appropriately.\nFor coding, metadata will be made available in the form of readme’s, manuals and documenting of the \ncode, adhering to  python PEP-8 standards.\n4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nConsult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide  to \nfind the most suitable storage solution for your data.☐ Shared network drive (J-drive)\n☐ Personal network drive (I-drive)\n☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven)\n☐ Sharepoint online\n☐ Sharepoint on-premis\n☐ Large Volume Storage\n☐ Digital Vault\n☒ Other: Staging directory  stg_00137 on the VSC   (5 TB extra backup of computational data)\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 9How will the data be backed up?\nWHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO \nPREVENT DATA LOSS? Crucial and processed data is stored on KULeuven personal onedrive (and backed up to 2 pc’s). Central \nmaps with ongoing calculations are in a data-drive on the VSC when possible, which also has an reliable \nback-up routine.\nHigh-throughput calculation will be too voluminous to handle in there, so they will have to be performed \nin a non-automatically backed-up staging directory. The crucial data will be backed-up biweekly to the \nKULeuven onedrive.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup \ncapacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup \ncapacities are available, then explain how this \nwill be taken care of.☒ Yes*\n☐ No\nFor crucial and processed data there will be enough capacity.\n For raw data, especially in high-throughput steps there will not be enough space to contain everything, so \nremoval of bulky non-essential data (f.e. MD trajectories of structure generation) will have to be \nperformed when the data is sufficiently processed.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely \nstored and not accessed or modified by \nunauthorized persons?\nCLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, \nNETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND \nFILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND \nTRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. \nGuidance on security for research data  Both on the KULeuven personal drive and on the VSC there are strict authorizations in place so no \nexternal/unauthorized user can access the data.  The used PC’s are also properly protected with \nusername, safe password and appropriate firewall\nEach KULeuven-associated PC requires username and password, which must be changed every year.\nWhat are the expected costs for data storage \nand backup during the research project? How \nwill these costs be covered?The extra storage in stg_00137 is €20/TB /year , calculated on how much is used, so a maximum cost of \n€100/year. The cost is overall minor and will be covered by the bench fee.\n5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 10Which data will be retained for at least five \nyears (or longer, in agreement with other \nretention policies that are applicable) after the \nend of the project? In case some data cannot be  \npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this  \n(e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, \nstorage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\n Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy\n☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with \nmedicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans\n☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain)\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and \ncurated for the long-term)?\nDedicated data repositories  are often the best place \nto preserve your data. Data not suitable for \npreservation in a repository can be stored using a KU  \nLeuven storage solution, consult the  interactive KU \nLeuven storage guide .The data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for at least \n10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.\n☒ KU Leuven RDR\n☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes)\n☐ Shared network drive (J-drive)\n☐ Other (specifiy):\nWhat are the expected costs for data \npreservation during the expected retention \nperiod? How will these costs be covered?The data will be stored on the university's central servers for at least 10 years for free. Extra generated \ncosts will be afforded by the research group.\n6. Data Sharing and Reuse\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP)  - Version KU Leuven 11Will the data (or part of the data) be made \navailable for reuse after/during the project?  \nPlease explain per dataset or data type which \ndata will be made available.  \nNOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE \nDATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS \nAND USE MAY APPLY.

Readme’s and classification based on software will be used to help clarify the context and the nature of data. Many datafiles also contain small metadata blocks, which will be used appropriately. For coding, metadata will be made available in the form of readme’s, manuals and documenting of the code, adhering to python PEP-8 standards. 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data.☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Personal network drive (I-drive) ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint online ☐ Sharepoint on-premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☒ Other: Staging directory stg_00137 on the VSC (5 TB extra backup of computational data) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? Crucial and processed data is stored on KULeuven personal onedrive (and backed up to 2 pc’s). Central maps with ongoing calculations are in a data-drive on the VSC when possible, which also has an reliable back-up routine. High-throughput calculation will be too voluminous to handle in there, so they will have to be performed in a non-automatically backed-up staging directory. The crucial data will be backed-up biweekly to the KULeuven onedrive. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes* ☐ No For crucial and processed data there will be enough capacity. For raw data, especially in high-throughput steps there will not be enough space to contain everything, so removal of bulky non-essential data (f.e. MD trajectories of structure generation) will have to be performed when the data is sufficiently processed. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. Guidance on security for research data Both on the KULeuven personal drive and on the VSC there are strict authorizations in place so no external/unauthorized user can access the data. The used PC’s are also properly protected with username, safe password and appropriate firewall Each KULeuven-associated PC requires username and password, which must be changed every year. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?The extra storage in stg_00137 is €20/TB /year , calculated on how much is used, so a maximum cost of €100/year. The cost is overall minor and will be covered by the bench fee. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Guidance on data preservation☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be kept for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data. Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide .The data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. ☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage ( longterm for large volumes) ☐ Shared network drive (J-drive) ☐ Other (specifiy): What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?The data will be stored on the university's central servers for at least 10 years for free. Extra generated costs will be afforded by the research group. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☒ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☒ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: Developed codes (software) will be made available (through github). Some results will be available through papers and their SI (supporting information). The other data will remain available within our research group and can be provided to third parties if requested (and approved). If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.The full dataset will be transferred to my supervisor and will be stored on the university's central servers. He or the future students could reuse the data with the approval from my PhD supervisor and me. The valuable data will be written into research papers. The paper-related information could be shared upon request by mail. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Other data repository (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Data will be included in the supporting information (SI) of published papers to the extent that is possible. Software will be available through github (links to its location will be included in relevant published papers). The remainder of the data (plus a summary of the other data) will be uploaded through lirias and zenodo. When will the data be made available? ☒ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☐ Other (specify) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. Check the RDR guidance on licences for data and software sources code or consult the License selector tool to help you choose. Data will be uploaded to lirias and Zenodo for the KULeuven community with a CC-BY-NC license. As much as possible data is also published in the SI of papers, where they will follow the standard licensing in that journal. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 13Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes, a PID will be added upon deposit in a data repository ☐ My dataset already has a PID ☒ No Published papers will have a DOI, so the data in the SI alongside it will have it automatically. For the data published in Lirias and zenodo we will follow standard KU Leuven protocol. (if this includes or recommends adding a specific type of PID then we will comply) What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? The data sharing through university server and through github are free. The data shared through publication will be charged a fee, which will be covered by the FWO bench fee. 7.
