Indeed, current treatments, typically surgical tumor removal and radio-/chemotherapy, remain inadequate in a high number of cases,\nfrequently followed by recurrence of the cancer. Indeed, effective therapy of EC represents a high unmet clinical need in the women’s\nhealth domain. We established organoid models from patient-derived EC which closely reproduce the original tumors, thus representing very powerful\npreclinical models. Importantly, organoids are robustly expandable and efficiently amenable to drug discovery and efficacy screens. In our project, we\nwill identify novel and effective drugs to tackle EC by applying an automated high-throughput organoid drug screening platform. Moreover, the\nassociated deep omics analyses will uncover response-predictive biomarkers, direly needed to appropriately stratify EC patients toward optimal\n(personalized) treatment.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n20-12-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Notebooks, README.txt files, codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). - Documentation of the mice: in an excel file the following information will be noted for every mouse: cage number, date of birth, gender, derived from which breeding couple, genotype, sacrifice date, used in which experiment. - Daily lab activities are recorded in detail in the online lab book (OneNote). - For documentation of microscopy images (of organoid cultures) the following information will be noted: date, experimental condition, passage of organoid culture, amount of days in culture, magnification used. Images will be saved on the shared drive of the lab and KU Leuven OneDrive in a designated folder of the particular experiment. Within the experiment folder, additional folders are labeled in a clearly structured way (according to different experimental conditions or different timepoints within the experiment). The setup of an experiment is written down in the lab book. A meta data file, generated by the microscope program, is saved automatically together with the image. - For RNA and cDNA concentration and quality measurements using Nanodrop: 260/230 and 260/280 ratios (quality measure) and concentrations are written down in lab book and later transferred manually to an excel file where all previous RNA/cDNA measurements are stored. Date of measurement together with name of the sample is included. - For qPCR data: excel file containing sample setup, raw data, results, melt curve data are given the name: \"date, qPCR_experiment name\". The qPCR data is saved in a \"qPCR folder\" within the folder of the specific experiment, together with the template of the particular qPCR reaction. Name of the template file: \"date, qPCR_experiment name_layout\". Graphs from the data are made using Graphpad Prism (.pzfx file). File is named: \"date, Graphs_expriment name\", and saved in the same folder. - Methodology and protocols for RNA extraction, cDNA preparation, immuno-histochemistry stainings, organoid culture, medium preparation... are all included in the lab book and stored on KU Leuven OneDrive in a designated folder.

No Currently, metadata standards are not implemented in the research group. Metadata are generated during microscopy, RT-qPCR analyses and from sequencing data. In general, to make the data easy to find, a personal folder on the shared drive of the lab and OneDrive is made and is further subdivided a clearly structured way (e.g. specific folders for different experiments).
