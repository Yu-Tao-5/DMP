Global climate change might aggravate issues related to\ndrought stress, and we still lack knowledge on many aspects of plants and ecosystems response\nto drought. Thus, in this project we aim at answering two main research questions: (1) What are\nthe thresholds in the system water content that lead to a decrease in ecosystem's productivity\nand/or leaf area, and an increased flammability risk? (2) How abiotic (e.g., soil) and biotic (e.g.,\nspecies composition) factors influence these thresholds? To answer these questions, we plan to\nuse field data (from the Cerrado biome in central Brazil) combined with state-of-the-art\nmicrowave remote sensing data and time series analysis.\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
