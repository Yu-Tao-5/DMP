As RRIs have a\nnegative socio-economic impact, their prevention is important. Therefore, several RRI-prediction models were previously developed but unfortunately,\nwith limited success. The main reasons for the limited success are the use of a reductionist approach and the fact that a key factor in the development of\nRRIs is missing, namely monitoring of musculoskeletal load (MSL) during running sessions. In this project, I will tackle the identified shortcomings to\npredict and understand the development of RRIs. First, I will develop a wearable solution to measure MSL outside the laboratory by combining\nadvanced biomechanical analyses and AI. Moreover, several MSL-prediction models will be trained for a variety of musculoskeletal structures, for\nmale and female novice runners, and for walking and running. Second, I will use AI in combination with biomechanical knowledge to model data\ncollected during a prospective study to better understand the complex dynamic interactions between risk factors leading to RRIs. I, therefore, aim to\ntrain an RRI prediction model that takes the MSL of the training sessions, the subject characteristics, and the data of a running biomechanics\nassessment into account. Finally, I will use explainable AI models to provide insights into different mechanisms leading up to the development of\nRRIs.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n05-02-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
