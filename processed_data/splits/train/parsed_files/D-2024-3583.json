Yes Additional Information: Archival Research Materials (e.g., Musée de la Bande Dessinée) Copyright applies to many of the comics, manuscripts, and images found in archives. These materials will be used for research and analysis only and will not be reproduced or publicly shared without permission. Proper citation and adherence to fair use or institutional policies will be ensured. Artist Interviews (Transcripts) Interviewees retain rights to their spoken words, but researchers own the transcripts and analytical insights derived from them. Participants will be asked to sign consent forms specifying how their interviews can be used and whether they permit public sharing. Some interviews may be anonymized or shared under a Creative Commons (CC) license if permitted by the interviewees. Workshop Outputs (Student Work at LUCA School of Arts) Students retain ownership of their individual creations, and any use of their work in research publications or exhibitions will require their explicit permission.
