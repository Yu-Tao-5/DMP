Documentation and Metadata\nClearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for\nyourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks,\nREADME.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded).\nThe principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) will be applied.\nAll experimental procedures will be written down in lab books. Each step will wither follow the methodology as described in the applicable standard operating procedure\n(SOP)while deviations from the SOP will be explicitly marked.\nThe project will be placed into a main folder, with subfolders for each work package (WP folder). Within each WP folder will be subfolders according to the task structure\n(Task folder). Any folder below the Task folder level will be named according to following convention: The date followed by a task and an experiment identifier and a short\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Words in the short description field are separated by \"-\"\nEach file will be named accordingly: The date followed by a task and an experiment identifier, a running number,  a short description of the experiment, all divided by\nunderscores: YYYYMMDD_Task1-1_FW001-01_SDS-PAGE-Gel01.\nFiles will be put into a structure where each datatype (e.g raw data) will be placed into its own subfolder below the Task folder level (experiment folder):\nFolder: YYYYMMDD_Task1-1_FW001_SDS-PAGE\nSubfolder\n1) Raw_data\nExperimental data. In case of machine derived data these will include metadata, e.g. mass spectrometry data derived from proteome analysis.\n2) Analysis\nAnalysis scripts will be placed in the \"Analysis folder\", while the output will be placed in a \"Output_R\" subfolder: ./Analysis/Output_R/\nAny software scripts will be placed on GitHub for version control.\n3) Documentation\nHere metadata about the experiments themselves will go in. Examples include pipetting schemes for SDS-PAGE or Protein quantification assays. this includes explanations\nof non-standard abbreviations.\nWill a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which\nmetadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data\neasier to find and reuse.\nYes\nFor Proteomics data the MIAPE standard will be used, also in case of publication, all files will be made available in a format as per HUPO-PSI.\n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nData will be stored at the facilities provided by KU Leuven. Access will be provided via Microsoft Teams.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nBackup data stored in the cloud will be managed by KU Leuven ICTS. In case of non-digital data, e.g. yeast knock-out clones, these will be stored in temperature\nmonitored freezers connected to the emergency power supply. In case the temperature is too high, the system contacts persons responsible for the freezer (e.g. Florian\nWeiland).\n \n \nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nThe total data volume is expected to be around < 5TB. This volume is supported at KU Leuven via Microsoft Teams (max 5TB).\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nMicrosoft Teams supports multifactor authentication as measure against unauthorized access and modification.\nFor non-digital data, e.g. storage of yeast knock-out clones in freezers: Access to the location of these freezers is restricted via a card system.\n \n \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?\nMicorsoft Teams is free for KU Leuven staff.\n4. Data preservation after the end of the research project\nWhich data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the\nproject? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues,\ninstitutional policies...).\nData will be preserved according to KU Leuven guidelines for 10 years, which exceeds the current FWO guidelines of 5 years.\nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nCreated using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 15 June 2023\n4 of 9\nAll data relating to publications will be made public and stored by suitable services. E.g. mass spectrometry raw data and search results will be uploaded to PRIDE.\nAnalysis scripts will be uploaded to Zenodo.\nAll other data will be stored at KU Leuven File Storage.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nPRIDE and Zenodo are free of charge.\nKU Leuven File storage cost approx. 250 Euro/year per TB\n5.

Describe these issues in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. No Will you process personal data? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. No Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. No Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements/ research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. No Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. No 2. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). The principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) will be applied. All experimental procedures will be written down in lab books. Each step will wither follow the methodology as described in the applicable standard operating procedure (SOP)while deviations from the SOP will be explicitly marked. The project will be placed into a main folder, with subfolders for each work package (WP folder). Within each WP folder will be subfolders according to the task structure (Task folder). Any folder below the Task folder level will be named according to following convention: The date followed by a task and an experiment identifier and a short Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 15 June 2023 3 of 9 description of the experiment, all divided by underscores: YYYYMMDD_Task1-1_FW001_SDS-PAGE. Words in the short description field are separated by \"-\" Each file will be named accordingly: The date followed by a task and an experiment identifier, a running number, a short description of the experiment, all divided by underscores: YYYYMMDD_Task1-1_FW001-01_SDS-PAGE-Gel01. Files will be put into a structure where each datatype (e.g raw data) will be placed into its own subfolder below the Task folder level (experiment folder): Folder: YYYYMMDD_Task1-1_FW001_SDS-PAGE Subfolder 1) Raw_data Experimental data. In case of machine derived data these will include metadata, e.g. mass spectrometry data derived from proteome analysis. 2) Analysis Analysis scripts will be placed in the \"Analysis folder\", while the output will be placed in a \"Output_R\" subfolder: ./Analysis/Output_R/ Any software scripts will be placed on GitHub for version control. 3) Documentation Here metadata about the experiments themselves will go in. Examples include pipetting schemes for SDS-PAGE or Protein quantification assays. this includes explanations of non-standard abbreviations. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. Yes For Proteomics data the MIAPE standard will be used, also in case of publication, all files will be made available in a format as per HUPO-PSI. 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Data will be stored at the facilities provided by KU Leuven. Access will be provided via Microsoft Teams. How will the data be backed up? Backup data stored in the cloud will be managed by KU Leuven ICTS. In case of non-digital data, e.g. yeast knock-out clones, these will be stored in temperature monitored freezers connected to the emergency power supply. In case the temperature is too high, the system contacts persons responsible for the freezer (e.g. Florian Weiland). Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes The total data volume is expected to be around < 5TB. This volume is supported at KU Leuven via Microsoft Teams (max 5TB). How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Microsoft Teams supports multifactor authentication as measure against unauthorized access and modification. For non-digital data, e.g. storage of yeast knock-out clones in freezers: Access to the location of these freezers is restricted via a card system. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Micorsoft Teams is free for KU Leuven staff. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). Data will be preserved according to KU Leuven guidelines for 10 years, which exceeds the current FWO guidelines of 5 years. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 15 June 2023 4 of 9 All data relating to publications will be made public and stored by suitable services. E.g. mass spectrometry raw data and search results will be uploaded to PRIDE. Analysis scripts will be uploaded to Zenodo. All other data will be stored at KU Leuven File Storage. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? PRIDE and Zenodo are free of charge. KU Leuven File storage cost approx. 250 Euro/year per TB 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in an Open Access repository All datasets which are not part of publication supplementary datasets and/or deposited at publicly available storage services will be made available on request.
