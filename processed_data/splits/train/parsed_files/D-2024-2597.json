Retrofitting is a cost-effective and non-\ninvasive strategy to make legacy industrial machinery compliant with Industry 4.0 standards by the addition of additional technological features. The\nM-Group at KU Leuven Bruges Campus has created a condition-monitoring methodology using unsupervised anomaly detection with machine\nlearning for retrofitting applications. This resulting model is about 50% smaller than the state of the art, yet as performant in terms of fault detection\naccuracy. This reduced size is an essential advantage when compared to competing approaches, as it enables to perform the actual fault detection on\nMicro-Controller Units (MCU) at the edge. This project aims to develop the Retrokit, a flexible and modular condition monitoring system that\nencapsulates the resulting methodology in an embedded device. As such, it will include generic components for data collection, processing, and\nclassification with a focus on a minimally invasive implementation through analysis of electrical signal data. The objective is to arrive a modular\ndesign that can be connected to fit the specific application. The machine learning models will be designed for multi-scale distributed monitoring,\ncovering various levels of the system being studied, from component to system level. For the hardware-related expertise related to embedded devices,\nM-Group will closely collaborate with the IoT Lab from VIVES University of Applied Sciences.\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n09-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
