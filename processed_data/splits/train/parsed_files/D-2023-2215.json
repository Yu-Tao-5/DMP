Recently, the first \nde novo variants in the TRPM3 gene were identified in individuals wi th developmental and epileptic \nencephalopathy (DEE) characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia and \nabnormal EEG. The p.(V1027M) variant is the most recurrent TRPM3 mutation as it is detected in 15 \nout of 17 patients. Own data indicated the V1027M mutation results in a gain -of-function (GoF) \nmutation of TRPM3. However, the link between TRPM3 activity and the neuronal disease remains \npoorly understood.  \nThe overall goal of this project is to provide novel insights into the role of  TRPM3 in the peripheral and \ncentral nervous system . Here, we aim to (1) characterize the gating properties of newly identified \ndisease associated TRPM3 channel variants, (2) map the expression of TRPM3 during brain \ndevelopment, (3) investigate the impact of the GoF TRPM3 mutation (p.V1027M) in the peripheral and \ncentral nervous system in vivo  using a genetically modified knock -in mice model. Finally, (4) evaluate \nthe potential of TRPM3 antagonists as pharmacological therapy for DEE.  \n1. Data description  \n1.1.

Ethical and legal issues  \n2.1. Will you use personal data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use. Add \nthe reference  to the file in KU Leuven's Record of Processing Activities. Be aware that registeri ng the \nfact that you process  personal data is a legal obligation.  \nNo \n2.2. Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on \nhumans or  animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant ethical \nreview committee(s).  \nAnimals are housed in facilities of the Laboratory Animal Center of KU Leuven, which applies Standard \nOperation Procedures  concerning housing, feeding, health monitoring to assure consistent care in \naccordance with Eur opean and national regulations  and guidelines. Animal administrative, husbandry \nand animal welfare data are sensitive data and are stored in the LAIS  database according to security \nprocedure of KU Leuven. The experiments are covered by ECD  of the KU Leuven.  \n2.3. Does your r esearch possibly result in research data with potential for tech transfer and \nvalorisation? Will IP  restrictions be claimed for the data you created? If so, for what data and which \nrestrictions will be asserted?  \nWe do not exclude that the proposed work cou ld result in research data with potential for tech transfer \nand valorization.  Ownership of the data generated belongs to KU Leuven. If there is substantial \npotential, the invention will be thoroughly  assessed, and in a number of cases the invention will be  IP \nprotected (mostly patent protection or copyright protection). As such  \nthe IP protection does not withhold the research data from being made public. In the case a decision \nis taken to file a patent  application it will be planned so that publications need  not be delayed.  \nHowever, since the project is r ather fundamental, we do not ex pect to achieve data  of high IP valu e.  \n2.4. Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? \nIf so, to  what data do they relate and what restrictions regarding reuse and sharing are in place?  \nNo \n \n3. Documentation and metadata  \n3.1. W hat documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of the data \ncollected/generated in  this project?  \nData will be generated following standardized protocols. Metadata will be documented by the \nresearch and technical staff at  the time of da ta collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the \nelectronic laboratory notebook (E -notebook) and/or in  hard copy lab notebooks that refer to specific \ndatasets. The data will be generated following standardized protocols. Clear and  detailed descri ptions \nof these protocols will be stored in our lab protocol database, and published along with the results.  \n3.2. Will a metadata standard be used? If so, describe in detail which standard will be used. If not, \nstate in detail  which metadata will be creat ed to make the data easy/easier to find and reuse.  \nNo \nMetadata will include the following elements: • Title: free text • Creator: Last name, first name, \norganization • Date and time  reference • Subject: Choice of keywords and classifications • Description: \nText explaining the content of the data set and other  contextual information needed for the correct \ninterpretation of the data, the software(s) (including version number) used to  produce and to read the \ndata, the purpose of the experiment, etc. • Format: D etails of the file format, • Resource Type: data  \nset, image, audio, etc. • Identifier: DOI (when applicable) • Access rights: closed access, embargoed \naccess, restricted access,  open access. Additionally, we will closely monitor MIBBI (Minimum \nInformation for Biological and Biomedical Investigations) for  metadata standards more specific to our \ndata type. For specific datasets, additional metadata will be associated with the data  file as \nappropriate. Give details as needed for the project. Specific examples (adjust as required): - SOPs for \nbiological data  generation are kept on a dedicated KU Leuven shared drive. A central excel file is stored \non that same drive, detailing for  examples: (1) sample ID; (2) SOP with which data generation was \nperformed; (3) abno rmalities or deviations from SOP in data  generation; (4) experimental QC values \n(e.g. DNA concentrations); (5) location of the source sample in the freezer. – For bioinformatics \nprocessing, a data analysis log will be kept that details: (1) sequencing run ID; (2) the bioinformatics  \nSOPs/scripts that were applied; (3) location of source files; (4) abnormalities or deviations. The final \ndataset will be  accompanied by this information under the form of a README.txt document. This file \nwill be located in the to p level directory of  the dataset and will also list the contents of the other files \nand outline the file -naming convention used. This will allow the data  to be understood by other \nmembers of the laboratory and add contextual value to the dataset for future  reuse . \n \n4. Data storage and backup during the project  \n4.1. Where will the data be stored?  \nDigital files will be stored on KU Leuven servers, except for private data that will be stored on KU \nLeuven secure server (digital  vault). Add information about other data types as required (adjust and \nadd more as needed):  \n- Tissue samples: Tissues will be  stored locally in the laboratory.   \n- Vectors: As a general rule at least tw o independently obtained clones will be preserved for each \nvector, both  under the form of purified DNA (in -20°C freezer) and as a bacteria glycerol stock ( -80°C). \nAll published vectors and the  associated sequences will be sent to the non -profit plasmid re pository \nAddgene, which will take care of vector storage and  shipping upon request. - Cell lines: Newly created \nhuman cell lines will be stored locally in the laboratory in liquid nitrogen  storage and will be deposited \nin the UZ Leuven -KU Leuven Biobank. Other human cell lines will be stored locally in liquid  nitrogen \ncryostorage of the laboratory when actively used for experiments. Animal cell lines will be stored in \nliquid nitrogen  cryostorage of the laboratory.  \n- Genetically modified organisms: Mice will b e maintained in facilities of the Laboratory  Animal Center \nof KU Leuven, which applies Standard Operation Procedures concerning housing, feeding, health \nmonitoring to  assure consistent care in accordance with European and national regulations and \nguideline s. All animals will be registered in  the Leuven Animal Information System (LAIS) database, \nalong with corresponding genotyping information, ethical approval  documents and animal provider \nreceipts.  \n- Nucleic acid and protein sequences: All nucleic acid and protein sequences generated during the  \nproject will be stored on KU Leuven servers. Upon publication, all sequences supporting a manuscript \nwill be made publicly  availa ble via repositories such as the GenBank database or the European \nNucleotide Archive (nucleotide sequences from  primers / new genes / new genomes), NCBI Gene \nExpression Omnibus (microarray data / RNA -seq data / CHIPseq data), the  Protein Database (for \nprot ein sequences), the EBI European Genome -phenome Archive (EGA) for personally identifiable  \n(epi)genome and transcriptome sequences  \n4.2. How will the data be backed up?  \nKU Leuven drives are backed -up according to the following scheme: - data stored on the “L -drive” is \nbacked up daily using  snapshot technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous \nversion are kept online; the last 14 backups are  kept. - data stored on the “J -drive” is backed up hourly, \ndaily (every day at midnight) and wee kly (at midnight between  \nSaturday and Sunday); in each case the last 6 backups are kept. - data stored on the digital vault is \nbacked up using snapshot  technology, where all incremental changes in respect of the previous version \nare kept online. As standar d, 10% of the  requested storage is reserved for backups using the following \nbackup regime: an hourly backup (at 8 a.m., 12 p.m., 4 p.m. and  \n8 p.m.), the last 6 of which are kept; a daily backup (every day) at midnight, the last 6 of which are \nkept; and a w eekly backup  (every week) at midnight between Saturday and Sunday, the last 2 of which \nare kept.  \n4.3. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify \nconcisely. If no or  insufficient st orage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will \nbe taken care of.  \nYes There is sufficient storage and back -up capacity on all KU Leuven servers:  \n- The newly initiated mango  (Storage and management of active data  project of the university for esee \n1 TB / research project.  On the active data management platform, researchers can store and manage \ntheir data during the active phase of their research project. The data are stored in ICTS ’ data centres \nin Heverlee and Leuven .  \n4.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup d uring the project? How will these \ncosts be  \ncovered?  \nThe total estimated cost of data storage during the project is 5000€. This estimation is based on the \nfollowing costs:  \n-The costs  of digital data storage are as follows: 35€/TB/Year for the “manGO ” storage.   \n-Maintaining a  mouse colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), excluding the costs of \ngenotyping. When no experiment is  planned with a particular mouse strain, and in compliance with \nthe 3R’s rule (http s://www.nc3rs.org.uk), cryopreservation will  thus be used to safeguard the strain, \nprevent genetic drift, loss of transgene and potential infections or breeding problems.  \nCryopreservation of sperm/embryos costs about 500 to 700 euro per genotype, plus a mi nimal annual \nstorage fee (25 euro per  strain for 250 to 500 embryos). Frozen specimen are kept in two separate \nliquid nitrogen tanks at two different sites on  campus. When necessary, the costs of revitalization from \ncryopreserved sperm/embryos are about 1, 100/600 euro.  Electricity costs for the -80° freezers present \nin the labs are included in general lab costs.  Data storage and backup costs are  included in general lab \ncosts.  \n4.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not a ccessed or \nmodified by  \nunauthorized persons?  \nBoth the “ manGO ” servers of the KU L euven are accessible only by laboratory members, and are \nmirrored in the second ICTS  datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of \nthe data can be  recovered within an hour. Access to  the digital vault is possible only through using a \nKU Leuven user -id and password, and user rights only grant access to the data  in their own vault. \nSensitive data transfer will be performed according to the best practi ces for “Copying data to the \nsecure  environment” defined by KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault is maintained on a \nmonthly basis, including the  application of upgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is \nmanaged by ICTS, and only ICTS  personnel (bound by  the ICT code of conduct for staff) have \nadministrator/root rights. A security service monitors the technical installations  continuously, even \noutside working hours. All private data will be rendered anonymous before processing outside the \ndigital  vault. Only the PI will be granted access to the server to deposit private data.  \n \n5. Data preservation after the end of the project  \n5.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the project? If only \na selection of  the data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is the case (legal or contractual \nrestrictions, physical  preservation issues, ...).  \nThe minimum preservation term of  10 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets. \nAll datasets will be stored  on the university's central servers with automatic back -up procedures for at \nleast 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.  \nThe costs (€ 35 per TB per ye ar for “ mango  extra space ” ) will be covered by the PIs.  \n5.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)?  \nAs a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms \nthat support FAIR data  sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of publication. For all \nother datasets, long term storage will be ensured  as follows:  \n-Digital datasets: files will be stored on the “ manGO -drive”.  \n-Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the lab oratory.  \n5.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How will the costs be \ncovered?  \nThe total estimated cos t of data storage during 10 years after the end of the project is . This estimation \nis based on the  \nfollowing costs:  \n-The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 35€/TB/Year for the “ man GO-drive”  \n-Maintaining a mous e colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), excluding the costs of \ngenotyping. When no  experiment is planned with a particular mouse strain, and in compliance with \nthe 3R’s rule ( https://www.nc3rs.org.uk ), cryopreservation will thus be u sed to safeguard the strain, \nprevent genetic drift, loss of transgene and potential infections or  \nbreeding problems. Cryopreservation of sperm/embryos costs about 500 to 700 euro per genotype, \nplus a minimal annual  storage fee (25 euro per strain for 250 t o 500 embryos). Frozen specimen are \nkept in two separate liquid nitrogen tanks at two  different sites on campus. When necessary, the costs \nof revitalization from cryopreserved sperm/embryos are about 1,100/600  euro. Data storage and \nbackup costs are includ ed in general lab costs .  \n \n6. Data sharing and re -use \n6.1. Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined \nin an  agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions or because of IP potential)?  \nNo \n6.2. Which data will be made available after the end of the project?  \nParticipants to the present project are committed to publish research results to communicate them to \npeers and to a wide  audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be mad e openly \naccessible. Depending on their nature, some data  may be made available prior to publication, either \non an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new  \ncollaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. negative data). We aim at c ommunicating our results in \ntop journals that require  full disclosure upon publication of all included data, either in the main text, \nin supplementary material or in a data repository if  requested by the journal and following deposit \nadvice given by the jo urnal. Depending on the journal, accessibility restrictions  may apply. Biological \nmaterial like genetically modified KI mice will be distributed to other parties if requested  \n6.3. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse?  \nIn a restricted access repository  after con tacting the PI.  \n6.4. When will the data be made available?  \nUpon publication of the research results . Once the data are published they will be available for the \nbroad audience by sharing the link to the dataset.  \n6.5. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions?  \nWhenever possible,  datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through \nrepositories that support  FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain sufficient \ninformation to support data interpretation and reuse, and  will be conform to com munity norms. These \nrepositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative  Commons CC0 1.0 \nUniversal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication, a Creative Commons Attribution (CC -BY) or an ODC \nPublic  Domain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). \nInterested parties will thereby be allowed  to access data directly, and they will give credit to the \nauthors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. For data  shared directly by the PI, a material \ntransfer agreement (and a non disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with  the \nbeneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted  \n6.6. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered ? \nIt is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for \nmetadata collection and  file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free -\nto use data repositories and dissemination facilitie s whenever possible. Data management costs will \nbe covered by the laboratory budget. A budget for publication costs has been  requested in this project . \n \n7. Responsibilities  \n7.1. Who will be responsible for the data documentation & metadata?  \nMetadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and \nanalysis, by taking careful  notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E -notebook) that refer to \nspecific datasets.  The PI  and co -PI will act as the responsible person s.  \n7.2. Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project?  \nThe research and technical staff will ensure data storage and back up, with support from lab technician \nAndrei Segal Stanciu for the electronic  laboratory notebook (ELN) and KU Leuven drives.  \n7.3. Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation  and sharing?  \nThe PI and co -PI are responsible for data preservation and sharing, with support from the research and \ntechnical staff involved in the  project, from  Andrei Segal Stanciu for the electronic laboratory notebook \n(ELN) and KU Leuven drives.  \n7.4. Who bears th e end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP?  \nThe PI and co -PI are  ultimately responsible for all data management during and after data collection, \nincluding implementing and updating  the DMP .

The data are stored in ICTS ’ data centres in Heverlee and Leuven . 4.4. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup d uring the project? How will these costs be covered? The total estimated cost of data storage during the project is 5000€. This estimation is based on the following costs: -The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 35€/TB/Year for the “manGO ” storage. -Maintaining a mouse colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), excluding the costs of genotyping. When no experiment is planned with a particular mouse strain, and in compliance with the 3R’s rule (http s://www.nc3rs.org.uk), cryopreservation will thus be used to safeguard the strain, prevent genetic drift, loss of transgene and potential infections or breeding problems. Cryopreservation of sperm/embryos costs about 500 to 700 euro per genotype, plus a mi nimal annual storage fee (25 euro per strain for 250 to 500 embryos). Frozen specimen are kept in two separate liquid nitrogen tanks at two different sites on campus. When necessary, the costs of revitalization from cryopreserved sperm/embryos are about 1, 100/600 euro. Electricity costs for the -80° freezers present in the labs are included in general lab costs. Data storage and backup costs are included in general lab costs. 4.5. Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not a ccessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Both the “ manGO ” servers of the KU L euven are accessible only by laboratory members, and are mirrored in the second ICTS datacenter for business continuity and disaster recovery so that a copy of the data can be recovered within an hour. Access to the digital vault is possible only through using a KU Leuven user -id and password, and user rights only grant access to the data in their own vault. Sensitive data transfer will be performed according to the best practi ces for “Copying data to the secure environment” defined by KU Leuven. The operating system of the vault is maintained on a monthly basis, including the application of upgrades and security patches. The server in the vault is managed by ICTS, and only ICTS personnel (bound by the ICT code of conduct for staff) have administrator/root rights. A security service monitors the technical installations continuously, even outside working hours. All private data will be rendered anonymous before processing outside the digital vault. Only the PI will be granted access to the server to deposit private data. 5. Data preservation after the end of the project 5.1. Which data will be retained for the expected 10 year period after the end of the project? If only a selection of the data can/will be preserved, clearly state why this is the case (legal or contractual restrictions, physical preservation issues, ...). The minimum preservation term of 10 years after the end of the project will be applied to all datasets. All datasets will be stored on the university's central servers with automatic back -up procedures for at least 10 years, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. The costs (€ 35 per TB per ye ar for “ mango extra space ” ) will be covered by the PIs. 5.2. Where will these data be archived (= stored for the long term)? As a general rule, datasets will be made openly accessible, whenever possible via existing platforms that support FAIR data sharing (www.fairsharing.org), at the latest at the time of publication. For all other datasets, long term storage will be ensured as follows: -Digital datasets: files will be stored on the “ manGO -drive”. -Tissue samples: Tissues will be stored locally in the lab oratory. 5.3. What are the expected costs for data preservation during these 10 years? How will the costs be covered? The total estimated cos t of data storage during 10 years after the end of the project is . This estimation is based on the following costs: -The costs of digital data storage are as follows: 35€/TB/Year for the “ man GO-drive” -Maintaining a mous e colony alive costs about 1,200 euro per year (for 6 cages), excluding the costs of genotyping. When no experiment is planned with a particular mouse strain, and in compliance with the 3R’s rule ( https://www.nc3rs.org.uk ), cryopreservation will thus be u sed to safeguard the strain, prevent genetic drift, loss of transgene and potential infections or breeding problems. Cryopreservation of sperm/embryos costs about 500 to 700 euro per genotype, plus a minimal annual storage fee (25 euro per strain for 250 t o 500 embryos). Frozen specimen are kept in two separate liquid nitrogen tanks at two different sites on campus. When necessary, the costs of revitalization from cryopreserved sperm/embryos are about 1,100/600 euro. Data storage and backup costs are includ ed in general lab costs . 6. Data sharing and re -use 6.1. Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions or because of IP potential)? No 6.2. Which data will be made available after the end of the project? Participants to the present project are committed to publish research results to communicate them to peers and to a wide audience. All research outputs supporting publications will be mad e openly accessible. Depending on their nature, some data may be made available prior to publication, either on an individual basis to interested researchers and/or potential new collaborators, or publicly via repositories (e.g. negative data). We aim at c ommunicating our results in top journals that require full disclosure upon publication of all included data, either in the main text, in supplementary material or in a data repository if requested by the journal and following deposit advice given by the jo urnal. Depending on the journal, accessibility restrictions may apply. Biological material like genetically modified KI mice will be distributed to other parties if requested 6.3. Where/how will the data be made available for reuse? In a restricted access repository after con tacting the PI. 6.4. When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results . Once the data are published they will be available for the broad audience by sharing the link to the dataset. 6.5. Who will be able to access the data and under what conditions? Whenever possible, datasets and the appropriate metadata will be made publicly available through repositories that support FAIR data sharing. As detailed above, metadata will contain sufficient information to support data interpretation and reuse, and will be conform to com munity norms. These repositories clearly describe their conditions of use (typically under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication, a Creative Commons Attribution (CC -BY) or an ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence, with a material transfer agreement when applicable). Interested parties will thereby be allowed to access data directly, and they will give credit to the authors for the data used by citing the corresponding DOI. For data shared directly by the PI, a material transfer agreement (and a non disclosure agreement if applicable) will be concluded with the beneficiaries in order to clearly describe the types of reuse that are permitted 6.6. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered ? It is the intention to minimize data management costs by implementing standard procedures e.g. for metadata collection and file storage and organization from the start of the project, and by using free - to use data repositories and dissemination facilitie s whenever possible. Data management costs will be covered by the laboratory budget. A budget for publication costs has been requested in this project . 7. Responsibilities 7.1. Who will be responsible for the data documentation & metadata? Metadata will be documented by the research and technical staff at the time of data collection and analysis, by taking careful notes in the electronic laboratory notebook (E -notebook) that refer to specific datasets. The PI and co -PI will act as the responsible person s. 7.2. Who will be responsible for data storage & back up during the project? The research and technical staff will ensure data storage and back up, with support from lab technician Andrei Segal Stanciu for the electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) and KU Leuven drives. 7.3. Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and sharing? The PI and co -PI are responsible for data preservation and sharing, with support from the research and technical staff involved in the project, from Andrei Segal Stanciu for the electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) and KU Leuven drives. 7.4. Who bears th e end responsibility for updating & implementing this DMP? The PI and co -PI are ultimately responsible for all data management during and after data collection, including implementing and updating the DMP ."
