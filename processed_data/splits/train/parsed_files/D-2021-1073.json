The\nstatement goes as follows: \"When as a consequence of a morphological change, a\nform undergoes differentiation, the new form takes over its primary ('basic') function,\nthe old form remains only in secondary ('derived') function.\" A famous illustration lies in\nthe English word pair 'brethren-brothers'. The new form 'brothers' took over the primary\nfunction, while the old form 'brethren' lived on taking a specialized function 'fellow\nmembers of a religious order' Yet, so far, the evidence for this law remains mostly\nanecdotal. The assessment of this statement can shed light not only on this interplay\nbetween semantics and language change, but also on broader linguistic phenomena\nas iconicity, isomorphism, exaptation and prototype theory. I will carry out multiple\nquantitative case studies on Dutch, with different time scopes (from Middle Dutch until\nnow). I will tackle 4 research questions. 1) When a doublet arises, does the new form\ninevitably take on the primary function, while the old form remains in the secondary\nfunction? 2) Is K4 limited to morphological cases, or is it a more general principle that\ncan be applied to other domains as well? 3) If cases occur where K4 does not apply,\ncan these cases be grouped under a common denominator and can a general\nexplanation be found? 4) What are the cognitive mechanisms behind K4?\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.
