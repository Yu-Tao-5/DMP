For this purpose, at least three genome-wide CRISPR knock-out screens will\nbe performed in SW26 cells (relying on the ALT pathway) and SW39 cells (relying on telomerase).\nInstitution\n KU Leuven\n1.

These data can be obtained, for\nexample, from the GDC portal (TCGA-SARC database) and the Laboratory of Precision Cancer\nMedicine (Prof. dr. De Smet - KU Leuven). \nThis item will be updated as soon as we expect to reuse existing data.\nThis document was generated by DMPonline (http://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)\n1 of 4\nDo you use personal data (i.e. all data possibly identifying an individual)?\nNo\n2. Documentation and Metadata\nDescribe the documentation that will be created for the data. This section deals with\nthe way in which you will document how the dataset was created and subsequently\nprocessed.\n1. Experimental data:\n Protocol and methodology of each individual experiment will be\ndescribed in a detailed non-digital lab book (chronological). In addition, per larger experiment, a\ndigital folder will be made containing excel, word, and/or PDF files with background info on the\nexperiment, the protocol(s), raw data, (statistical) analysis of the raw data, and an optional graph\nto visualize the results (made in GraphPad or excel). All the files and folders will have a date and\ntitle in their name to easily find back experimental results.\n2. Images:\n Images will be stored in the appropriate digital folder of the experiment during which\nthe images were created (see point 1.). Images for presentations will always be stored in the\nsame folder as the other presentation files (eg. PowerPoint file).\n3. Genomic data:\n Genomic data (fasta/fastq files) will be stored in a (zipped) folder per\nexperiment and will be analyzed with the CRISPRCloud2 script in R-studio. The NGS processed\ndata will be stored in a large excel file (including a 'ReadMe' file) in the same folder. GraphPad\nwill be used to visually represent the data. These GraphPad files and graphs (PDF or jpeg) will\nalso be stored in the same folder.\n4. Cell lines:\n The cells will be stored in liquid nitrogen at the Rega Institute (100*10^6 cells per\ncell line - room 03.A340). An excel file will be updated regularly to keep track of the number of\nvials per cell line.\n5. CRISPRCloud2 script:\n This script will be kept as an R-file. The text function of R-studio will\nbe used to provide information about the different steps in the script.\n6. Lab notes:\n My lab books will be kept in a locked cabinet in my office.\n \n \nDescribe the metadata for the data. This section deals with metadata: information\ncontained in your dataset about the research data.\nThe metadata generated by instruments (Simple WES, TECAN Saffire II, Quantstudio II, etc) will\nbe present in the raw data files, which will be stored in a folder per experiment. These metadata\nconsist of the date/time of read-out and conditions/settings of measurement (specific\nwavelengths, duration of measurement, temperatures, exposure time, etc).\n3. Ethical, Legal and Privacy Issues\nAre there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data?\nPRET questionnaire filled in and accepted (G-2021-4345): There are no ethical issues concerning\nthe creation and/or use of the data for my project.\nDid you consider all issues about copyrights and IPR?\nNot applicable. This topic might be updated in the future.\nAre the collected data considered to be â€œdata containing personal informationâ€​\nand are all the requirements about the collection of these data met?\nPRET questionnaire filled in and accepted (G-2021-4345): I will not collect \"data containing\npersonal information\".\n4. Data storage and Backup during Research\nHow and where will the data be stored during research?\nCentrally on storage facilities of the research unit\nIn a cloud service offered by the university\nThe generated data will be stored on a shared lab drive, provided by KU Leuven.

This shared drive is automatically backed-up by KU Leuven. The data will\nalso be synchronized with my OneDrive profile licensed by KU Leuven, which is only accessible to\nme (password protection). \nWhich back-up procedures are in place?\nThe data will be stored on the research unit servers with automatic daily back-up procedures.\nOneDrive by KU Leuven is also automatically backed-up.\nDescribe the data security procedures and who has access to the data.\nThe data on the KU Leuven lab drives is only accessible for members of our research unit\n(password protection). OneDrive by KU Leuven is only accessible by me (password protection).\n5. Data selection and Preservation after Research\nWhat is the long-term preservation plan for these dataset(s)?\nDuring and after this research project I will be responsible for the correct storage and\npreservation of the generated data. In addition, the head of our research group, Prof. dr.\nDaelemans bears the overall responsibility for long-term data storage. The data will be stored on\nthe research unit shared drives (with automatic backup procedures) for at least 10 years,\nconform the KU Leuven RDM policy. My written lab notes will also be stored in a locked cabinet\nfor at least 10 years after the ending of the project at the Rega Institute.\nData Selection: Which data will have long time value for the research and will be\npreserved?\nAll the datasets described in section 1 will be preserved for at least 10 years, according to the KU\nLeuven RDM policy. \n6. Data Sharing\nAre there any restrictions for sharing the data?\nThere are no restrictions concerning data sharing. Data can be shared when there is a data-\nsharing agreement with me or Prof. Dirk Daelemans.\nIf there are no restrictions, which mechanisms will be in place to assure that the data\nare discoverable, accessible and intelligible?\nDiscoverable:\n All data are identifiable and searchable on the KU Leuven shared servers of our\nresearch unit (to the ones who have access to these servers). All the experiments and data are\nstored in folders with clear titles and dates to easily relocate them.\nAccessible: \nAll the data are accessible when there is given permission by me or Prof. Dirk\nDaelemans to access the lab servers.\nIntelligible:\n All the data are intelligible due to the Read-me files and experiment information\nfiles in the folders per experiment. Moreover, the written lab notes also provide background\ninformation to understand the performed experiments and generated data.\nHow will you share the data?\nPublication\nThe generated data will be published in multiple manuscripts (articles).
