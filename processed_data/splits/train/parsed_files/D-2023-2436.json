The hologenome theory posits that if  \nmicrobiomes are vertically inherited, host and microbiome will co-adapt and could then potentially act as a single  \nunit of selection. To test this theory, our project will use wholegenome shotgun metagenomic microbiome and  \nmitogenome sequencing of solitary and social bees to quantify changes in mode of transmission and degree of  \nphylosymbiosis  of  gut  microbiome  symbionts  across  different  levels  of  sociality.  Subsequently,  microbiome  \ntransplant experiments will be conducted to study the impacts of microbiome variation on host fitness. Finally, the  \nproject will test if intercolony variation in microbiome composition and fitness consequences are transmitted across  \ngenerations and are heritable. Overall, this project will provide a unique test of the hologenome theory of evolution  \nand allow for a better understanding of how hosts and microbiomes co-evolve.\n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created: 4.Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Biological samples will be stored in the laboratory facilities, which are equipped with multiple refrigerators, including a -80°C fridge. Additionally, datasets resulting from the curation of this data will be kept on KU Leuven OneDrive as well as on the lab’s two QNAP NAS systems. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 9How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS? DESCRIBE THE LOCATIONS, STORAGE MEDIA AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL BE USED FOR STORING AND BACKING UP DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL DATA DURING RESEARCH.7 REFER TO INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC POLICIES REGARDING BACKUP PROCEDURES WHEN APPROPRIATE.Our lab is equipped with 2 QNAP NAS (Network Attached Storage) serves as a centralized and secure storage solution, facilitating the storage, backup, and sharing of data across a network. All the data generated will be saved on both servers, to ensure that the data is kept safe and I will perform backups on a weekly basis. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.☒ Yes ☐ No If yes, please specify concisely: Our server, QNAP NAS, currently has over 50 TB of available space, which exceeds the requirements of the current data management plan. \"If no, please specify: How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7Access to the physical storage of the data is restricted solely to authorized personnel. Physical data will be maintained within our laboratory facilities, which requires a badge to access that is only provided to authorized staff. Concerning network facilities and the security of computer systems and files, data will be stored in QNAP NAS systems. These systems employ encryption technology and operate through a secure connection, ensuring the safety of stored data and preventing unauthorized access. 7 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 10What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?Since all data storage systems, including the aforementioned QNAP NAS systems, are already established in the lab, no anticipated costs are foreseen. The same applies to physical data, as the lab is already equipped with the facilities that ensure the storage of the data. 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).The data (both physical data such as biological samples and digital data) will be retained for at least ten years, with the possibility of indefinite retention. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?All data generated in this project, whether physical or digital, will be preserved in the lab facilities. The lab is equipped with several fridges, including a -80°C unit for the physical biological samples, and two servers (QNAP NAS) for the digital data. For the long-term archiving of data, digital repositories will be used to store various types of data, including genomic, raw, and processed data. The selected repositories include NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), Dryad (https://datadryad.org/stash), Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/), and the KU Leuven Research Data Repository (RDR) (https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr). The selected platform for data repository aligns with the established protocol procedures in our lab, which are consistently employed for data storage. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?There are no costs expected.

Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify: Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.As the current data management plan only involves the collection of biological samples, the current question does not apply. However, possible repositories include the KU Leuven Research Data Repository (RDR), Dryad, or alternative platforms based on the specific publishing guidelines of the journal, such as Dryad or Zenodo. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.Data will be made publicly available upon the dissemination/publication of the research findings. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 All data from the project is expected to be accessible, and it will be made available under a Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY 4.0), requiring users to give credit to the original data creators. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here.
