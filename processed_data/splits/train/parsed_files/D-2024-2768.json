As software complexity grows, the number of issues affecting automotive safety-critical processes\ngrows. Overwhelming SEV growth not only opens the door for better user satisfaction, but it also creates a fear of potential data theft and\ncyber-attacks like the Jeep-hack and the Charging station attack. With the increased availability of wireless interfaces and software\nintegration, an attacker can get access to a vehicle's communication network and exploit vulnerabilities in Electronic Control Units\n(ECUs). Vehicle makers have logically separated in-vehicle networks into sub-networks to safeguard important systems against such\nattacks. However, attackers can still physically exploit numerous sub-networks and the CAN-bus. Thus, maintaining the sanity of the\nsystems is an exigent task.

Furthermore, the results of the ML experiments will be\ncontained in the .json format, which is a standardized format for date exchange.\n3. Data storage & back-up during the research project\nWhere will the data be stored?\nDuring the development process, the artifacts produced will be stored on (1) an offline local development copy, (2) a private\nGithub repository, and (3) KU Leuven OneDrive for Business cloud storage. Furthermore, when needed, source code will be\nstored on Gitlab managed by KU Leuven ESAT, enabling efficient version control and sharing with people inside the organisation.\nUpon publication or immediately after the end of the project, the code and results will be made publicly available on Github with\ncorresponding documentation. An additional archive of the Github repository will be created on Zenodo.\nHow will the data be backed up?\nDuring the development, all digital artifacts will be stored on KU Leuven OneDrive for Business cloud storage. This storage option\nprovides version control managed by Microsoft, ensures that the data is stored within Europe, and is additionally backed up by KU\nLeuven. Additionally, source code will be stored on ESAT-Gitlab/Github for efficient version control. With daily commits and local\ncheckouts of the repositories, data loss should be limited.\nIs there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely.\nIf no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.\nYes\nFor all the mentioned storage systems, the storage capacity provided by KU Leuven covers the estimated amounts of data.\nHow will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons?\nAll ICT solutions at KU Leuven are subject to the university-wide ICT information security standards. As such, the OneDrive for\nbusiness cloud storage is suited for confidential data. Root access rights to the artifacts will only be given to the PIs and and the\ninvolved PhD fellow. However, other researchers participating in the project might be granted access rights to individual modules,\nas deemed relevant for the research. \nUpon publication or immediately after the end of the project, the Github repositories (protected by Multi-Factor Authentication)\nwith the artifacts and documentation will be open source. The PhD thesis and papers will not require any access control and will\nbe openly available in KU Leuven Lirias. \nWhat are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project?
