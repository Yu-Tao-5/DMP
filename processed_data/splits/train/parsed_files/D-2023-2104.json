If so, please explain to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes, please explain: 3. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable , for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g. in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures u sed, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded ). RDM guidance on documentation and metadata . • For each experiment, a detailed (electronic) logbook will be used (different logbooks for the different experimental setups). These logbooks will contain the date, a brief description of the performed experiment, the parameters used for each measurement, as well as the names of all the saved files. The names of the files will be structured in a comprehensible way: system studied/date/main parameters used. • In addition, data will be stored in a folder per experimental setup, the type of investigated system and the corresponding date. In this way, by tracking the corresponding logbook notes , each file can be easily found on the local computers controlling the setup and on the server of the laboratory. • The analysis files will contain notes describing the analysis procedure and mention which original data files are included. A readme file describing the goal of the experiment and the analysis procedure will be stored in the folder where the data is saved. FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 8 Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data ? If so, please specify which metadata standard will be u sed. If not, please specify which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. REPOSITORIES COULD ASK TO DELIVER METADATA IN A CERTAIN FORMAT , WITH SPECIFIED ONTOLOGIES AND VOCABULARIES , I.E. STANDARD LISTS WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS . ☐ Yes ☒ No If yes , please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata standard will be used : If no, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type ) which metadata will be created: In this research field, there is no formal metadata standard. However, the standardized steps described above will ensure that the data is easy to find and reuse. 4. Data Storage & Back-up during the Research Project Where will the data be stored? Consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide to find the most suitable storage solution for your data. ☒ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☒ Personal network drive (I -drive) that is synchronized with OneDrive -KU Leuven ☒ OneDrive (KU Leuven) ☐ Sharepoint onlin e ☐ Sharepoint on -premis ☐ Large Volume Storage ☐ Digital Vault ☐ Other: How will the data be backed up? WHAT STORAGE AND BACKUP PROCEDURES WILL BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT DATA LOSS ? ☒ Standard back -up provided by KU Leuven ICTS for my storage solution ☒ Personal back -ups I make ( that are synchronized with OneDrive -KU Leuven ) ☐ Other (specify) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 9 Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. ☒ Yes ☐ No If no, please specify : How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY , NETWORK SECURITY , AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE . Guidance on security for research data The data will be systematically trans ferred to the local server, with restricted access (managed by the IT responsible). Only the promotor and involved researchers have access to the shared folders where the data, analysis files , and reports will be stored. Also, credentials are required to l og in to local computers in the laboratories. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The costs are small. The departmental IT plan that is being rolled out will for each researcher cover a basic amount of data storage. Since data volumes in this project are not large, they are expected to fall within the offered amount. 5. Data Preser vation after the end of the Research P roject FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 10 Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved , clearly stat e the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies.. .). Guidance on data preservation ☒ All data will be preserved for 10 years according to KU Leuven RDM policy ☐ All data will be preserved for 25 years according to CTC recommendations for clinical trials with medicinal products for human use and for clinical experiments on humans ☐ Certain data cannot be ke pt for 10 years (explain) Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long -term)? Dedicated data repositories are often the best place to preserve your data . Data not suitable for preservation in a repository can be stored using a KU Leuven storage solution, consult the interactive KU Leuven storage guide . ☐ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Large Volume Storage (longterm for large volumes) ☒ Shared network drive (J -drive) ☒ Other (specifiy): Lab books will be stored in dedicated cabinets in the laboratories. Digital data will be retained in local data storage facilities. Physical samples used will be stored in lab 01. 13. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The cost for data preservation during the retention period are comparable to the cost for storage and backup during the project. The same conditions apply. 6. Data Sharing and Reuse FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 11 Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE ’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE , CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY . AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS . FOR MORE INFORMATION : HTTPS ://WIKI.SURFNET .NL/DISPLAY /STANDARDS /INFO-EU- REPO /#INFOEUREPO -ACCESS RIGHTS ☐ Yes, as open data ☐ Yes, as embargoed data (temporary restriction) ☐ Yes, as restricted data (upon approval, or institutional access only) ☐ No (closed access) ☒ Other, please specify: Depending on each specific research result, we will consider the option to make the data available as open data on RDR or another platform. This particularly makes sense for analyzed data like mass spectra, a nd reaction kinetics data. Data that is not made available as open data, will be made available if requested by the editor or publisher of a scientific journal or upon request of an individual (e.g. a researcher who intends to reproduce an experiment). If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. In a restricted access depository. Upon request and after the agreement of the project's PIs, all data can be made available on an open repository, for example , if requested by the editor or publisher of a scientific journal or via restricted access upon request of an individual (e.g. a researcher who intends to reproduce an experiment). Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (so me of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate. ☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No If yes, please specify : Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. ☒ KU Leuven RDR ☐ Other data repository (specify) ☐ Other (specify) FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) - Version KU Leuven 12 When will the data be made available? ☐ Upon publication of research results ☐ Specific date (specify) ☒ Other (specify) Upon publication of research results and after agreement of the involved PIs (with a possible embargo time no longer than one year after the publication of the research) Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS . IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED , THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED . DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURS ELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT .
