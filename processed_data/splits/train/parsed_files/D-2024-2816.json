Currently, building renovation strategies mainly consider an improvement in energy performance that may omit substantial impacts related to\nthe production-construction phases resulting in a possible overestimation of the potential benefits of the renovation itself and a disregard for the\npossibility of reconstruction. In addition, most current research is often limited to economic and environmental indicators, often neglecting social\naspects. Assessing the potential for renovation or reconstruction can solve these drawbacks by including indicators that encompass the triple bottom\nline of sustainability. Therefore, the goal of this PhD is to develop a holistic framework assessing the potential for renovation or reconstruction of\nsocial housing buildings, including key environmental, economic, and social aspects, tackling four major challenges: (1) identifying the main factors\ninfluencing the decision on renovation versus reconstruction, (2) selecting adequate sustainability indicators, (3) defining an assessment to inform\ndecision-making in the preliminary stages of projects, and (4) demonstrating the implementation of the holistic framework to support decision makers\nin the optimal selection of renovation versus reconstruction.  \nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n15-05-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

In Research Activities - Analysis all personal data are new and collected during the survey. The focus of the data collection here is related to information regarding the buildings and expertise of participants, as the research does not use personal data beyond organization and name to identify survey participants. Additionally, the study utilizes background inventory data extracted from reputable sources such as Ecoinvent and other reliable scientific sources. All reused data is either derived from databases (e.g., sustainability inventory data) or participating stakeholders (e.g, drawings, bill of materials). Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)?

Yes, human subject data To ensure that the research adheres to formal ethical standards, it will undergo evaluation by SMEC to assess its compliance with ethical requirements. Upon submission, the application number and anticipated acceptance will be integrated into the intermediate data management plan. It is worth note that we anticipate no ethical concerns since the only personal data processed pertains to general information about the survey respondents (e.g., name, job title, company, etc.).

Data storage & back-up during the research project 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Where will the data be stored? During the research: OneDrive for Business, offering 2TB storage for both staff and students, facilitates extensive collaboration opportunities within and beyond the confines of KU Leuven. Accessible through web browsers and a multifactor sync application, it presents a viable solution for storing sensitive data, provided appropriate precautions are implemented. After the research: All digitally generated data will be archived for at least 10 years following the conclusion of the study, consistent with KU Leuven's Research Data Management (RDM) policy. Data stored on OneDrive will remain accessible and overseen by my supervisor. Additionally, data generated through open access publications will be made available via the KU Leuven Repository (RDR) after publications are completed. Any confidential personal data will not be included in RDR. How will the data be backed up? How will the data be backed up? OneDrive for Business offers automatic backups, supplemented by periodic backups of crucial files on an external hard drive. Physical data and documentation will be meticulously organized in labeled folders within KU Leuven's office cabinet, with digital copies integrated into relevant dataset folders whenever feasible. The KU Leuven Repository (RDR), utilized upon completion of the research, will be managed by KU Leuven's ICT support and overseen by Professor Chiara Piccardo, my research supervisor.

How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Physical & paper-based data and documentation files will be stored in clearly labeled folders within KU Leuven's office cabinet. If confidential data is physically stored, it will be done so inside a cabinet that is only open by key. The digitalized files will be destroyed soon after its digitalization process. Only the researcher and supervisors involved in the PhD will have access to the data and the password to access it, unless elsewhere specified. A README.txt file will be added to these folders, explaining the Use Agreements of the data. All data no longer needed will be destroyed in a consistent manner. Non-disclosure agreements will be provided if confidential data is manipulated. At KU Leuven, a multifactor authentication app is used to provide additional protection to all types of data.
