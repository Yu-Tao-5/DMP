The FWO expects a \ncompleted DMP no later than 6 months after the official start date  of the project or fellowship. The DMP should not be submitted to FWO but  \nto the research co-ordination office of the host institute; FWO may request the DMP in a random check. \nAt the end of the project, the final version of the DMP  has to be added to the final report of the project; this should be submitted to FWO by \nthe supervisor-spokesperson through FWO’s e-portal. This DMP may of course have been updated since its first version. The DMP is an \nelement in the final evaluation of the project by the relevant expert panel. Both the DMP submitted within the first 6 months after the start \ndate and the final DMP may use this template.\nThe DMP template used by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) corresponds with the Flemish Standard Data Management Plan. This \nFlemish Standard DMP was developed by the Flemish Research Data Network (FRDN) Task Force DMP which comprises representatives of all \nFlemish funders and research institutions. This is a standardized DMP template based on the previous FWO template that contains the core \nrequirements for data management planning. To increase understanding and facilitate completion of the DMP, a standardized glossary of \ndefinitions and abbreviations is available via the following link. \nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 21.General Project Information\nName Grant Holder & ORCID Jan-Willem Verbeke, ORCID ID: 0000-0002-2793-428X\nContributor name(s) (+ ORCID) & roles Prof. Dr. Bernard Tilleman; main supervisor\nProf. Dr. Nicolas Carette; co-supervisor\nProf. Dr. Benoît Kohl, co-supervisor\nProject number1 & title 11B9423N; The duty to cooperate in construction projects\nFunder(s) GrantID2Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)\nAffiliation(s)  KU Leuven \n☐ Universiteit Antwerpen\n☐ Universiteit Gent \n☐ Universiteit Hasselt\n☐ Vrije Universiteit Brussel  \n☐ Other:\nProvide ROR3 identifier when possible:  \n1 “Project number” refers to the institutional project number.

Moreover societal\nrequirements that construction projects must meet are increasingly higher and more ambitious.\nSustainability and ecological challenges require climate-neutral buildings with reusable building\nmaterials. New building standards and practices (e.g. circular construction) make good collaboration\non the construction site an absolute top priority more than ever. Yet there is no conceptual\nframework for collaboration in Belgium. The exact content and legal consequences are unclear.\nMoreover, liability within the construction network is problematic. The contractual relativity principle\nprevents contractual liability towards non-contracting parties. Strict concurrence rules simultaneously\npreclude extra-contractual liability. The intent of this proposed functional and integrated comparative\nresearch (between Belgian, German, Dutch and Swiss law) is to provide a conceptual framework for\nthe duty of cooperation and its enforcement in construction projects. This framework will give plain\nguidance to all actors of what is expected from them (cooperation) and clear answers when things go\nwrong on who can be held liable and to what extent (enforcement).\nFWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 42.Research Data Summary\nList and describe all datasets or research materials that you plan to generate/collect or reuse during your research project.

CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE MEASURES (IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SECURITY, NETWORK SECURITY, AND SECURITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND FILES) THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT STORED AND TRANSFERRED DATA ARE SAFE. 7The network drives and Onedrive-support by the KU Leuven are password protected. No personal data is used. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered?No expected costs 5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).The relevant research data generated will be retained for a period of minimally 10 years after the end of the project (cfr. KU Leuven Research Data Management Policy). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 11Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? -KU Leuven network drives (I-drive and J-drive) -KU Leuven Onedrive-support -KU Leuven K-drive (back-up) What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?No expected costs FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 126. Data Sharing and Reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? Please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. NOTE THAT ‘AVAILABLE’ DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA SET BECOMES OPENLY AVAILABLE, CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS AND USE MAY APPLY. AVAILABILITY IN THIS QUESTION THUS ENTAILS BOTH OPEN & RESTRICTED ACCESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION: HTTPS://WIKI.SURFNET.NL/DISPLAY/STANDARDS/INFO-EU-REPO/#INF OEUREPO-ACCESSRIGHTS ☐ Yes, in an Open Access repository ☒ Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) ☐ No (closed access) ☐ Other, please specify: The doctoral thesis will be made available via LIRIAS in open access. Reused existing data (DS 1,2 and 3) will not be made available, but will be referenced to in the doctoral dissertation according to the V&A reference rules, so other researchers or legal practitioners can consult these existing data themselves. Only the data that is not already available (e.g. unpublished case law) will be attached to the output of the project (the doctoral thesis). If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions.Therefore, I apply the LIRIAS policy of the KU Leuven Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain per dataset or data type where appropriate.☐ Yes, privacy aspects ☐ Yes, intellectual property rights ☐ Yes, ethical aspects ☐ Yes, aspects of dual use ☐ Yes, other ☒ No Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type.-Doctoral dissertation will be available in LIRIAS (institutional repository) -Non-official reused existing data will be available upon request by mail (jan- willem.verbeke@kuleuven.be). FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 13When will the data be made available? THIS COULD BE A SPECIFIC DATE (DD/MM/YYYY) OR AN INDICATION SUCH AS ‘UPON PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS’.Upon publication of research results Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. A DATA USAGE LICENSE INDICATES WHETHER THE DATA CAN BE REUSED OR NOT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. IF NO LICENCE IS GRANTED, THE DATA ARE IN A GREY ZONE AND CANNOT BE LEGALLY REUSED. DO NOTE THAT YOU MAY ONLY RELEASE DATA UNDER A LICENCE CHOSEN BY YOURSELF IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY FALL UNDER ANOTHER LICENCE THAT MIGHT PROHIBIT THAT. EXAMPLE ANSWER: E.G. “DATA FROM THE PROJECT THAT CAN BE SHARED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER A CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE (CC-BY 4.0), SO THAT USERS HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL DATA CREATORS.” 8 NA Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, please provide it here. INDICATE WHETHER YOU INTEND TO ADD A PERSISTENT AND UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RETRIEVE THE DATA.☐ Yes ☒ No If yes: What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? No expected costs 8 Source: Ghent University Generic DMP Evaluation Rubric: https://osf.io/2z5g3/ FWO DMP Template (Flemish Standard DMP) 147.
