However, gender gaps in labor market\noutcomes still persist today. Despite an extensive amount of economic research aimed at identifying the factors underlying these gaps,\ntraditional factors have not been able to capture their full extent. Recent evidence indicates that gender differences in preferences for\nflexible jobs could be a key factor driving the persistent wage gap between men and women. Importantly, further research suggests that\nchildbirth and child-rearing responsibilities play a role in shaping these differences in preferences.\nIn light of the rising prevalence of employees working in flexible jobs, it becomes increasingly important for policy makers to understand\nhow preferences for flexible jobs interact with other work and family-related decisions in shaping gender gaps in labor market outcomes.\nThe aim of my research is to contribute to this understanding. To this end, I start by examining the role of job flexibility in the decision-\nmaking process of couples with children. Next, I turn to quantify how men and women value flexible jobs and investigate how the\npresence of children in the household affects these valuations. Finally, I study the importance of job flexibility and fertility preferences in\ndriving the life-cycle gender wage gap.\nLast modified: \n25-04-2024\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
