I propose to\ninvestigate the role of ECM proteins in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) homeostasis and ALS pathogenesis. To identify new NMJ targets and elucidate what\ncauses early NMJ loss in ALS, we applied spatial transcriptomics to the lower motor circuitry of three ALS rodent models which recapitulate ALS-like\nfeatures. This innovative work combined with further in vivo protein validation identified two ECM proteins as novel NMJ components which are\ndysregulated in a mutant-dependent manner. Furthermore, ECM dysregulation is emerging as a potential feature in ALS patients. With this solid premise, I\nhypothesize that dysfunctional communication between muscles and motor neurons (MNs) is driven, at least in part, by impaired ECM proteins. Thus, I will\n1) characterize the spatial and temporal dysregulation of both ECMs in mice, 2) identify the most susceptible cells to defective\nECMs by modulating their levels in cultured MNs, muscle and both, and 3) provide pre-clinical in vivo test as to whether targeting newly identified ECMs\nrepresents an attractive therapeutic strategy to restore function. Ultimately, validation in human patient material will ascertain the relevance of these novel\ntargets. Altogether, I will combine in vivo models and in vitro innovative cellular systems together with omics approaches and functional assays. If\nsuccessful my work is likely to broadly impact all ALS forms.\nID: \nID: \n212042\nStart date: \nStart date: \n15-10-2024\nEnd date: \nEnd date: \n30-09-2025\nLast modified: \nLast modified: \n08-01-2025\nCreated using DMPonline.be.
