In the last years, there has been\nincreasing interest in the development of new treatment modalities with reduced side effects for difficult-to-cure cancers. One of the most\npromising examples is photothermal therapy (PTT), designed to selectively kill cancerous tissue through localized, light-induced thermal\nstress. The efficiency of this thermal treatment can be drastically increased by using nanomaterials, in particular gold nanoparticles.\nHowever, only few nanomaterial-mediated PTT have reached clinical trials and knowledge concerning the efficiency, mechanism and\ntoxicity of NP-mediated hyperthermia remains limited. Ideal platforms for this kind of studies are multicellular tumor spheroids.\nNevertheless, in these 3D models, nanoparticle internalization and penetration are drastically reduced compared to the 2D cellular\nmonolayer, impeding consistent investigation. Here, we propose an alternative strategy to perform fundamental studies of PTT in\nspheroids by using our innovative silver nanowire-based endoscopy technique. The probe will be modified to locally generate thermal\nablation inside solid tumors. The cell response and the therapeutic efficiency will be carefully monitored. The information obtained thereby\nwill be used for the rational design of next-generation nanomaterials towards cancer photothermal therapies.\nLast modified: \n25-04-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

In case some data cannot be\npreserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...).\nAll data related to this research will be retained for 5 five years after the end of the project. \nWhere will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\nThe data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for at least 5 years after the end of project, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy.\nWhat are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered?\nThe research unit has already invested in short-term and mid-term procuring storage devices and space for data.

As mentioned before the cost of the storage service is covered by the division.  Since I\ndo not know the size of the data I will be generating, I cannot estimate the percentage of the storage size (20 TB, which costs 2088,4 EUR per year ) that I will be using.  \n5.

If none, please explain why.\nData from the project that can be shared will be made available under a creative commons attribution license (cc-by 4.0), so that users have to give credit to the original data creators. \nDo you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section.\nYes\nA DOI will be available through RDR (Research Data Repository), but it is not available yet.\nWhat are the expected costs for data sharing?

If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? The KU Leuven network drives are incorporated within secured KU Leuven environments, are password-protected (including smartphone-based multi-factor identification) and are only accessible by registered collaborating researchers. Only the PI can request access to the network drive. In addition, the data security is ensured by the dedicated service team at the institution, where the KU Leuven university data center has been built and operated at a very high security level with self-mirrored automatic backup at different physical locations. All data is transfered via encrypted methods. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? The large volume storage price is 104,42 EUR /TB/year. Our division (Molecular Imaging and Photonics) purchases 20 TB / year so the cost will be 2088,4 EUR per year and it is covered by the research fund of division (mainly from Prof. Johan Hofkens).

Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). All data related to this research will be retained for 5 five years after the end of the project. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? The data will be stored on the university's central servers (with automatic back-up procedures) for at least 5 years after the end of project, conform the KU Leuven RDM policy. What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? The research unit has already invested in short-term and mid-term procuring storage devices and space for data. For long-term data storage till 5 years after the end of the project, we will use the service provided by the institution, (Large Volume storage) and data backups stored in external hard drives. As mentioned before the cost of the storage service is covered by the division. Since I do not know the size of the data I will be generating, I cannot estimate the percentage of the storage size (20 TB, which costs 2088,4 EUR per year ) that I will be using. 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in an Open Access repository After the end of project, the data produced in this project will be made usable by third parties via open-access publications and shared depository of relevant data upon requests. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. The access won't be restricted Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. No Not applicable Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. We will deposit the data in our institutional repository, eg. Lirias: https://lirias2.kuleuven.be/default.html When will the data be made available? Upon publication of the research results Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. Data from the project that can be shared will be made available under a creative commons attribution license (cc-by 4.0), so that users have to give credit to the original data creators. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. Yes A DOI will be available through RDR (Research Data Repository), but it is not available yet. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered? RDR is free for KU Leuven personnel, hence, no costs are expected for data sharing. 6. Responsibilities Who will manage data documentation and metadata during the research project? The grant holder, Beatrice Fortuni, will be responsible for documentation, metadata, storage and backup, under supervision of the PI, Hiroshi Uji-i. Who will manage data storage and backup during the research project? Data management, storage and back up will be performed by Beatrice Fortuni, under supervision of the PI (Hiroshi Uji-i).
