This is because educational research aims to develop learning environments\nthat are optimally tailored to accommodate these individual differences in academic learning, such as\narithmetic. Metacognition has been put forward as highly relevant for learning, yet we lack a\nfunctional insight into the role of metacognition in academic learning due to several drawbacks in the\nexistent literature. The current project will tackle these drawbacks by using an experimental\napproach with attention for ecological validity. Therefore, I will introduce a novel methodological\napproach to measure metacognitive monitoring during academic learning in children. Via carefully\ndesigned longitudinal and training studies, I will investigate the association between metacognitive\nmonitoring and the learning of academic skills, such as arithmetic. I will also examine the causality of\nthis association by experimentally manipulating monitoring during academic learning. This integrative\napproach is aimed to generate unique insights into the role of metacognitive monitoring in academic\nlearning that are impossible to derive from the existing literature. This current research project can\nprovide a critical breakthrough in designing effective learning environments in children.\nLast modified: \n29-04-2023\nCreated using DMPonline.be.

Will you process personal data? If so, briefly describe the kind of personal data you will use in the comment section. Please refer to specific datasets or data types when appropriate. Yes Personal data of the participants are name and date-of-birth. These are collected for ID purposes during data collection. It also includes contact information (e.g. email address, name of the school, ...) and signed informed consents. This information is only available to researchers involved in recruitment and data collection (i.e. Elien Bellon, Bert De Smedt). The file linking the code and personal identifiers age/dob is only accessible to these researchers. It is stored in a personal OneDrive folder of Elien Bellon. For the remainder of the project, all derivative data will be coded, and thus pseudonymized, and stored in a different Shared OneDrive folder. Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 29 April 2023 5 of 8 We will follow KU Leuven's GDPR code of using and processing personal data. Furthermore, an ethics application for SMEC will be submitted and registered via the PRET tool. The above applies to all datasets collected in the project. Does your work have potential for commercial valorization (e.g. tech transfer, for example spin-offs, commercial exploitation, …)? If so, please comment per dataset or data type where appropriate. No Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination of the data you (re)use (e.g. Material/Data transfer agreements/ research collaboration agreements)? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and what restrictions are in place. No Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership, to be managed related to the data you (re)use? If so, please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. No 2. Documentation and Metadata Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information necessary to keep data understandable and usable, for yourself and others, now and in the future (e.g., in terms of documentation levels and types required, procedures used, Electronic Lab Notebooks, README.txt files, Codebook.tsv etc. where this information is recorded). For each study, we will make a codebook documenting the study design, sampling, measures and variables that allows a secundary data analyst to use the data accurately and effectively. All tests materials will be made available on the open science framework (OSF) account of the KU Leuven researcher Elien Bellon (https://osf.io/rufxc/) and Bert De Smedt (https://osf.io/cmvdh/). This documentation includes per measure, how it was constructed and how performance indices were calculated. We will pre-register our data-analysis plan on OSF for each study. It will be made available after publication, along with the respective dataset. Will a metadata standard be used to make it easier to find and reuse the data? If so, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata standard will be used. If not, please specify (where appropriate per dataset or data type) which metadata will be created to make the data easier to find and reuse. No 3. Data storage & back-up during the research project Where will the data be stored? Questionnaires, informed consents and paper-and-pencil tasks will be separately archived in a locked room in the office of Elien Bellon. Digital data will be stored in a shared folder on OneDrive. This folder will only be accessible by the KU Leuven researchers (Elien Bellon and Bert De Smedt) working on the project. The KU Leuven OneDrive is password protected. The data will be on the shared OneDrive during the project. After completion of the project all data will be transferred to the OneDrive archive of Bert De Smedt. Pseudonymized data will be made available on OSF when a study is published. How will the data be backed up? The data will be stored on the KU Leuven OneDrive. This data storage location has daily automatic back-up procedures. Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of. Yes The total estimated amount of digital data is 25 GB. The KU Leuven OneDrive for Business (storage capacity 2 TB) has sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project. How will you ensure that the data are securely stored and not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons? Digital data will be stored in a shared OneDrive folder, which can only be accessed by the involved KU Leuven researchers. The data will be pseudonymized by removing personal data and by storing this data separately from the research data on the personal OneDrive of Elien Bellon and Bert De Smedt. Multi-factor authentication is activated for the KU Leuven login of all researchers having access to the data. What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the research project? How will these costs be covered? Created using DMPonline.be. Last modiﬁed 29 April 2023 6 of 8 We expect no costs for data storage and backup on the OneDrive for business during the research project. 4. Data preservation after the end of the research project Which data will be retained for at least five years (or longer, in agreement with other retention policies that are applicable) after the end of the project? In case some data cannot be preserved, clearly state the reasons for this (e.g. legal or contractual restrictions, storage/budget issues, institutional policies...). All data will be stored for 10 years in line with the KU Leuven RDM policy. Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)? Offline copies (questionnaires and paper-and-pencil tasks) and informed consents will be separately archived in a locked room for the expected 10 year period after the end of the project. They will be destroyed after the 10 year period. Digital data will be stored in OneDrive folders of Bert De Smedt for at least 10 years. After publication of a study, the pseudonymized dataset that was analysed in that study will be made available on the OSF account of Elien Bellon (https://osf.io/rufxc/) and Bert De Smedt (https://osf.io/cmvdh/). What are the expected costs for data preservation during the expected retention period? How will these costs be covered? We expect no costs for data preservation during the expected retention period. 5. Data sharing and reuse Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project? In the comment section please explain per dataset or data type which data will be made available. Yes, in a restricted access repository (after approval, institutional access only, …) The pseudonymized dataset of each study will be uploaded on the OSF account of the KU Leuven researchers Elien Bellon (https://osf.io/rufxc/) and Bert De Smedt (https://osf.io/cmvdh/) in a csv format upon publication of a study. If access is restricted, please specify who will be able to access the data and under what conditions. The pseudonymized dataset of a study will be shared in a csv format on the OSF platform. It will be available to anyone provided that they give appropriate credit. Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data (e.g. as defined in an agreement with a 3rd party, legal restrictions)? Please explain in the comment section per dataset or data type where appropriate. No Where will the data be made available? If already known, please provide a repository per dataset or data type. The pseudonymized dataset of each study will be uploaded on the OSF account of the KU Leuven researchers Elien Bellon (https://osf.io/rufxc/) and Bert De Smedt (https://osf.io/cmvdh/) in a csv format upon publication of a study. When will the data be made available? The pseudonymized dataset of each study will be uploaded on the OSF account of the KU Leuven researchers Elien Bellon (https://osf.io/rufxc/) and Bert De Smedt (https://osf.io/cmvdh/) in a csv format upon publication of a study. Which data usage licenses are you going to provide? If none, please explain why. The pseudonymized dataset of each study will be uploaded on the OSF account of the KU Leuven researchers Elien Bellon (https://osf.io/rufxc/) and Bert De Smedt (https://osf.io/cmvdh/) in a csv format upon publication of a study, under a Creative Commons Attribution license (CC-BY 4.0), so that users have to give credit to the original data creators. Do you intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to your dataset(s)? If already available, you have the option to provide it in the comment section. Yes We intend to add a PID/DOI/accession number to our dataset but this number is not available yet. What are the expected costs for data sharing? How will these costs be covered?
