That is perfectly acceptable. The products of your thinking are your data. I would replace \"The funded project does not involve datasets.\n\" by a reference to the articles containing your results. It makes of course no sense to try to put that in the data table.\n\nAs far as documentation is concerned, it would be better to refer to the articles as containing all necessary documentation.\n\nAs far as metadata are concerned: if the journal uses the Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC), then just mention that as metadata. It’s even a metadata standard.\n\nAs far as sharing and preservation are concerned, I would refer to the journal for preservation and to arXiv and Lirias for sharing. Just keep in mind that uploads in arXiv are only considered as open access by the funders if they are peer reviewed versions of the articles.\n\nIt's also best to answer the questions about responsibilities. You might use a formula such as \"For as far as relevant, Yotam Hendel.\"\n\nWe always advise to answer all questions, be it with \"no\" or \"not relevant\".\n\nBest regards,\n\nMark\r\n\r\n08/04/2024\r\nDear,\n\nIt is common practice among mathematicians to enter the articles containing the proofs of theorems and other products of their thinking as data in the data summary.
