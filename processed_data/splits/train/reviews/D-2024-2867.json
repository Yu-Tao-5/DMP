In this case you can't use a license but you need a data transfer agreement, LRD can help you with that (once you have your data (almost) ready) \nQuality: you can add here how you check te quality of your data, eg by determining transcription rules, proofreading or checking the length of the transcription etc you can find some examples here: https://dmeg.cessda.eu/Data-Management-Expert-Guide/3.-Process/Data-entry-and-integrity and here: https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/format-your-data/quality/\nResources: You already mention that RDR is free, you don't have to mention OA publications (the terminology in the questions is sometimes confusing) \nNote that storing data on hard drives is risky, in RDR your data is already preserved, you may not need another copy, but for other data best to have a look in the storage guide: https://icts.kuleuven.be/storagewijzer/en",
