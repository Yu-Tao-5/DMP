Please note that these also fall under the scope of the biobank which means the use has to be registered by submitting a short form. If your group already has this registration please add this under ethics. For more information see: www.kuleuven.be/english/research/associatienet/ethics/guidance/humanmaterial and www.uzleuven.be/nl/ethische-commissie-onderzoek/studie-met-lichaamsmateriaal. \n4.
