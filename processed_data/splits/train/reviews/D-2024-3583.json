  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "14/03/2025\r\n- Data storage and backup: You mention OneDrive as a storage solution for your research data. We no longer recommend OneDrive for this purpose for a number of reasons, chief among which the fact that, because your OneDrive account is connected to your KU Leuven employment, your data is deleted as soon as you leave the university for any reason. In other words, data stored on OneDrive cannot be accessed by the university itself, which goes against KU Leuven RDM Policy. To find a different storage solution, we recommend you use the ICTS Storage Guide (at https://icts.kuleuven.be/storagewijzer/en). Network drives (which you also mention) are a good alternative.\n- Ethical issues: Make sure to submit the PRET application before the data collection phase. We advise you to update the DMP and upload an intermediate version to the Monitoring Tool once you've obtained an approval number.",
