You do however not mention the use of any tools for document management or annotation such as Zotero (https://www.zotero.org) or Tropy (https://tropy.org) that may make data management easier. You can always contact the RDM helpdesk if you have questions about which tools are available and how to use them (rdm@kuleuven.be)",
