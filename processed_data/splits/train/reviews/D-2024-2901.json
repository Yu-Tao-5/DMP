A few remarks to consider when writing the next version of the dmp:\n-\tYou only include new data in your data table, but you mention reused data in the next question “If your reuse data, please specify the source.” Best to add these data to the data table in your next version of the dmp. Are the cell lines and plasmids mentioned in your answer to “Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict exploitation or dissemination etc.” covered in the data table?\n-\tWill you use human cells or other human bodily material? If so please answer yes tot the question whether there are ethical issues and apply for ethical approval, see https://research.kuleuven.be/en/associatienet/ethics/guidance/humanmaterial\n-\tYour answer to the question “Will a metadata standard be used etc.” is more relevant for the preceding question about documentation. If you answer yes, you should mention the name of a metadata standard for your research domain, or refer to a metadata scheme developed and used within your research group. Your might also refer to the metadata generated by your instruments.\n-\tConcerning storage on onedrive, what measures are being taken to avoid loss of data when the researcher leaves the research group?\n-\tIf you are planning to share human genetics/genomics data please note that sharing in GEO is not compliant with the GDPR, instead you can use EGA (https://ega-archive.org/) according to the procedure from the KU Leuven UZ Leuven Data Access committee: https://www.uzleuven.be/nl/dac\n\nMark Verbrugge",
