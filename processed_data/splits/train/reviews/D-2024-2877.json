Two very small remarks:\n-\tBoth Zenodo and RDR will automatically generate a DOI when you upload a dataset so you could answer yes on the question asking whether you use a DOI.\n-\tThe size of the dataset matters, both RDR and Zenodo put limits on the size, but this is often negotiable.\n\nMark Verbrugge",
