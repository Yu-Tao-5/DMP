Please check if this is already registered via your ethical approval (via your supervisor or ec@uzleuven.be), otherwise please update your application and submit a PRET application if needed, for more information see: https://admin.kuleuven.be/privacy/en/studpers/index\nPreservation: Please note that the preservation time for clinical trails is extended to 25 years \nSharing: Your sharing section is a bit confusing, you mention IP as restriction here but no IP issues under the data section and when working with patient data privacy would likely restrict sharing. You also mention a licence (CC-BY), but for restricted data a data transfer agreement is normally needed. Have you also considered using a repository to deposit your datasets under restricted access, this also gives your data a DOI to make it citable and can be done in RDR for example: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr ?
