Data on OneDrive is stored outside of KU Leuven in a Microsoft data center and is linked to your account, if a researcher leaves KU Leuven the account will expire and the data will be deleted making this solution risky. Please consult the storage guide for other solutions and also check what was approved in your PRET: https://icts.kuleuven.be/storagewijzer/en\nSharing: Please ensure that your data is fully anonymized before sharing it as open data on OSF. If the data is pseudonymous, meaning there is still a (small) possibility that participants could be reidentified by you or by others, this is still considered personal data under the GDPR. In this case you can upload your data to RDR via the integration dashboard and apply access restrictions. Interested researchers will be able to view the description of your dataset but must submit a request to access the files. Access can then be granted upon signing a Data Transfer Agreement.
