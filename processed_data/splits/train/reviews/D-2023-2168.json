Could a specific metadata standard be useful, maybe MIAPE (https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.8vv5fc)? For more information see https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/documentation-metadata, ask the core facility where you do the measurements or contact onderzoek2bergen@kuleuven.be if you like to discuss this further\nStorage: Would it be easier to use one secure KU Leuven server with automatic backup? Consult the storage guide to compare different storage solutions recommended by KU Leuven ICTS: https://icts.kuleuven.be/storagewijzer/en\nSharing: You can also consider using a disciplinary repository such as protein data bank (https://www.wwpdb.org/) instead of the generic RDR, for more information see: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/data-sharing",
