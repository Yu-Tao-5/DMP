Ethics: when you are performing clinical experiments you will also collect personal data, make sure to register this when applying for ethical approval via the CTC GDPR questionnaire or, if asked while filling the GDPR questionnaire, a PRET application. See also https://www.uzleuven.be/nl/clinical-trial-center/ctc-gdpr-questionnaire and https://admin.kuleuven.be/privacy/studpers/index\n4.2 Metadata: DICOM is a metadata standard, you can answer yes here. Other metadata standards that you may use are MIFlowCyt (https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.kcnjj2) and CXI (https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.9h5j8c). DDI is used for surveys etc and is probably not very useful for your work. You can always contact onderzoek2bergen@kuleuven.be if you like to learn more about metadata. \n7. Sharing: please note that KU Leuven now has a data repository that you can use for data sharing instead of Zenodo: www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr",
