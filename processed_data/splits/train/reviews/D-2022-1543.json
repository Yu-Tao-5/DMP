Metadata: for microscopy OME is a widely used standard (https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.cq8tg2) and for sequencing MINSEQE (https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.a55z32) please take a look if these could be useful for your work. You can also find standards by reading submission guidelines of repositories, the metadata that GEO/arrayexpress use are based on MINSEQE for example \n7. Sharing: Have you considered using a repository for data preservation and sharing? Bioimage archive (www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive/) or IDR (https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/) for microscopy; arrayexpress (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/) or GEO (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) for sequencing for example? KU Leuven now also has a repository that you can use: www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr",
