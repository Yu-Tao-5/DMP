Onedrive is unsuitable for data preservation and archiving, and I thereforer ask you to look for a different solution. Not only has the storage capacity of One Drive for KU Leuven users been reduced, your KU Leuven OneDrive account is connected to your KU Leuven account. Once you are no longer affiliated with KU Leuven, you and others will lose access to this data. Therefore, OneDrive is not a viable long-term storage or preservation solution. Instead, consider using the shared drive of your research group and protect personal data through access control of the respective files or folders.\n\nYou state that all data will be preserved for 10 years. Please note that, according to GDPR, you are not allowed to retain personal data longer than necessary. This means that some or most of the personal data (depending on what is specified in your informed consent) must be deleted after the project ends. Please consider this!  You also mention that interview data will be made available through KU Leuven RDR. This is an excellent option. Depending on the terms of your informed consent, you may need to anonymize or pseudonymize this data first. Please think more about how you will handle this aspect. Additional information can be found here: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/legal-ethical/personal_data#beforeduringafter \n\nI recommend uploading a new DMP once the PRET application has been approved and include the PRET number. Please incorporate the feedback provided here in the updated DMP.
