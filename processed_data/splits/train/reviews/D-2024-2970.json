  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "22/03/2024\r\nVery good dmp. Just 2 questions:\n- Objective iii in the project descriptions mentions \"embedding the thorium nuclei into specific crystals etc.\" which indicates that physical samples will be produced. Physical samples should also be mentioned in the data summary. They are considered to be data.\n- Sharing data: data will be shared as open data (CC BY 4.0), but the note states that this will be on request to the PI due to the specific nature of the experimental data. I suppose a request will automatically lead to the data being made available to the requester. If not, it would be better to select \"Restricted access\" or \"Other\".\n\nBest regards,\n\nMark Verbrugge",
