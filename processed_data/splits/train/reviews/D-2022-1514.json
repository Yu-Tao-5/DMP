Please note that these also fall under the scope of the biobank which means the use has to be registered by submitting a short form to the UZL ethical committee. If your group already has this registration please add this under ethics. For more information see: www.kuleuven.be/english/research/associatienet/ethics/guidance/humanmaterial and www.uzleuven.be/nl/ethische-commissie-onderzoek/studie-met-lichaamsmateriaal. \n4. Metadata: Other metadata standards that may be interesting for your work are OME (https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.cq8tg2) and MIFlowCyt (https://fairsharing.org/search?q=miflowcyt)\n7. Sharing: You don't have to describe open access publishing in a DMP, this only focuses on data underlying the publications. Are there any domain specific repositories in your field, is IDR suitable for example (https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/), otherwise KU Leuven RDR is a good alternative.",
