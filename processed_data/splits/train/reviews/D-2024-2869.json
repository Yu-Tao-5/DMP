Processed sequenced data 4. Bioinformatic analyses pipeline 5. Phenotypic measurements of Daphnia clones. Not all of them are described in the data table, please add the ones missing (e.g. processed sequenced data, data analysis scipts ect, phenotypic measurements,...)\nAre there physical samples used within this projects (e.g. Daphnia's)? If so, please also describe them as physical data in the table. \n2. Documentation and Metadata: \"3. Processed sequenced data: external harddrives and KU Leuven VSC Tier-1 Data Storage\" Please specify do these add metadata and documentation? \n3/4. Data storage and preservation. Hard drives present many problems for long term archiving (e.g. bitrot, deprecation,...). Do you have a plan in place to ensure the long term readability and usability of the files on these hard drives? How long do you plan to store the data in section 3? You mention 25 years for the publicly shared data. Will it be stored for at least 10 years (KU Leuven RDM policy) on the VSC storage (currently only ensured until 2027)? Have you considered a repository (RDR or alternatives) for these data also, depending on the size? Consult the storage guide for other storage solutions offered by KU Leuven: https://icts.kuleuven.be/storagewijzer/en.\r\n\r\n19/04/2024\r\nResearch Data Summary: When reading the DMP, following categories have been used: 1.
