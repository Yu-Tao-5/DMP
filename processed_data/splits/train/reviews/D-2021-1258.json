You however don't have to list your own presentations and manuscripts in a DMP. \nPlease note that KU Leuven also has a gitlab that may be handy for work: https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/. Data sharing may be easier using a repository such as KU Leuven RDR: www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr or domain specific repositories recommended by the journals where you plan to submit your manuscripts",
