  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "13/02/2025\r\nStorage: you indicate using OneDrive for storage during the project, the ICTS however recommends against the use of OneDrive for research data, and also note that the size has been reduced to 250 GB. Please consult the storage guide for more information and ICTS recommended solutions: https://icts.kuleuven.be/storagewijzer/en\nPreservation: you mentioned that 'field notes and codes' will not be shared due to privacy reasons, the DMP does not specify where this data will be stored to ensure the 10-year preservation period. OneDrive is not suitable for this purpose since OneDrive is tied to your personal account, so after leaving KU Leuven, you will lose the data. Therefore, I advise you to find an alternative solution for long-term storage in the storage guide. \nSharing: Great that you plan to share/publish the pseudonymized data underlying your publications via KU Leuven RDR upon request. However, you can not add a CC-BY license to restricted data, but instead you need to ask the requesting researcher to sign a Data Transfer Agreement, the RDR team together with te legal department will help you with this. As a side note, RDR automatically assigns a DOI to the dataset.",
