For sequencing you can have a look at the ENA checklists to see of any of these may be relevant for your work: www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/checklists\n5. Storage: please answer the first sub question. \n7. Sharing: Have you considered using disciplinary repositories? These make your data more findable and reuable by asking for specific metadata? Would EMBL-EBI (www.ebi.ac.uk/submission/) or IDR (https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/) for example be suitable? If you prefer a generic repository, instead of Zendo you can now also use KU Leuven RDR (https://rdr.kuleuven.be/)",
