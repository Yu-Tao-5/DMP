For more information see: www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/documentation-metadata\nStorage: please clarify where you store your data, are you using onedrive or the servers (I, J, K, L drive) better to avoid the use of exernal hard drives since these are not very secure;  the storage guide helps you to select the most suitable storage solution: https://icts.kuleuven.be/storagewijzer/en\nSharing: Lirias is a publication repository and not suitable for data sharing, KU Leuven has a data repository RDR for that purpose (www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr); but your data may be more suitable for a disciplinary repository, bioimage archive for example (www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive/) for more information see: www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/data-sharing",
