Sharing: have you considered using repositories for data preservation and sharing, maybe disciplinary repositories such as ebrains (https://search.kg.ebrains.eu/), OpenNeuro (https://openneuro.org/) or Neurovault (https://neurovault.org/) may be suitable? You can also use KU Leuven RDR (https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr), here you can restrict access to the datasets in needed, but your data will get a DOI that you can use in your publication, and the metadata that RDR adds makes the data more findable.",
