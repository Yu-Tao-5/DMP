Documentation: Have you discussed tools such as Zotero with Nele, if these are not working for you that is no problem of course but otherwise I recommend to contact her to see if these could be useful. \n5. Storage: KU Leuven also offers a 2TB onedrive which is free for you to use since this is already included in your office 365 subscription paid by KU Leuven. For more information: https://admin.kuleuven.be/icts/english/services/onedrive/index (in my opinion onedrive functions much better than BOX) \n7. Sharing: There is no need to share unpublished work, this question refers to sharing of data underlying publications, for your domain all the information a reader needs is probably already in your paper, but you can take a look in RDR for some examples of data sharing: https://rdr.kuleuven.be/\r\n\r\n23/06/2022\r\nPlease submit a revised version of your DMP as suggested by Nele",
