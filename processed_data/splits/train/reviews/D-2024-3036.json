If you would like to discuss your DMP and/or the feedback I provided, please send me an email: ninotsjka.callens@kuleuven.be\n\n1) Research data summary: please also use the data table provided in the template, organize it by WP and add an estimation of the size of the data. Also specify in the data table which data are digital or physical.\n\n2) Documentation & Metadata: this section is a bit too short. Some tips:\n- In the research data summary you mention creating a database with all the letters and sermons. How will you create this database and how will you make it understandable for others? You will probably also add metadata in this database: e.g. “Title”, “Subject”, “Description”, “Source”, “Creator” etc of each letter/sermon.\n- Will you use a reference manager to organize your literature data like for example Zotero?\n- How will you add structure to your personal notebooks and keep an overview of what information is in which notebook?\n\n3) Data storage during the research project:\n- Where will you safely store your physical notebooks? Will you digitize them?\n- Security: Enable the KU Leuven multifactor authentication for your KU Leuven login\n- Expected costs: as a KUL researcher you can store up to 2 TB for free on KUL OneDrive for Business which will probably be enough.\n- Note that KUL OneDrive for business is a personal storage solution. If you want to collaborate or share the research data you will have to control access manually. See https://admin.kuleuven.be/icts/english/services/onedrive/onedrivesharingfiles\n\n4) Data preservation:\n- Where will you safely archive the database and personal notebooks? Note that KU Leuven OneDrive for Business is a personal storage solution and is linked to your KU Leuven employment and therefore not suitable for archiving research data. For more information on the KU Leuven storage solutions see: https://icts.kuleuven.be/storagewijzer/en\n\n5) Data sharing: Please also give some information on what you plan to do with the database and (digitized) personal notebooks. Maybe it would be really interesting to deposit them in the KU Leuven Research Data Repository (RDR)? Some advantages of RDR:\n- Archive and preserve research data securely on KU Leuven servers (a great solution for the question above)\n- Every KU Leuven researcher can deposit 50 GB per year for free\n- Your published dataset automatically receives a digital object identifier (DOI) to make it easily citable in for example publications\n- Easily link research data to publications in Lirias\n- Open up research data to other researchers and users, legally and in a controlled manner\n- …\nTake a look on RDR and explore datasets from other KU Leuven researchers: https://rdr.kuleuven.be/\nFor more information: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr\r\n\r\n17/06/2024\r\nYou made a good start for your DMP but some sections need a bit more attention.
