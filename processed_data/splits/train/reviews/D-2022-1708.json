  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "04/01/2023\r\nPlease note that FWO asks for EOS projects to include RDM practices for the entire project in the DMP so it can be used as guide/checklist for the different partners to handle, find and reuse the datasets: see www.fwo.be/en/the-fwo/research-policy/data-management-plan \"the DMP should cover the entire EOS project, not only the Flemish part.....\". Please make sure to add this in your final DMP to be submitted as part of the final report via the e-portal of the spokesperson-coordinator at the end of your project; you can upload this updated DMP already in the DMP-MT as intermediate.",
