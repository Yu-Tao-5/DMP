Storage: do you have a specific reason to use dropbox instead of a KU Leuven storage solution? You can find these in the storage guide (https://icts.kuleuven.be/storagewijzer/nl), for example the 2TB onedrive linked to your account that you can use with no extra costs. Please address only the storage that you actually use in the follow up questions. \n6.

Sharing: please note that you can now also use KU Leuven RDR to preserve and share data (for which there is no suitable disciplinary repository) www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr",
