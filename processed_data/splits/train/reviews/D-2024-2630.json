  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "22/04/2024\r\nSharing: pseudonymous data is still personal data under the GDPR which can only be shared under access restrictions, since you are planning to use RDR that is no problem because RDR gives this option, so best to check with the RDR and/or PRET team later in your project when your datasets are ready. When access restrictions are needed you can't select a license but need a data transfer agreement, the RDR team will write this with you and the legal department if needed.",
