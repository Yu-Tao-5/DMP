If you also use patient data please indicate that you will process personal data, and check if this is registered; but since you have a recent ethical approval number this most likely included.

Metadata will also be generated with sequencing, maybe following MINSEQE standard? For more information: www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/documentation-metadata or ask the genomics core which metadata they provide.\nSharing: To ensure compliance with GDRP, please contact the data access committee (dac@uzleuven.be) before sharing any sequencing data",
