  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "13/11/2024\r\nData: Please clarify the data types, you check the box software but from the description it looks more like experimental data \nMetadata: Your instruments may also generate metadata with your measurements, for more information see: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/documentation-metadata \nStorage: Please note that storing data on a HDD is not very secure and that onedrive is linked to the account of one researcher which closes when the researcher leaves risking data loss. You can consult the storage guide to see if there are better solutions, a teams site for example gives access to all researchers without linking it to one researcher's account, see https://icts.kuleuven.be/storagewijzer/en. \nPreservation: Please note that KU Leuven RDR is a repository for data sharing, it will preserve your shared data as well, but can not be used for long term storage only, for more information see https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr\nSharing: Please explain whether you will share your data with researchers outside of your team via a trusted data repository such as KU Leuven RDR, or a disciplinary repository if available, for more information see: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/data-sharing. Peer reviewed journal publications are not in the scope of a DMP",
