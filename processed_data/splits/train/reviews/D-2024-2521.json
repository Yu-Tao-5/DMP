You can therefore indicate \"intellectual property rights\" as a reason for restricted sharing of your research data.\nStoring data on an laptop and external hard drives is usually not considered a good way to archive data. External hard drives have a high risk of loss, theft, or damage to the device, which can lead to data loss. Other storage solutions like the shared network drive are better options for archiving your data. You can check out the storage guide for more guidance: https://icts.kuleuven.be/storagewijzer/en",
