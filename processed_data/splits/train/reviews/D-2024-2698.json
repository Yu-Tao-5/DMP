  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "15/04/2024\r\nPersonal data: The UK and the EU have different rules for when data is considered anonymous; if there is still a way to re-identify the participants, even when you need additional information that stays with your collaborators in the UK, your data is considered pseudonymous and a privacy assessment is needed at KU Leuven via PRET. see https://admin.kuleuven.be/privacy/en/studpers/researchers#section-8, 'Anonymisation / pseudonymisation'. and https://admin.kuleuven.be/privacy/studpers/index\nStorage: storing data on laptops and external hard drives is not very secure, is there a specific reason to use these in addition to a KU Leuven storage solution with automatic backup? see https://icts.kuleuven.be/storagewijzer/en\nSharing: note that, when keeping data under access restrictions, you can't use a license but you need a data transfer agreement that the RDR team will write with you and the legal department when data is requested.",
