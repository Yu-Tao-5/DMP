Our remarks are:\n-\tIt’s good practice to always answer a question, even if the answer is just “No” or “Not applicable”.\n-\tThere is no mention of physical data in the data summary. I would expect physical samples such as mould insertion materials or moulds. I would mention those in the DMP.\n-\tThe column “File format” is empty in the data summary. I suggest to mention the extensions of the files in this column, if known.\n-\tYou mention the use of a metadata standard. Best to say which one. This is not mentioned in the “answer above”.\n-\tIn the answer on “Where will the data be stored?” you mention several different storage solutions. I would specify, in general terms, which solution will be used for which data to put “A TEAMS share point will be created.” in perspective.\n-\tI read the answers on “Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?” as “all data will be under embargo until the patent is filed and after that all data will be shared as restricted data”. If this is not correct, I would add some extra clarifications.\n-\t“Which data usage licenses are you going to provide?”: here I would also specificy whether there will be a licence for data that are not covered by the publicly available patent-online.\n-\tIf you use RDR a DOI will automatically be generated for your dataset, so you can answer yes on “Do you intend to add a persistent identifier (PID) to your dataset(s), e.g. a DOI or accession number?”.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMark Verbrugge\r\n\r\n19/04/2024\r\nDear,\n\nThis DMP covers most aspects well.
