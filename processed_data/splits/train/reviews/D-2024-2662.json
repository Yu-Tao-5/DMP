A few remarks:\n- The way you described your data in the table under Data Summary is as good as it gets for your subject. Well done.\n- Under documentation I wouldn't say too much about where the articles will be stored and kept but rather say a bit more explicitly that no extra documentation is needed because everything you need to know is included in the articles.\n- As all your data is contained in articles you might mention the use of schemes such as the Mathematical Subjects Classificattion.\n- When you mention active use of the data under \"Where will the data be stored?\" you might be a bit more explicit about what active use means, f.e. the preparation of the manuscripts.\nBest regards,\nMark Verbrugge",
