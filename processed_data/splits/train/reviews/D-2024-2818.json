  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "24/05/2024\r\nDear,\nThis is a good dmp with one important issue. On the question “Will you process personal data” you answer “No”. However, this is not consistent with the remark under “Which data will be retained for at least five years ...” that “All data will be anonymized before storage” and the mention of “any restrictions related to personal data ... will be taken into account to determine the preservation.” The answer should be “Yes”.\nA few minor remarks:\n-\tHow will the feedback by the surgeons be collected (data table)?\n-\tIt is not always clear what is meant by “drive”. Maybe best to be more specific.\n-\tWe suggest the paragraph “In each experiment folder, a ReadMe file will be provided that specifies the experiment methodology, used equipment and how to process the data or use/display/interpret the results. All code will contain sufficient commentary for ease of use by non-authors.” under “Will a metadata standard be used?” to the previous question “Clearly describe what approach will be followed to capture the accompanying information etc.”\n\nMark Verbrugge",
