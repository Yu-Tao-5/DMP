Since you write that you still have to recruit a postdoc to work on this project its probably best to make these revisions together with this postdoc who will likely generate and document most of the datasets, please submit your updated DMP as intermediate. \nIf you have any further questions, feel free to contact the reviewer at onderzoek2bergen@kuleuven.be . We can schedule a meeting to go over the feedback.\nFor example DMPs see: www.kuleuven.be/english/research/associatienet/support/scholcomm/rdm/ku-leuven-example-dmps/example-dmps-from-ku-leuven-researchers",
