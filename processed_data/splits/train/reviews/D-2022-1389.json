The goal of a DMP is to act as a guide/checklist for researchers hired on the project so that they know how to handle the research data. This goal can only be reached if a bit more information is provided on the data and documentation. If this section contains a list of all necessary documentation files, the researchers can use this DMP at the end of the project as a checklist to make sure that the documentation is complete. Please note also that information in this section often goes beyond information provided in a method section. Some suggestion:\n- Experiment program\n- Stimulus set\n- Codebook (if not part of R/Matlab)\n- Data-generating code for simulation\n- Documentation on data-generating code\n- Analysis code\n- Software version and version of used R packages\n\nIf not already in method section:\n- (Link to) preregistration\n- Recruitment strategy & participant inclusion criteria\n- Instructions given to participants\n\nSection 6.1:\n- You might consider to delete the (raw) simulated data if the data can be easily generated again with the data-generating code. This might save storage space but should only be done if the data can be reproduced safely and the data generation itself does not use too much resources.\n\nIn section 7 I would also advise to use RDR, the KU Leuven research data repository, as an alternative to OSF. The biggest advantage of RDR for researchers at PPW is the DOI and the higher findability of the data and research materials thanks to better metadata.
