Metadata: you write that you will closely monitor MIBBI, there are many standards in this collection that may be interesting for your datasets, for example MINSEQE, MIFlowCyt (https://fairsharing.org/3518). For microscopy OME (https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.cq8tg2) is often used and for reporting of animal experiments ARRIVE may be interesting (https://arriveguidelines.org/)\n5. Storage: here you mention private data an newly created human cell lines, if you are actually working with these please apply for privacy and ethical approval and list the approval number(s) under 3.

Sharing: have you already considered which datasets you will share and which open access repositories you will use? EMBL-EBI has many good repositories for example: www.ebi.ac.uk/submission, and for data for which there is no good disciplinary repository you can use KU Leuven RDR: www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr/",
