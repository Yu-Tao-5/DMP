Data: Anything that you use or generate and is difficult to replace in case it may get lost can be considered data, are you making any digital of physical notes, images, drawings, are you writing code etc? \n4. Documentation/ Metadata: How are you organizing, documenting and annotating literature, notes and files, do you use a reference manager like zotero (www.zotero.org/) for example, how do you make sure to find and understand these when you write your thesis? \n5. Please note that onedrive is not the \"university's secure environment for private data\" \nI would recommend to add a bit more detail in your final DMP that FWO asks you to submit at the end of your mandate with the final report, If you like to update your DMP already you can submit this as intermediate. If you like to discuss your DMP in more detail you can always contact onderzoek2bergen@kuleuven.be",
