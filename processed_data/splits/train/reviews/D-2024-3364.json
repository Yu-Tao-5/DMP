Upon your departure from KU Leuven, your OneDrive account will be closed, resulting in the loss of any data stored there. To avoid data loss, ensure that you transfer your data to an alternative storage solution before leaving. You can find solutions recommended by ICTS in the storage guide: https://icts.kuleuven.be/storagewijzer/en\nSharing: Only share your data open if you are sure that it is fully anonymous, if there is still a (small) possibility that the participants could be reidentified please apply access restrictions so interested researchers will have to submit a request to access the files upon signing a Data Transfer Agreement. Please note that a persistent identifier (a DOI) will be added to your datasets when you deposit them in RDR. This identifier allows you to link your dataset in your publications and ensures that your dataset is findable.",
