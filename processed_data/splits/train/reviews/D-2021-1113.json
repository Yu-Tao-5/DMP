Documentation: important documentation for your research is also an inventory/bibliography with attributes for the textual resources that you will collect. How will you organise this? Using EndNote or Zotero? Or a database / tabular file?\nMetadata: consider which metadata will be needed to describe the interviews for the AVG Carhif archive. Possible Dublin Core as standard.\n7.

You can also consider KU Leuven RDR to make interviews available for reuse, if you gain consent to do so: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr",
