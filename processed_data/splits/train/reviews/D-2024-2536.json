A suggestion regarding data sharing:\nData sharing in an RDM context means publishing your data on a trusted data repository like for example the KU Leuven Research Data Repository (https://rdr.kuleuven.be/). The institutional repository helps KU Leuven researchers to publish, share, cite and preserve their data in a findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable way with support from KU Leuven staff. The data are safely preserved on KU Leuven servers, receive a DOI and are automatically linked with Lirias. It is also possible to put pseudonymized data in restricted access. If someone requests access to the data, you can evaluate the request and then a data sharing agreement will be drawn up together with the KU Leuven RDR team and legal team in order to protect the data.
