For rtPCR you can take a look if you find MIQE useful (https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.mxz4jy). Also take a look at the arrive guidelines for reporting of animal experiments since many journals ask to follow these (https://arriveguidelines.org/) \n7. Have you considered using any specific repositories for data sharing? Would IDR (https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/) or EBI (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/submission/) for example be suitable? Alternatively you can the KU Leuven data repository RDR (www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr) where you can also restrict access to files or apply embargo if needed.",
