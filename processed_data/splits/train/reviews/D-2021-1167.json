It is therefore not sufficient if you as a researcher are no longer able to identify the data subject. If data are highly unique, (re)identification might also be possible. If you receive pseudonymised data in the context of secondary use they remain personal data according to the GDPR. All processing and reuse of personal data at KU Leuven needs to undergo a privacy and ethics review. Please have a look at https://admin.kuleuven.be/privacy/en/studpers/researchers#section-8 for the difference between pseudonymized and anonymized data; more information on privacy and ethics review can be found at https://admin.kuleuven.be/privacy/en/studpers/index",
