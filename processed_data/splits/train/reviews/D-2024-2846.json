There is just one thing that might be a bit confusing: your answer to the question “Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?” is “Yes, as open data” but on “Which data usage licenses are you going to provide?” your answer is “Data Transfer Agreement (restricted data)”. I would suggest to clarify which data will be restricted. I suppose this should be the data linked to an eventual patent application.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMark Verbrugge",
