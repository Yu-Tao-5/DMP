Or will they be collected during your research? \nIn section 4 you also mention muscle and blood samples, so also include them in the list and indicate where they come from.\nSo your data list will contain both digital and physical data. \n7. Better is to deposit your data in a data repository, rather than to make them available upon request by mail. As suggestions for suitable repositories for your kind of data:\n- imaging data: https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/bioimaging_data#data-publication-and-archiving\n- biomolecular data: https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/data/elixir-deposition-databases\n- else KU Leuven RDR (research data repository): https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr",
