If you haven’t tried out a reference manager like Zotero (www.zotero.org) yet, we heartily recommend those. They're easy to use, have a lot of handy document organization features, and can save you time when you start writing to publish. If you work with images, Tropy (https://tropy.org) may be useful, Tropy is free and specifically designed to organize and annotate archival images. For qualitative data analysis of primarily textual information (text mining) NVivo may be handy, for more information: https://admin.kuleuven.be/icts/english/research/software/Nvivo/nvivo. If you like to learn more about these tools you can always request a meeting via rdm@kuleuven.be",
