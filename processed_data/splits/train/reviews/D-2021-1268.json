Most repositories give you the option to restrict access to your data files but others can easily find your datasets thanks to the associated metadata and you receive a DOI or accession number to list in your publications which may make collaboration easier. Usually disciplinary repositories (for example openneuro, neurovault, ebrains, GIN) are a good place to share but also to preserve your data, and you can also use the KU Leuven repository RDR (www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr)",
