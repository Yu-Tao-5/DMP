Data: Anything that you use or generate and is difficult to replace in case it may get lost can be considered data, what are your proofs and how do you document these? Are you making any digital of physical notes, images, drawings etc?\n4. Documentation/ Metadata: How are you organizing, documenting and annotating literature and proofs? Do you use a reference manager like zotero (www.zotero.org/), how do you make sure to find and understand these when you write your manuscripts or thesis?\n7. Are your proofs part of the manuscript or will you share those separately in a data repository? If you like to use a data repository you could use KU Leuven RDR (www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr)",
