It may be good to convert to the correct template now. You can find the HE template here in the EU funding portal amongst the reporting templates: https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/temp-form/report/data-management-plan_he_en.docx\n\nThen a small suggestions on the content:\n2.2: Restricted data such interview transcripts could also be deposited in the RDR reporsitory, with restricted access.
