You can exclude these by unchecking the respective boxes under the download options.\n- Your Data Management Plan (DMP) currently includes information solely from KU Leuven. The European Commission requires a comprehensive DMP that incorporates information from all project partners. Are you the coordinator for data management for the entire project to be submitted to the EC? If so, please gather the necessary information from all partners. For clarity, it is advisable to begin with a table listing the different partners, which you can reference throughout the DMP.\n- The European Commission requires under Horizon Europe that all data will be be made FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) by depositing it in a trusted data repository, adhering to the principle \"as open as possible, as closed as necessary.\" Examples of trusted repositories include KU Leuven RDR (https://rdr.kuleuven.be/) and Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/). These repositories make your data findable by assigning a Persistent Identifier and metadata, and make it accessible, and help to make data interoperable and reusable. While ManGO is an excellent platform for active research data, it is not a trusted data repository and does not assign a DOI nor ensures that your data is FAIR. Please discuss with your consortium which repositories will be used and update your DMP accordingly.\n- For more information on data sharing and the Horizon Europe requirements see: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/fair and https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/data-sharing and https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/funder",
