Some suggestions:\n1) Research Data summary:\n- \"Are there any other legal issues, such as IP?\": During the experiments you will reuse (real and fake) social media accounts and food messages. Often these (real) posts are protected by copyright. If you plan to re-use fragments of these posts in your publications (in research papers or publication of dataset on OSF) make sure to check the license of the sources and properly cite the sources. More info: https://bib.kuleuven.be/english/research/copyright\n2) Data sharing:\n- Some answers are a bit contradictory. For example, you mention that your data will be made available as open data, but later you rightly mention “Due to privacy reasons we will not share transcripts or audio recordings from focus groups, interviews and roundtable discussions.” Maybe make a more clear distinction of which data you plan to make openly available on OSF (or another repository) with a CC-BY license (which is for openly available data) and which data you will not share or only share on request?\n- Because pseudonymized data are still considered to be personal data, often only anonymized data can be made openly available and pseudonymized data can be shared on request (users need to request access and then a data sharing agreement is drawn up together with the legal department). Ask the PRET team for advice if in doubt whether sharing data violates privacy rights.\n- If you use OSF, choose the Germany - Frankfurt storage location to store the data of your OSF project as this is safer GDPR wise, see https://help.osf.io/article/236-set-a-global-storage-location\n- Consider using the KU Leuven Research Data Repository RDR (rdr.kuleuven.be). Some benefits of using RDR: receive support from KU Leuven staff + the data are preserved on KU Leuven servers + it is automatically linked with Lirias + … It is also possible to put pseudonymized data in restricted access. If someone requests access to the data, you can evaluate the request and then a data sharing agreement will be drawn up together with the KU Leuven RDR team and legal team.
