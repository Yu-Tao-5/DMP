If the data is pseudonymous, meaning there is still a (small) possibility that participants could be reidentified by you or by others, you can use RDR and apply access restrictions. Interested researchers will be able to view the description of your dataset but must submit a request to access the files. Access can then be granted upon signing a Data Transfer Agreement.
