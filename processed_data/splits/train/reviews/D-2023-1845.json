Much better to write “The are no costs.” then to leave the question unanswered\no For example, question 2:\n Documentation: you might repeat that all necessary and existing information is included in the published manuscripts.\n Metadata: you might indicate the source of the keywords, if any, added to the published manuscripts\no For example question 3, about backup, you could just say no backup is needed or possible.\n- 3. Data storage during the project:\no You might mention something about the texts, notes, scribbles, documents, whatever else you create during the creative process and the preparation of the manuscripts, even if they are discarded when the manuscript is published or if they concern ideas that led to a dead end.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMark Verbrugge",
