  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "16/10/2024\r\nGood DMP, some minor suggestions: \nThe GDPR and DPIA pages are not required, you can exclude them by unchecking the corresponding boxes under download \nFindable: The ERC is mainly interested in how you will ensure that your data will be FAIR for external users. Using KU Leuven RDR is great especially for data that need access restrictions, but you can also consider whether disciplinary repositories are more suitable for certain datasets (e.g. https://www.ebi.ac.uk/submission/). You can add here that your data will get a persistent identifier upon deposit in the repository, a DOI for RDR, and that metadata including keywords will be added in the repository. \nInteroperable: Will you use standards or vocabularies, e.g. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)?\nReusable: Will you add a license to your open data (https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr/licenses) or provide a data transfer agreement for restricted datasets, describing how data can be reused? Additionally, you can include details on how you document your data in RDR here, as now described under the ‘Findable’ section.",
