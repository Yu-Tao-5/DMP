I've added a number of comments to the version in attachment.\nMaybe we could organize a meeting, online of live, to discuss your DMP?\n\nBest regards,\n\nMark\n\nmark.verbrugge@kuleuven.be\r\n\r\n05/04/2023\r\nBOF expects a more detailed DMP using the Flemish standard DMP template. You can find this template in DMPonline.be by selecting that there is no funder associated with your project when creating the DMP. Consult https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/funder for more information about the funder requirements, and https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/dmp/dmp for guidance on how to write a DMP",
