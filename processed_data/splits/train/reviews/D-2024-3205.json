See https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content for Zenodo, and https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr/integration-dashboard for an explanation of RDRâ€™s integration dashboard.\n\nFor authors affiliated with KU Leuven: Metadata about any datasets shared/archived on the institutional data repository RDR (https://rdr.kuleuven.be/) will be automatically added to Lirias. When sharing/archiving data using data repositories other than RDR, such as Zenodo, GitHub, and/or DANS,\ndon't forget to add the metadata about the datasets to Lirias (more information: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/faq/faq-rdr#Should%20I%20report%20my%20dataset%20in%20Lirias?).",
