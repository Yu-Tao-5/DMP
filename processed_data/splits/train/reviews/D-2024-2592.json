  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "18/07/2024\r\nGeneral comment:\nThere is quite some information missing from this DMP. Use the following comments to complete your DMP. If you are not sure yet about certain sections, then indicate it like that, but don’t leave anything unanswered. Let us know if you would like to have a short meeting with us so we can guide you through each section of your DMP. You can contact onderzoek2bergen@kuleuven.be.\n\nResearch Data Summary:\n•\tThe first two questions have not been answered. Listing the data that you will create/reuse and relevant information related to each of your datasets (type, format, volume, ...) is crucial for the rest of your DMP. In each section of your DMP you can link the information back to this data summary in order to not forget anything and think of all possible challenges and how to overcome these during your project.\n•\tYou have indicated having any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights and ownership. Please explain in the comment section to what data they relate and which restrictions will be asserted. This also indicates the importance of creating a data summary at the beginning of your DMP.\n\nDocumentation and Metadata:\n•\tIndicate whether or not a metadata standard will be used. Make sure to specify your answer.\n\nData preservation after the end of the research project:\n•\tIndicate where your data will be preserved after the end of the project.\n•\tIndicate the expected cost for data preservation.\n\nData Sharing and Reuse:\n•\tYou have indicated working with both ethically and legally restricted data. This will most likely have an impact on the possibilities of sharing the data. Carefully assess this for each of your datasets and elaborate on the possibilities of sharing for each of your datasets in this section.\n•\tAlso indicate where you might share your data.\n•\tIndicate which license and with DOI of PID you might add to your data.\nAdding a license like CC-BY to a dataset is crucial as it clarifies usage rights, prevents legal disputes, encourages reuse and collaboration, ensures proper attribution, and supports open science principles.\nProviding your data with a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) or PID (Persistent Identifier) is crucial because it ensures the data can be reliably located and accessed over time, enhances citation and tracking of the data, supports data integrity and authenticity, and facilitates better data management and integration into digital libraries and repositories.\n•\tIndicate the expected cost for data preservation.\n\nResponsible:\n•\tCould you clarify what the following means and which arrangements were made: KU Leuven ICTS will appoint a DMP coordinator to support this process, which will include consultation with RDM, ICT and legal experts from the participating faculties to ensure a workable and cost-effective plan. \n•\tThe sentence above is not an answer to the questions asked in this section. Someone related to the project should be the responsible in each of these sections. For each section enter in the name of a specific person related to the project.",
