The current DMP is a blank document with only questions and guidance.\r\n\r\n05/06/2023\r\nThis document only contains the questions asked in a Data Management Plan, and the guidance. I see no actual text that you have written explaining with data your research will generate and how you will manage those. You need to provide an answer to each question in the DMP.\n\nIf you're not sure how to write this, then contact the RDM helpdesk and ask for someone to meet with you to discuss this.",
