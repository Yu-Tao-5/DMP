Sharing: A collection of metadata standards that may be useful for your work are the MIBBI: https://fairsharing.org/3518, for example MINSEQE and MIQE. For microscopy you can consider using OME (https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.cq8tg2). \nAnother place to find metadata standards and guidelines are data repositories. Have you considered which repositories to use for sharing already? Would for example EBI be suitable for your work (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/submission/)? Reading the submission guidelines of candidate repositories may help you to decide the contents of the readme files that you write along with your experiments.\n6. Preservation: Please note that the KU Leuven RDM policy recommends 10 years of storage (www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/policy). The UZL ethics committee even recommends 25 years of data preservation, which is mandatory for data related a clinical trial.",
