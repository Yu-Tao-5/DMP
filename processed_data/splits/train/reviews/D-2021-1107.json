Data: It looks like you will collect many different datasets in many different experiments, it may be easier to show this in a table. \n4. metadata: A collection of metadata standards that may be useful for your work are the MIBBI: https://fairsharing.org/3518, for example MIFlowCyt. For microscopy you can consider using OME (https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.cq8tg2). \n7. Sharing: Have you considered any specific data repositories for sharing, for example IDR (https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/) or maybe EBI (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/submission/)? If no suitable domain specific repository exists you can use KU Leuven RDR (https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr)",
