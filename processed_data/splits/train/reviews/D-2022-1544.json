Metadata: which standards will you use, is metadata generated with your experiments or will you use a repository? For more information: www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/documentation-metadata\n7. Sharing: You don't have to explain open access to peer reviewed publications here, the DMP focuses on the underlying data. Have you considered using a data repository for data sharing? EMBL-EBI (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/submission/) has many good repositories for example and if there is no suitable disciplinary repository you can use KU Leuven RDR (www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr). Reading the submission guidelines of candidate repositories may also help you to decide which metadata to collect along with your experiments.",
