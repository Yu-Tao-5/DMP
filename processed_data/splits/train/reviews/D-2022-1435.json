Sharing: have you considered using repositories for data preservation and sharing, maybe EMBL-EBI repositories may be suitable (www.ebi.ac.uk/submission/)? For data for which there is no good disciplinary repository you can use KU Leuven RDR (https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr). Here you can restrict access to the datasets if needed but your data will get a DOI or accession number that you can use in your publication, and the metadata that repositories add makes the data more findable.",
