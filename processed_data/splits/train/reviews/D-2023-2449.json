Go over the different rows, and state for each if the data will be shared. \nThis also applies to the other questions in this section. \n\"Are there any factors that restrict or prevent the sharing of (some of) the data?\"\nYou mention valorisation potential at the start. Does this also restrict data sharing? \n\"When will the data be made available?\"\nBy definition, keeping the data on the servers cannot be considered as using a repository.\nFor more information on repositories: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/data-sharing",
