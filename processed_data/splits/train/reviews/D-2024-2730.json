Documentation and Metadata\nThe question on documentation asks for information on what the documentation will contain, not where it will be stored. \nPlease adapt your answer to reflect this. \n5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project\nMany cloud based storage solutions (e.g. OneDrive) are based on personal accounts that disappear when a researcher leaves KU Leuven. \nPlease make sure your data will still be present at the end of your project, if you rely on cloud based services. \n6. Data Sharing and Reuse\nPlease specify which data will be shared openly, and which will not. \nAlso, please specify how the data will be shared, and under what licence.",
