It is currently not clear where the research will be performed and/or whether material will be collected abroad and next analyzed at KU Leuven. Please also check whether the use of the plant material may fall under the Nagoya Protocol (https://research.kuleuven.be/en/associatienet/ethics/guidance/nagoya) or local ABS (Access and Benefit Sharing) legislation, in case material would be collected in Madagascar. For questions related to the Nagoya Protocol, please contact Wouter Vandevelde (wouter.vandevelde@kuleuven.be)",
