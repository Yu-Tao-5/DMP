Indicate in your PRET where data are collected (interviews, photographs, video).  In Europe? Outside Europe?. How such personal data are captured, then transferred to KU Leuven storage. Whether or not you keep interview recordings after transcription, etc. It's best to distinguish the storage, preservation and sharing of the raw personal data (handled under GDPR), versus pseudonymised / anonymised data such are your coding. \nGuidance on data management for interviews here: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/rdm-data-types/interview-data",
