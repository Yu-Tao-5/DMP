It makes more sense to list them separately by experiment or type of data: extraction . data, chemical composition, gene expressions etc. (like you did for documentation). That way the DMP becomes a tool to keep track of the different data files you will create.\n7. Data sharing\nDo you know which data repository you might use? KU Leuven has RDR: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr/rdr",
