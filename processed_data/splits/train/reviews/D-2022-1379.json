  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "01/06/2022\r\nSection 2.2:\n- The interviews and the blog texts will probably be coded. The file with these codes is also research data and should best be added to the table in 2.2.\n- According to section 3.1 there are a number of personal data listed that will be collected. These data are not yet part of the research data mentioned in table 2.2 and should also best still be added to this table.\nSection 3.1\n- The health data mentioned in 3.2 should also be in the list of personal data in section 3.1\nSection 5.1\n- The research data contain strictly confidential information (e.g., health data). Therefore data that allows identifying participants (e.g., contact information, raw interview audio files) should be kept separate from the rest of the research data (e.g., pseudonymized interview files). At PPW we provide for this the CODES-shares solution. More information see here:\nhttps://ppw.kuleuven.be/en/research/rdm-at-ppw#data%20storage%20during%20research\nSection 6.1\n- In this section it says that all data will be stored for at least 10 years. As the data contain strictly confidential information, it should be considered to delete data that allow identifying a person already earlier (e.g., contact information, other information listed in 3.1 that could in combination lead to identification of a person. An example of this is occupation + age+ gender + leisure activity).",
