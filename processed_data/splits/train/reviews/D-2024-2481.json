If you are not sure you can use RDR where you can restrict access, you can import your data from OSF using the integration dashboard: www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr/integration-dashboard. When publishing in OSF please register the metadata in LIRIAS so it will appear on your publication list (for RDR this is done automatically) see: https://research.kuleuven.be/en/associatienet/output/lirias/register-datasets-in-lirias",
