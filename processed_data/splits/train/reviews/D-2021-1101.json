  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "12/07/2022\r\n- Please use the appropriate template for your funder (FWO), which you can find via https://dmponline.kuleuven.be.\n- The content of this plan is good overall, so for many questions, you can simply copy-paste the appropriate parts of the text.\n- The DMP template contains a few important questions not yet answered in your text. For example, there are two sections on long-term preservation and data sharing. In other words, how you plan to archive your research data after the end of your project for at least 10 years (the term mandated by KU Leuven) and how you plan to share your research data.\n\nA few tips on these sections: In RDM terms, reliable long-term preservation of data must is best accomplished by using of tools that are specifically designed to store (academic) data for long periods of time. In practice, your best option is to store all data in a data repository, like Zenodo or KU Leuvenâ€™s new repository RDR (https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr). By using a repository, you also kill two birds with one stone, as repositories are also perfect tools for \"data sharing\" in RDM terms. If you're unfamiliar with data repositories, check out the link to RDR or look around in the older repository Zenodo for examples of what others are sharing.",
