In ethnography you will probably work with different types of data besides the transcription files, e.g.: audio recordings of interviews, transcription files of the interviews, observational data: physical and digital field notes, maybe pictures and images taken during fieldwork, and so on. You can organize this based on the fieldwork in the three different locations: Israel-Palestine, Rwanda, US.\n2) Documentation & Metadata: are crucial to make your data findable, understandable and reusable. It will be very important to organize and document your ethnographic fieldwork well, especially since you work with sensitive data, in three different locations. Examples of important documentation & metadata for your research project: a good folder structure, clear file names, methodology information, a codebook explaining the meaning of your codes for the analysis of the interviews, a logbook for your fieldwork, adding structure to your fieldnotes, README files explaining the content of certain folders, ... Will you use a Qualitative Data Analysis software like for example NVivo? You can also mention this here. For more guidance: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/documentation-metadata\n3) Data storage: Important to enable the multifactor authentication (https://admin.kuleuven.be/icts/english/MFA/MFA)\n4) Data preservation: OneDrive is not suitable for long term preservation since it is a personal storage and linked to your KU Leuven employment. You can archive your data on a long term storage infrastructure at KU Leuven (for example an archived folder on the shared drive or a folder on the archival K:drive, for more options consult the storage guide: https://icts.kuleuven.be/storagewijzer/en and/or your local IT team) OR on a trusted data repository like KU Leuven RDR (https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr).\n5) Data sharing: consider sharing the pseudonymized interview transcripts in KU Leuven RDR (rdr.kuleuven.be) in restricted access. Restricted access means that researchers who want access to your data will need to send a motivated request. Once the motivated request is approved a Data Transfer Agreement will be set up protecting your data. For more information: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr/custom-kuleuven\n6) Responsibilities: You will be responsible for day-to-day data management, whilst your supervisor will likely be responsible for overall data management, especially in the long term.\r\n\r\n15/03/2024\r\nYou already made a good start for your DMP but it misses some important information that will need to be added as the research progresses:\n1) Research data summary: the data description table is too short.
