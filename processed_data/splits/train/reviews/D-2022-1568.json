Please also include how your parter(s) manage their part of the data. \nHave you considered using a repository for data preservation and sharing? You can use KU Leuven RDR (www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr) where you have the option to restrict access to the datasets but your data will get a DOI that you can use in your publication, and the metadata that RDR adds makes the data more findable.",
