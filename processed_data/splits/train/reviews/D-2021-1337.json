That means that you will collect personal data, please register this via a PRET approval, see https://admin.kuleuven.be/privacy/en/studpers/index. \n4. Documentation: Have you tried a reference manager like Zotero (https://www.zotero.org)? We heartily recommend those, they're easy to use, have a lot of handy document organization features, and can save you a lot of time of time when you start writing to publish. Most reference managers use the Dublin Core metadata standard which is also used by many databases. \n6. Preservation: Here you can also mention that you will not keep the recordings, are you keeping other personal data such as names or contact information? Are you storing data that is available in the databases that you mention, how long will they be available there? \n7. Sharing:  Please note that publishing of peer reviewed publications in open access does not fall under the scope of a DMP.  For data sharing you can consider KU Leuven RDR (https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr).",
