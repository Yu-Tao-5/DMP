I have just two small remarks:\n\nIn the questionnaire you mention datasets consisting of images but they’re not mentioned in the data summary table. Maybe they’re no longer relevant?\n\nOn the question “Are there any other legal issues, such as intellectual property rights...” you answer no. You might refer to the possibility that patents will be filed.\n\nThere is no need to upload a new version, you can consider the remarks when writing your final dmp.\n\nMark Verbrugge",
