  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "25/04/2024\r\nDocumentation: will you use any documentation software, a reference manager e.g Zotero or analysis tools? see https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/tools\nSharing: Your doctoral dissertation and paper are not considered data but output, RDR is not suitable for this kind of output, but they should be uploaded in LIRIAS. If you have any other data underlying your papers/thesis, you can share this using RDR, eg a bibliography, notes or code, but maybe that is not relevant for your work because everything is in your thesis or papers already, you can decide that later in your project. \n\nIf you like to discuss your DMP and learn more about how RDM and RDM tools can help you with your work, please make an appointment with Nele via the following link: https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/ArtesResearch@KULeuven.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/",
