Just a few suggestions for point 4, \"Re-use\":\n- consider which licence would be suitable for the code you will publish (CC-BY is good for data, but not for code); you can find suitable code licences here: https://ufal.github.io/public-license-selector/ \n- indicate which documentation there would be to facilitate understanding / reuse of data & code, eg ReadMe files, comment lines in code.",
