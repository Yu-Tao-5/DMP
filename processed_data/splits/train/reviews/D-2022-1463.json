Sharing: Have you considered which repositories to use? If there are disciplinary repositories in your field sharing data there increases the findability and impact of your data, but if these are not available you can use the KU Leuven repository RDR: www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr, if needed you can apply access restrictions but others can easily find your data thanks to the metadata and the DIO that RDR assigns and they can request access via RDR.",
