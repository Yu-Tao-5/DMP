Just a few comments:\n1) Data description:\n- potential for commercial valorization: contact lrd@kuleuven.be if you need any legal or Intellectual Property support\n6) Data sharing:\n- Earlier you mentioned that your data has potential for commercial valorization. This can be a factor that restricts the reuse (and thus also the license) of the data that you will deposit on RDR. Keep this in mind when choosing access restrictions and a license and discuss this with LRD.\n- \"File storage at the central KU Leuven datacenters which offer a wide selection of scalable and flexible data solutions at a cost of € 251.83 to € 1,255.66/TB/year, depending on the type chosen. This will be covered within the project funds from Prof. Cassiman.\" I am a bit confused why you mention this here. Every researcher can store 50 GB per year for free on KU Leuven RDR (the insitutional data repository to deposit your data: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr). Maybe you mean the costs associated to the active storing (or the long term archiving) of your research data? If yes, it is best to move this sentence to section 4. data storage or section 5. long term preservation.\n7) Responsibilities:\n- For PhD research projects, the PhD researcher will be responsible for day-to-day data management, whilst the supervisor will likely be responsible for overall data management, especially in the long term. So data storage during the project, documentation and updating the DMP = you , data preservation and sharing = your supervisor.\r\n\r\n26/03/2024\r\nVery detailed DMP!
