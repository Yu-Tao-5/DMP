  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "12/06/2024\r\nClear data table! Some suggestions:\n3) Documentation & metadata: Tropy (https://tropy.org/) can be interesting to organize and annotate the photographs\n4) Data storage during the research project: It is not very clear which data you will store on SharePoint as you previously mentioned storing the data on KUL OneDrive for Business? For your research project KUL OneDrive for business seems sufficient.\n6) Data sharing: You rightly mention what data cannot be made openly available on RDR, but it is not super clear what data you plan to publish on RDR in open access.",
