  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "19/07/2024\r\nGeneral: \nIt seems like you have used an old DMP template. We advise you to use DMP online to write and create your DMP. DMP online will provide you with the correct template and you will get funder-related guidance.\nThere are some differences between both templates but you will be able to copy and paste most of this template into the new one.\n\nData description:\nWith the new template, you can indicate whether any of these data are physical or digital.\n\nData preservation after the FWO project:\nNote that the KU Leuven RDM policy requires you to store all relevant data up to 10 years after the end of the project.\n\nData sharing and reuse:\nThe new DMP template will ask you additional questions on this section make sure to fill them in as well (e.g. Information on licences and persistent identifiers). I see you have indirectly added licence information here as well. You can incorporate that into the new DMP template.",
