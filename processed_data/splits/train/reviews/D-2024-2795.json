Documentation and Metadata\nPlease describe in the second question the metadata that will be created. \nIt can be as simple as metadata automatically generated from instruments (parameters, ect),\nthe information about an experiment in a spreadsheet, \nor the metadata associated with Word and Excel files (right mouse click on a file --> properties - check tab \"details\" for things like author and creation date). \nIf you have any questions on this, don't hesitate to contact us at onderzoek2bergen@kuleuven.be\n5. Data Preservation after the end of the Research Project\n\"Where will these data be archived (stored and curated for the long-term)?\"\nOn which of the Universityâ€™s central service will you store the digital data long term?\nNote that both OneDrive and the Personal network drive (I-drive) are personal storage solutions that disappear if you leave KU Leuven at some point, and thus not considered suitable for long term storage (10 years). \n6. Data Sharing and Reuse\n\"Will the data (or part of the data) be made available for reuse after/during the project?\"\nCan you specify how you plan to publish the data?\nNote that publishing data often refers to data publications in data journals, or to data published in repositories. \nPublishing results is not considered publishing data. \nAs you have no restrictions on sharing, you can consider publishing your data in a repository like RDR. This also ensures the long term preservation of your data after the end of your project.",
