You don't have to mention your own manuscripts, the DMP focuses on the data underlying publications. \n6. Preservation: You mention \"Datasets collected in the context of clinical research\" if you are collecting these please address this under the data and ethics section, otherwise please remove all information that is not relevant for your fellowship. For more information: www.kuleuven.be/english/research/associatienet/ethics/index\n7. Sharing: have you already considered which open access repositories you will use? You mention the the European Genome-Phenome Archive, this is however a repository for personally identifiable genetic data. Maybe a repository such as ebrains or the BioImage Archive are more suitable? For data for which there is no good disciplinary repository you can use KU Leuven RDR: www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr/",
