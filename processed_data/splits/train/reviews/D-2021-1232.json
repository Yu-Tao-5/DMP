Metadata: if you are using kws (or redcap) this also generates metadata that you may use and can mention here.  \n6. Preservation: please note that the guidelines from the UZL ethical committee recommend 25 years of data preservation. \n7. Sharing: you can also consider using a repository for sharing such as KU Leuven RDR (www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr) RDR gives you data a DOI and metadata which makes it better findable and citable, but you can still restrict access if needed so others have to request access via the repository to view it.",
