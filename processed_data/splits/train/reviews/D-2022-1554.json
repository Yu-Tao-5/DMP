Metadata: are you generating any metadata in your experiments? \n7. Sharing: have you considered using a repository for data sharing? If there is no suitable disciplinary repository you can use the KU Leuven data repository RDR: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr, for code you can use KU Leuven gitlab (https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/).",
