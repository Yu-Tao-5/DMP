That is 'data' that you need to include in the DMP and describe how this will be structured, documented, stored, shared, etc. It may be that you compile a database of text extracts / expressions that you then annotate or code. Or maybe you write out notes. Your project description talks about \"systematic research\" and \"concepts\" and \"assumptions\", to there must be something you generate in a structured way I would think, and some way to structure or describe those concepts etc. Describe that in the DMP. That is your data. \n\nIf you're not sure how to do so, you could contact Nele Noppe who provides RDM support for Literature / Arts research: nele.noppe@kuleuven.be",
