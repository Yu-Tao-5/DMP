  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "22/06/2022\r\nPlease note that you used the general KU Leuven template, select the FWO template in DMPonline for your future FWO DMPs, this has some additional questions regarding to storage but since you don't mention very large datasets there I don't expect any issues there. \n1. Data: If you collect any physical samples please also describe these in the table \n2. Metadata: Are your instruments collecting any metadata with your measurements, for example CXI for XRD? You can find more information about metadata for proteomics in the elixir RDM kit: https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/proteomics\n7. Sharing: Lirias is a publication repository and is not suitable for data sharing, you can use KU Leuven RDR instead (https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr) or consider domain specific repositories, f1000 research gives good recommendations https://f1000research.com/for-authors/data-guidelines\nYou can always contact onderzoek2bergen@kuleuven.be if you like to learn more about metadata and data repositories",
