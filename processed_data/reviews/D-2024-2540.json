[REDACTED] products of your mathematical reasoning and thinking, such as f.i. proofs or theorems, are considered to be your data. [REDACTED] is common practice among mathematicians to enter the articles containing the proofs of theorems and other products of their thinking as data in the data summary. [REDACTED] is perfectly acceptable. [REDACTED] to add one line to the datatable in the FWO-template, for example: [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (or however you like to describe you results) [REDACTED] purely theoretical mathematical reasonings and proofs contained in published articles (or whatever description you prefer) [REDACTED] or reused: [REDACTED] new data [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] .pdf [REDACTED] data volume: NA. [REDACTED] far as documentation is concerned, you could refer to the articles as containing all necessary documentation needed to understand your results. [REDACTED] far as metadata are concerned: if the journal uses the [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (MSC), then just mention that as metadata. [REDACTED] even a metadata standard. [REDACTED] far as sharing and preservation are concerned, I would refer to the journals for preservation to [REDACTED] for sharing. [REDACTED] in arXiv are only considered as open access by the funders if they are peer reviewed versions of the articles. [REDACTED] advise to always answer all questions, if only by [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] [REDACTED] the questions about responsibilities at the end of the DMP it should be possible to refer to yourself and/or your PI.
