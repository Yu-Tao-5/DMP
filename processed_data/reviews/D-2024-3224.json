  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "31/03/2025 I notice you've only entered a single dataset (your bibliography) and state you only work with physical data (books and articles). [REDACTED] fact, everything that leads up to actual publications is considered \"data\": this includes books and articles you may consult, but also, for example, the bibliographic references themselves and any notes you might take during your research. [REDACTED] this light, I think it's best to be a bit more detailed in your data summary and hence your plan in general. [REDACTED] are some questions I have: - [REDACTED] you not consulting any digitizations of articles, books, or [REDACTED] works? [REDACTED] you are, are you storing these somewhere on your computer or finding them elsewhere? - [REDACTED] do you take research notes? [REDACTED] you using a particular program or physical notebooks to do so? [REDACTED] you're only writing physical notes, it's best to periodically make digital copies of these, since KU [REDACTED] policy (https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/policy) asks that the university has access to all data. - [REDACTED] you using OneDrive or any other storage solution to save other materials (like article drafts or any relevant data)? - [REDACTED] do you maintain your bibliography? [REDACTED] you using a reference manager like [REDACTED] [REDACTED] like [REDACTED] create structure by adding metadata -- essentially, information about your data. - [REDACTED] you documenting your workflow or process in saving notes/your bibliography/other materials (in a README file, for example)? [REDACTED] it's fairly straightforward, that's fine, of course, but it's worth thinking about doing so to ensure you can still easily understand your data in the future. - [REDACTED] there are no privacy-related or ethical issues that prevent you from doing so, KU [REDACTED] and the FWO strongly encourage you to share materials through a repository (like KU [REDACTED] RDR). [REDACTED] very easy to upload, for instance, an annotated bibliography to RDR (as a companion to an article or book): in doing so, your dataset is assigned a DOI, so you can cite it as you would an article and add it to your publication list. [REDACTED] way, you can improve the visibility of your research. I realize that the DMP and its language might seem to be geared towards experimental or quantitative research, but FWO and KU [REDACTED] are increasingly considering it a priority in the humanities as well (and FWO can request to check your DMP). [REDACTED] more, it can be a genuinely useful tool to think about securing and sharing your research beyond traditional publications. I recommend you have a look at the hands-on guide to research data management in the humanities (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14179688): it goes step-by-step through the different parts of the DMP and provides example answers. [REDACTED] you need any further advice or just want to talk about data management in your project, feel free to reach out to me (sam.urlings@kuleuven.be) or the RDM helpdesk (rdm@kuleuven.be).",
