  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "31/05/2024 [REDACTED] your DMP mainly gives general information about how data will be managed within the consortium during the course of the project, which is important as a guideline for the consortium members, however, the expectation of the [REDACTED] commission is for [REDACTED] [REDACTED] projects that you clearly describe in a DMP how data will be managed according to the FAIR principles [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] including how you will make data available for reuse by others via a trusted data repository according to the principle “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. [REDACTED] the other hand, information about peer reviewed publications is not in the scope of a DMP [REDACTED] EC therefore has a DMP template for [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (HE) projects, which you can find via the EU portal under [REDACTED] reporting templates' https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/temp-form/report/data-management-plan_he_en.docx [REDACTED] it is best to check which questions in the HE DMP template are currently not answered in your DMP and to rewrite the FAIR section according to this template using the headings [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] to be as specific as possible, list repositories to be used, how these repositories help to make data FAIR, how data will be documented and which standards you will use. [REDACTED] keep in mind that the EC may ask to rewrite the DMP based on the HE DMP template. [REDACTED] can find example DMPs here: https://www.groupware.kuleuven.be/sites/dmpmt/Pages/Search/SearchExamples.aspx",
