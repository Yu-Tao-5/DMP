[REDACTED] [REDACTED] you collect any physical samples please also describe these in the table 2. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] your instruments collecting any metadata with your measurements, for example CXI for XRD? [REDACTED] can find more information about metadata for proteomics in the elixir RDM kit: https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/proteomics 7. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] is a publication repository and is not suitable for data sharing, you can use KU [REDACTED] RDR instead (https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr) or consider domain specific repositories, f1000 research gives good recommendations https://f1000research.com/for-authors/data-guidelines [REDACTED] can always contact onderzoek2bergen@kuleuven.be if you like to learn more about metadata and data repositories",
