[REDACTED] data transferred from those ICUs to [REDACTED] [REDACTED] yes, then presumably you have data sharing agreements in place for transfer of personal data, which needs mentioning in 3.4. [REDACTED] this then affects data sharing described in section 7. Please include all essential data management and security aspects for these data coming from 4 separate sites. [REDACTED] 3: the DMP needs to include the EC approval number as reference for processing personal data.",
