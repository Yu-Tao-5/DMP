[REDACTED] is a bit in contradiction with the answer [REDACTED] to the question about reuse of existing data in the data summary. [REDACTED] you publish data alongside your publications, then there is a fair chance that the journal will ask to do so in a repository, either one suggested by the journal or one you are free to choose. [REDACTED] might say something about this if you think it is relevant. 6 [REDACTED] sharing I would add “or after approval” to [REDACTED] access only” in the second question because you mention the possibility of access on approval in your answer to the first question.

[REDACTED] the present version this is a bit inconsistent. A CC-BY license does not make much sense if the data will only be accessible upon approval. A specific data transfer agreement seems more appropriate. 12/03/2024 2 [REDACTED] summary: you might consider to split the last row (protocols etc) in two rows, one for protocols and SOP’s and one for presentations and publications because they have a different relationship to the project. 3 [REDACTED] and metadata: you might provide some more detail about exactly which metadata will be kept in the xml-files. 5 [REDACTED] preservation after the project: [REDACTED] mention the possibility of reusing SOP’s from earlier projects.
