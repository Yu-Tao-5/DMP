  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "08/07/2022 [REDACTED] information for [REDACTED] description (section 2) and [REDACTED] (section 4) is confusing and mingled. [REDACTED] to keep those separate, so in 2 you list / describe datasets and in 4 their documentation. [REDACTED] methods and SOPs are documentation (describing how data are created), not data. [REDACTED] figures are not datasets as such. [REDACTED] the SOURCE, TYPE, FORMAT info in section 4 seems to belong in section 2. [REDACTED] seems that the different data types you will use / generate are serum samples, clinical data about the patients (cohorts and controls), mass spectrometry data, purified antibodies, antibody sequencing data, antibody expression plasmids, flow cytometry data and antibody characteristics. [REDACTED] you have processed data. [REDACTED] those in the table in section 2. [REDACTED] in section 4 the documentation for each of these datasets (data types). [REDACTED] will serum samples, antibodies, plasmids be preserved? [REDACTED] so, where?",
