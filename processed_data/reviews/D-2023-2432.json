  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "29/02/2024 - [REDACTED] you process personal data? : [REDACTED] refer to G-number again - [REDACTED] [REDACTED] you use a [REDACTED] data analysis tool like NVivo to analyze the interview transcripts? [REDACTED] yes, you can mention this here. - [REDACTED] storage: [REDACTED] you store three different copies of the data on 1) [REDACTED] 2) OneDrive and 3) [REDACTED] drive? [REDACTED] is not very clear and also not necessary to have three back ups. - [REDACTED] sharing: [REDACTED] section needs more attention because it is not very clear how you will share the data. [REDACTED] I understand correctly the ySKILLS dataset will be deposited on RDR. [REDACTED] the qualitative data contain personal data, the transcripts will probably be pseudonymized and be put in restricted access on RDR. [REDACTED] a dataset is in restricted access in RDR it receives a \"custom KU [REDACTED] license\" = researchers (or others) will have to make a request to be able to use the dataset; then a data sharing agreement will be drawn up. [REDACTED] this is the case, you can mention this under the question \"data usage license\". A CC-BY license is only for open available data. Please also note the difference between KU [REDACTED] RDR (data repository where you can publish/deposit research data) and [REDACTED] (KU [REDACTED] repository for academic publications like articles, book chapters, etc.). [REDACTED] is however definitely a link between the two: when you publish research data in RDR, it will automatically appear in your [REDACTED] publication list. [REDACTED] more information on RDR: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr",
