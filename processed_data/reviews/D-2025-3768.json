  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "14/03/2025 [REDACTED] [REDACTED] DMP. [REDACTED] you used the [REDACTED] 2020 template, while your fellowship falls under [REDACTED] [REDACTED] I recommend transferring the DMP to the [REDACTED] [REDACTED] template, which is very similar. [REDACTED] can copy and paste most of the information into the new template. [REDACTED] policy documents and statements are data that are not generated in you project, these are existing or reused data. I assume this data is already shared by the EU so you can just refer to these documents in your work; otherwise also have a look if there are restrictions to share them as part of your datasets. [REDACTED] share the pseudonymized transcripts you can restrict access to these files in RDR, interested researchers have to submit a request and sign a data transfer agreement that the [REDACTED] department and RDR team will draft with you before receiving the data. [REDACTED] a look a this dataset for example where the metadata is open as well as the files not containing sensitive data, whereas the survey answers are restricted. https://rdr.kuleuven.be/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.48804/2QQC57 [REDACTED] vocabularies will you use, will you add documentation such as a codebook or readme files to the data? [REDACTED] more information see: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/documentation-metadata/vocabularies I expect that the [REDACTED] [REDACTED] will approve your DMP without any issue, however, if you like to discuss you DMP in more detail to get practical tips on data management you can always contact my colleagues at onderzoek2bergen (onderzoek2bergen@kuleuven.be). [REDACTED] can already submit your DMP, keep in mind that a DMP is a living document that you can update and enrich throughout your project.",
