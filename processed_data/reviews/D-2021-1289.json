[REDACTED] you give an estimation of the total volume of data that you are collecting, this may help you to assess if you have sufficient storage space or need to contact ICTS to discuss which other solutions are available, if you only collect small datasets you can just give a maximum total volume.

[REDACTED] and [REDACTED] please describe here how you document your work, for example via comments in code, using SOPs or (e)-notebooks, by adding readme files, using metadata generated with your measurements etc. 7.
