[REDACTED] a few small remarks relating to [REDACTED] data openly accessible” and [REDACTED] of resources and data security”: - [REDACTED] mention “all relevant data”. [REDACTED] might deduce from this that there are other data, irrelevant for the publication but maybe relevant in different contexts either for yourselves or for others. [REDACTED] there really no attempt to keep such data available in some way? - [REDACTED] is no further associated metadata, documentation or code applicable to the project”: you might add “outside of those contained in the publication”. [REDACTED] probably contain keywords and MSC subjects. - [REDACTED] you have APC’s to pay for publishing in [REDACTED] [REDACTED] journals it might be a good idea to mention those under [REDACTED] of resources and data security”.
