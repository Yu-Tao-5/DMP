[REDACTED] details not known yet at this moment can be collected during the project and added to the final dmp. A few small comments: - [REDACTED] always refer to domain specific repositories upto the question [REDACTED] will the data be made available?” where you suddenly mention general repositories such as [REDACTED] [REDACTED] easily be made consistent in the final dmp. - [REDACTED] [REDACTED] a metadatastandard be used?” I suggest to change “standard metadata” into “standard metadata scheme”. - [REDACTED] might mention who’s covering the costs for the storage on KU [REDACTED] and UGent-PSB servers, f.e. the faculty or the research group.
