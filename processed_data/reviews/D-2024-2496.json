[REDACTED] - it is stated that ethics approval for the use of the EPaNIC was obtained. [REDACTED] it is not clear whether the retrospective use of the data within the current study is covered by that approval.

GitHub which you describe for sharing will preserve your data as well so you can add this under preservation; but you can also import your data from GitHub in RDR and make it available there under a DIO via the integration dashboard.",
