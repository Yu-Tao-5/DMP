  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "16/05/2024 [REDACTED] preservation and sharing sections are still a bit confusing; you mention RDR for archiving but you can only use RDR for archiving if you also share your data here which you don't indicate under sharing. [REDACTED] sharing you mention to add an open acces license and PID but not that you share your data or use a repository. [REDACTED] can wait to update this towards the end of your fellowship when you know where you will archive and possibly share your data. [REDACTED] more information see https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/data-sharing and https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr 25/04/2024 [REDACTED] [REDACTED] list surveys in the data table and indicate working with personal data under reuse, but answer no to the question whether you process personal data. Please correct this and also indicate whether there are ethical issues, add you PRET/SMEC approval number, or indicate when you are planning to apply (before data collection). [REDACTED] you describe RDR for storage and data preservation, but not for data sharing. Please note that RDR is a data repository for data publishing which preserves data as well, but you can't use RDR just for storage or archiving without sharing, see https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr; do you maybe mean the active data platform ManGO? https://rdm-docs.icts.kuleuven.be/mango/index.html? otherwise have a look at the storage guide for other solutions: https://icts.kuleuven.be/storagewijzer/en 25/04/2024 [REDACTED] [REDACTED] list surveys in the data table and indicate working with personal data under reuse, but answer no to the question whether you process personal data.
