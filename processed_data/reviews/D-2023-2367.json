[REDACTED] should be uploaded using the FWO [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] added some comments on the content as well, they may be relevant when moving the information to the new file. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] data will you collect or create? FWO expects to see some information about the size of the data. [REDACTED] table proposed in the [REDACTED] [REDACTED] DMP makes it easier to present the data and their expected size. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] documentation and metadata will accompany the data? [REDACTED] answer is about the data themselves, not about documentation and metadata. [REDACTED] would be about things like readme files, protocols, or EXIF and IPTC metadata for images. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] will you manage copyright and [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] (IPR) issues? [REDACTED] is not an answer to this question, but to the one about [REDACTED] IPR is about patents, copyright and the like. [REDACTED] can arrange a meeting, if you want, to discuss the DMP. [REDACTED] regards, [REDACTED] [REDACTED]",
