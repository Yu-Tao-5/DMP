  "InitialFeedbackHistory": "19/07/2024 [REDACTED] [REDACTED] seems like you have used an old DMP template. [REDACTED] advise you to use DMP online to write and create your DMP. DMP online will provide you with the correct template and you will get funder-related guidance. [REDACTED] are some differences between both templates but you will be able to copy and paste most of this template into the new one. [REDACTED] description: [REDACTED] the new template, you can indicate whether any of these data are physical or digital. [REDACTED] preservation after the FWO project: Note that the KU [REDACTED] RDM policy requires you to store all relevant data up to 10 years after the end of the project. [REDACTED] sharing and reuse: [REDACTED] new DMP template will ask you additional questions on this section make sure to fill them in as well (e.g. [REDACTED] on licences and persistent identifiers). I see you have indirectly added licence information here as well. [REDACTED] can incorporate that into the new DMP template.",
