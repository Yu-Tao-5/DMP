[REDACTED] can consult the storage guide to see if there are better solutions, a teams site for example gives access to all researchers without linking it to one researcher's account, see https://icts.kuleuven.be/storagewijzer/en. [REDACTED] Please note that KU [REDACTED] RDR is a repository for data sharing, it will preserve your shared data as well, but can not be used for long term storage only, for more information see https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr [REDACTED] Please explain whether you will share your data with researchers outside of your team via a trusted data repository such as KU [REDACTED] RDR, or a disciplinary repository if available, for more information see: https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/data-sharing.
