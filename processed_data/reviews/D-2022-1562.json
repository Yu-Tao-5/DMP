[REDACTED] and metadata: [REDACTED] documentation will you use, for example notebooks, protocols etc. DDI is a standard for social sciences and may not be the most appropriate for your data, you can adjust a general standard such as dublin core, but maybe the metadata collected with microCT and microscopy are already sufficient? 7. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] you considered using a data repository for data preservation and sharing? [REDACTED] the EMBL-EBI repositories may be suitable (www.ebi.ac.uk/submission/). [REDACTED] there is no disciplinary repository for your data you can consider using KU [REDACTED] RDR (www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/rdr). [REDACTED] you like to learn more about documentation, metadata and data repositories please contact onderzoek2bergen@kuleuven.be 15/09/2022 Thank you for submitting your revised DMP, just 2 small suggestions: 4.

[REDACTED] this stage of the project FWO asks a more elaborate data management plan. [REDACTED] write this you can use DMPonline KU [REDACTED] (https://dmponline.kuleuven.be/), selecting the FWO template, here you can also find guidance. [REDACTED] you can use the word template that you can find on the FWO website (www.fwo.be/en/the-fwo/research-policy/data-management-plan/).
